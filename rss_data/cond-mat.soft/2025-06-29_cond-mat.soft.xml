      <title>Droplet growth, Ostwald's rule, and emergence of order in Fused in Sarcoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low complexity domain of Fused in Sarcoma (FUS-LC consisting of 214 residues) undergoes phase separation, resulting in a dense liquid-like phase that forms early and slowly matures to reach ordered gel-like state on long time scales. Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in the N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a non-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct forms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a $\beta$-sheet structure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we predict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed by core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and their stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's rule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the dense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase, which forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure and the simulations show that $\beta$-strand emerges in the core-3 region early during the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The techniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of other IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Origin of Friction Between Suspended Rough Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tangential interactions between particles play a central role in suspension rheology. We show theoretically that these interactions, often attributed to contact friction, are a direct consequence of fluid flows between rough particles in relative motion. We find that small surface asperities generically lead to localized hydrodynamic sliding forces and torques that can exceed their smooth counterparts by orders of magnitude. A fully analytic thin-film theory shows that these forces grow inversely with the surface separation, significantly more singular than the logarithmic scaling for smooth particles. The impending singularity tightly constrains the particles' rotation with their translation, recovering a crucial ingredient in dense suspension rheology. Despite their purely hydrodynamic origin, these features resemble several aspects of dry rolling and sliding friction.</description>

      <title>Topological Defect Propagation to Classify Knitted Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knits and crochets are mechanical metamaterials with a long history and can typically be produced from a single yarn. Despite the simplicity of the manufacturing process, they exhibit a wide range of structural configurations with diverse mechanical properties and application potential. Although there has been recent growing interest in textile-based metamaterials, a rigorous topological characterization of what makes a structure knittable has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce a general criterion based on topological constraints that distinguishes knits and crochets from other textile structures. We demonstrate how the introduction of topological defects and their propagation makes this classification practical. Our approach highlights a fundamental link between manufacturing processes and structural fragility. Within this framework, we show how the rationalization of defect propagation unlocks the design of fabrics with controllable resistance to damage.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale properties of protein clusters determine the size and nature of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) in biological cells has dramatically shifted the paradigm that soluble proteins are uniformly dispersed in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. The LLPS region is preceded by a one-phase solution, where recent experiments have identified clusters in an aqueous solution with 102-103 proteins. Here, we theoretically consider a core-shell model with mesoscale core, surface, and bending properties of the cluster shell and contrast two experimental paradigms for the measured cluster size distributions of the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding-4 (CPEB4) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) proteins. The fits to the theoretical model and earlier electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments suggest that the same protein may exhibit hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic conformations, which act to stabilize the clusters. We find that CPEB4 clusters are much more stable compared to FUS clusters, which are less energetically favorable. This suggests that in CPEB4, LLPS consists of large-scale aggregates of clusters, while for FUS, clusters coalesce to form micron-scale LLPS domains.</description>

      <title>Pressure dependence of liquid iron viscosity from machine-learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a machine-learning potential that accurately models the behavior of iron under the conditions of Earth's core. By performing numerous nanosecond scale equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the viscosities of liquid iron for the whole outer core conditions are obtained with much less uncertainty. We find that the Einstein-Stokes relation is not accurate for outer core conditions. The viscosity is on the order of 10s \si{mPa.s}, in agreement with previous first-principles results. We present a viscosity map as a function of pressure and temperature for liquid iron useful for geophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short or long range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that anti-align or even interact non-reciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and anti-parallel flocking over runand chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random non-reciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. As soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random non-reciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multi-species flocking models with non-random but complex non-reciprocal inter-species interactions.</description>

      <title>Entropy of self-avoiding branching polymers: mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-assembly of Dipolar Crystals from Magnetic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the self-assembly of magnetic colloids using the Stockmayer (SM) model characterized by short-range Lennard-Jones interactions and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we design cooling protocols that yield perfectly assembled single-domain magnetic crystals. We identify cooling rates at which the system transforms from an amorphous glass to a crystal, where magnetic ordering promotes crystalline order. Remarkably, we observe that the latter develops via a spontaneous transition rather than through the traditional nucleation and growth mechanism. For a weakly dipolar fluid ($\mu=1$), this self-assembly results in a face-centered cubic (FCC) colloidal crystal with dipole moments chained along the (111) direction. For fluids with higher dipole moment ($\mu = 2.5$), the crystal structure shifts towards a body-centered orthorhombic (BCO) arrangement due to the compression of chains from strong dipolar attractions. These results provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving crystallization in magnetic fluids, opening new avenues for understanding the formation of magnetically responsive colloidal magnetic crystals with promising applications.</description>

      <title>Shape instabilities driven by topological defects in nematic polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid crystalline networks (LCNs) are stimuli-responsive materials formed from polymeric chains cross-linked with rod-like mesogenic segments, which, in the nematic phase, align along a non-polar director. A key characteristic of these nematic systems is the existence of singularities in the director field, known as topological defects or disclinations, and classified by their topological charge. In this study, we address the open question of modeling mathematically the coupling between mesogens disclination and polymeric network by providing a mathematical framework describing the out-of-plane shape changes of initially flat LCN sheets containing a central topological defect. Adopting a variational approach, we define an energy associated with the deformations consisting of two contributions: an elastic energy term accounting for spatial director variations, and a strain-energy function describing the elastic response of the polymer network. The interplay between nematic elasticity, which seeks to minimize distortions in the director field, variations in the degree of order, with the consequent tendency of monomers in the polymer chains to distribute anisotropically in response to an external stimulus, and mechanical stiffness, which resists deformation, determines the resulting morphology. We analyze the transition to instability of the ground-state flat configuration and characterize the corresponding buckling modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systematically investigate the influence of zwitterionic osmolyte additives to an electrolyte solution on disjoining pressure and electric differential capacitance within charged slit-like nanopores with conductive walls. We demonstrate that increasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes synergistically enhance both disjoining pressure and differential capacitance, highlighting their dual role in the potential improvement of supercapacitor performance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of zwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the properties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between capacitive efficiency and microporous electrode longevity.</description>

Abstract: We present results of LAMMPS Molecular Dynamics simulations of 2D gravity-driven flows of 30,000 soft uniform spheres through a vertical silo. We vary the gravitational field (g), elastic modulus of the particles (E), and silo outlet diameter (D). We present results on upwards pressure waves observed in the system. We compare our results with previous work on granular acoustics. Despite the typical particle speed being substantially less than the measured wave speed, we posit these are nonlinear shock waves, as observed in other systems near jamming. We demonstrate that the wave speeds in all systems appear to follow a power law that is distinct from linear wave expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction lifetimes between condensate-forming biomolecules can dictate both the specificity of the condensate-forming species as well as the fluidity and exchange dynamics of these condensates. Using a heuristic modeling approach, we show that single-step vs. sequential, multistep binding-unbinding interactions between proteins can lead to similar average interaction lifetimes, but with either exponential or truncated power-law-like lifetime distributions, respectively. Combining this model with Brownian dynamics simulations, we find that the differences in these lifetime distributions influence the features of condensates, such as their fluidic nature, aging, and size distribution.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the condensation of liquid droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. A stochastic mesoscale model based on the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics of a diffuse interface approach shows how direct simulation of the vapour-liquid transition from the nucleation process to droplet hydrodynamics can be achieved. Such simulations explain the role of wettability in filmwise and dropwise condensation regimes and the main limitations of classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Nano-silica based Aqueous Colloidal Gels as Eco-friendly Thixotropic Lubricant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environmental risks posed by traditional oil and grease-based lubricants can be significantly mitigated by adopting water-based alternatives engineered with superior rheological performance. In this work, we present a fundamentally new and environmentally sustainable aqueous thixotropic colloidal gel of silica nanoparticles formed in the presence of NaCl. We conducted a systematic and detailed investigation of their rheological and tribological characteristics. The tribological performance was evaluated against dry and water-lubricated conditions for steel-steel interface. Our experiments demonstrate that the tribological performance of the formulated nanoparticle gel can be optimized by tuning its rheological properties. A combination of super-low friction and negligible wear was observed. The friction coefficient reduced by up to 97.46% (from 0.63 to 0.016) compared to dry sliding, and by 97.04% (from 0.541 to 0.016) compared to water lubrication. Similarly, the specific wear rate decreased by up to 99.62% and 96.10% under dry conditions and water lubrication respectively. This performance is attributed to a thixotropic, chemically robust gel formed via van der Waals interactions between silica flocs, enabling self-repairing properties, continuous tribo-film formation, and a nano-bearing effect from silica nanoparticles. These attributes enable the gel to maintain and regain its structure during periods of non-shear while also forming a thin film with sufficiently low viscosity to slip into the interfacial contact zone and continuously replenish it with lubricant.</description>

Abstract: We present a graph theoretical approach to the configurational statistics of random tree-like objects, such as randomly branching polymers. In particular, for ideal trees we show that Pr\"ufer labelling provides: (i) direct access to the exact configurational entropy as a function of the tree composition, (ii) computable exact expressions for partition functions and important experimental observables for tree ensembles with controlled branching activity and (iii) an efficient sampling scheme for corresponding tree configurations and arbitrary static properties.</description>

Abstract: We show that the formalism of Wertheim's first order thermodynamic perturbation theory can be generalised for the fluid of rotating sticky particles with anisotropic hard core confined to a quasi-one-dimensional channel. Using the transfer matrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction is additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick together only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of association in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural and thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and fraction of sites unbonded.</description>
