      <title>Relativistic Correction to Black Hole Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relativistic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the canonical ensemble and isothermal-isobaric ensemble and apply it to the cases of non-rotating BTZ and AdS-Schwarzschild black holes. This is realized by generalizing the equations obtained using Boltzmann-Gibbs(BG) statistics with its relativistic generalization, Kaniadakis statistics, or $\kappa$-statistics. The relativistic corrections are found to be logarithmic in nature and it is observed that their effect becomes appreciable in the high-temperature limit suggesting that the entropy corrections must include these relativistically corrected terms while taking the aforementioned limit. The non-relativistic corrections are recovered in the $\kappa\rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <title>Recovering semiclassical Einstein's equation using generalized entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that the Semiclassical Einstein's Field Equation can be recovered using the generalized entropy $S_{gen}$. This approach is reminiscent of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Furthermore, contrary to the entanglement equilibrium approach of deriving the semiclassical Einstein's equation, this approach does not require any such assumptions and still recovers its correct form. Therefore, in a sense, we also show the validity of the semiclassical approximation, a crucial approach for establishing a number of important ideas such as the Hawking effect.</description>

      <title>Partial absence of cosine problem in 3d Lorentzian spin foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical limit of the recently proposed coherent spin foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. Specifically, we analyze the gluing equations derived from the stationary phase approximation of the vertex amplitude. Typically these exhibit two solutions yielding a cosine of the Regge action. However, by inspection of the algebraic equations as well as their geometrical realization, we show in this note that the behavior is more nuanced: when all triangles are either spacelike or timelike, two solutions exist. In any other case, only a single solution is obtained, thus yielding a single Regge exponential.</description>

      <title>Comparing advanced-era interferometric gravitational-wave detector network configurations: sky localization and source properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion and upgrade of the global network of ground-based gravitational wave detectors promises to improve our capacity to infer the sky-localization of transient sources, enabling more effective multi-messenger follow-ups. At the same time, the increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of detected events allows for more precise estimates of the source parameters. This study aims to assess the performance of advanced-era networks of ground-based detectors, focusing on the Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA instruments. We use full Bayesian parameter estimation procedures to predict the scientific potential of a network. Assuming a fixed LIGO configuration, we find that the addition of the Virgo detector is beneficial to the sky localization starting from a binary neutron star horizon distance of 20 Mpc and improves significantly from 40 Mpc onwards for both a single and double LIGO detector network, reducing the inferred mean sky-area by up to 95%. Similarly, the KAGRA detector tightens the constraints, starting from a sensitivity range of 10 Mpc. Looking at highly-spinning binary black holes, we find significant improvements with increasing sensitivity in constraining the intrinsic source parameters when adding Virgo to the two LIGO detectors. Finally, we also examine the impact of the low-frequency cut-off data on the signal-to-noise ratio. We find that existing 20 Hz thresholds are sufficient and propose a metric to monitor this to study detector performance. Our findings quantify how future enhancements in detector sensitivity and network configurations will improve the localization of gravitational wave sources and allow for more precise identification of their intrinsic properties.</description>

      <title>Covariant phase space analysis of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity with boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel prescription for the expression of the thermodynamic potentials associated with the couplings of a Lanczos-Lovelock theory. These potentials emerge in theories with multiple couplings, where the ratio between them provide intrinsic length scales that break scale invariance. Our prescription, derived from the covariant phase space formalism, differs from previous approaches by enabling the construction of finite potentials without reference to any background. To do so, we consistently work with finite-size systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions and rigorously take into account boundary and corner terms: including these terms is found to be crucial for relaxing the integrability conditions for phase space quantities that were required in previous works. We apply this prescription to the first law of (extended) thermodynamics for stationary black holes, and derive a version of the Smarr formula that holds for static black holes with arbitrary asymptotic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Numerical parameterization of stationary axisymmetric black holes in a theory agnostic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of a comprehensive theory of gravity has led to the exploration of various alternative models, necessitating a model-independent framework. The Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parameterization offers a robust method for approximating stationary axisymmetric black hole spacetimes, characterized by a rapidly converging continued-fraction expansion. However, while analytical metrics benefit from this approach, numerical metrics derived from complex gravitational theories remain presenting computational challenges. Bridging this gap, we propose a method for a numerical KRZ parameterization, tested and demonstrated on pseudo-numerical Kerr and Kerr-Sen spacetimes. Our approach involves constructing numerical grids to represent metric coefficients and using the grids for fitting the parameters up to an arbitrary order. We analyze the accuracy of our method across different orders of approximation, considering deviations in the metric functions and shadow images. In both Kerr and Kerr-Sen cases, we observe rapid convergence of errors with increasing orders of continued fractions, albeit with variations influenced by spin and charge. Our results underscore the potential of the proposed algorithm for parameterizing numerical metrics, offering a pathway for further investigations across diverse gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Particulate Quantum States of the Electromagnetic Field in Expanding Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum field has been coupled to a space-time with accelerating expansion. Dynamical modes are destabilised successively at shorter material wavelengths as they metamorphose from oscillators to repellers. Due to degeneracy of energy levels, the number of unstable modes increases at an accelerating rate, sufficient to account for a significant proportion of cosmic energy. For the subsystem spanned by a finite basis of unstable runaway modes, the quantum Hamiltonian is unbounded below. There is no Bogoliubov transformation by which that subsystem Hamiltonian can be expressed as a linear combination of number operators. For the remaining subsystem spanned by an infinite number of oscillator modes, there is an appropriate vacuum state in a Fock-Cook representation of the field algebra. The massless quantum vector field of electromagnetism is considered when it is minimally or more generally coupled to an expanding space-time. For a significant class of models, including minimal coupling models and the exponential de Sitter universe coupled to the Ricci curvature tensor, the field equations are equivalent to the Proca equation with time-dependent mass.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Formation with Gravitational Particle Creation Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of the formation of a traversable wormhole geometry in General Relativity sustained by particle creation mechanism. Gravitational particle creation mechanism is a thermodynamic approach to generate repulsive back-reaction gravitational effects through the thermodynamic creation of particles. This repulsive back-reaction pressure can be thought of as a source of sustaining a traversable wormhole. In the first part of this paper, we systematically model a wormhole geometry through the process of particle creation by assuming an inverse square variation law of particle creation pressure within the wormhole geometry, and the shape function for the wormhole is obtained, assuming the redshift function as constant and finite. The obtained shape function is found to adhere to the feasibility conditions (flaring out condition and asymptotic flatness condition) of a viable wormhole geometry. In the second part of the paper, again by assuming a constant and finite redshift function, we studied the radial evolutionary behaviour of the particle creation pressures for three commonly utilized toy shape-functions. The examination of the energy conditions namely the Null Energy Condition (NEC) and the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) for all these models reveal that the NEC is violated for the shape-function derived from the first principles of particle creation mechanism, as well as for the toy shape functions. The DEC is however found to be satisfied for all the aforementioned cases. In essence, NEC violation occurs through the particle creation phenomena inside the wormhole structure in spite of the existence of non-exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Avoiding singularities in Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes: the role of atemporality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Schwarzschild metric exhibiting a signature change across the event horizon, which gives rise to what we term a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole. The resulting geometry is regularized by employing the Hadamard partie finie technique, which allows us to prove that the metric represents a solution of vacuum Einstein equations. In this framework, we introduce the concept of atemporality as the dynamical mechanism responsible for the transition from a regime with a real-valued time variable to a new one featuring an imaginary time. We show that this mechanism prevents the occurrence of the singularity and, by means of the regularized Kretschmann invariant, we discuss in which terms atemporality can be considered as the characteristic feature of this black hole.</description>

      <title>Spherical orbits around Kerr-Newman and Ghosh black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on spherical orbits around two types of black holes: Kerr-Newman black holes, which are charged, and Ghosh black holes, which are nonsingular. In this work, we consider both null and timelike cases of orbits. Utilizing the Mino formalism, all analytical solutions for the geodesics governing these orbits can be obtained. It turns out that all spherical photon orbits outside the black hole horizons are unstable. In the extremal cases of both models, we obtain the {\it photon boomerangs}. The existence of charge in the Kerr-Newman allows the orbits to transition between retrograde and prograde motions, and its increase tends to force the orbits to be more equatorial. On the other hand, the Ghosh black hole, characterized by a regular core and a lack of horizons in certain conditions, presents the possibility of observable stable spherical orbits in the so-called {\it no-horizon} condition. As the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases, trajectories tend to exhibit larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. We observe that as the Ghosh parameter $k$ increases the trajectories tend to have larger latitudinal oscillation amplitudes. Finally, we investigate the existence of {\it innermost stable spherical orbits} (ISSOs). Both black holes demonstrate the appearance of two branches of ISSO radii as a function of the Carter constant C. However, there are notable differences in their behavior: in the case of the Kerr-Newman black hole, the branches merge at a critical value, beyond which no ISSO exists, while for the Ghosh black hole, the transcendental nature of the metric function causes the branches to become complex at some finite distance.</description>

      <title>Lens Stochastic Diffraction: A Signature of Compact Structures in Gravitational-Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every signal propagating through the universe is diffracted by the gravitational fields of intervening objects, aka gravitational lenses. Diffraction is most efficient when caused by compact lenses, which invariably produce additional images of a source. The signals associated with additional images are generically faint, but their collective effect may be detectable with coherent sources, such as gravitational waves (GWs), where both amplitude and phase are measured. Here, I describe lens stochastic diffraction (LSD): Poisson-distributed fluctuations after GW events caused by compact lenses. The amplitude and temporal distribution of these signals encode crucial information about the mass and abundance of compact lenses. Through the collective stochastic signal, LSD offers an order-of-magnitude improvement over single lens analysis for objects with mass $\gtrsim 10^3 M_\odot$. This gain can improve limits on compact dark-matter halos and allows next-generation instruments to detect supermassive black holes, given the abundance inferred from quasar luminosity studies.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quick recipes for gravitational-wave selection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of selection effects is a key ingredient to the success of gravitational-wave astronomy. The detection probability plays a crucial role in both statistical population studies, where it enters the hierarchical Bayesian likelihood, and astrophysical modeling, where it is used to convert predictions from population-synthesis codes into observable distributions. We review the most commonly used approximations, extend them, and present some recipes for a straightforward implementation. These include a closed-form expression capturing both multiple detectors and noise realizations written in terms of the so-called Marcum Q-function and a ready-to-use mapping between signal-to-noise ratio thresholds and false-alarm rates from state-of-the-art detection pipelines. The bias introduced by approximating the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio with the optimal signal-to-noise ratio is not symmetric: sources that are nominally below threshold are more likely to be detected than sources above threshold are to be missed. Using both analytical considerations and software injections in detection pipelines, we confirm that including noise realizations when estimating the selection function introduces an average variation of a few %. This effect is most relevant for large catalogs and specific subpopulations of sources at the edge of detectability (e.g. high redshifts).</description>

      <title>Magic zeroes in the black hole response problem and a Love symmetry resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we present the emergence of an $SL(2,R)$ ("Love") symmetry in the suitably defined near-zone region, relevant for studying the black hole response problem. This symmetry is globally defined and physical solutions of the black hole linearized field equations are closed under its action. The vanishing of static Love numbers is found to naturally arise as a selection rule following from the fact that the relevant solution belongs to a particular highest-weight representation of the Love symmetry. Interestingly, the Love symmetry appears to be connected to the well-known enhanced $SL(2,R)$ isometry subgroup of the near-horizon extremal geometry. Namely, the Love symmetry exactly reduces to the isometry of the near-horizon AdS$_2$ throat for extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, while, for rotating black holes, one is lead to consider an infinite-dimensional $SL(2,R)\ltimes\hat{U}(1)_V$ extension of the Love symmetry, a family of subalgebras of which precisely recovers the Killing vectors of the corresponding AdS$_2$ throat in the extremal limit. Similar results persist when studying perturbations of general-relativistic black holes in higher dimensions. Even though the black hole static Love numbers now vanish only for a discrete set of resonant conditions that depends on the orbital number of the perturbation, Love symmetry exists independently of these details. This hints at a geometric interpretation of the Love symmetry; a statement that becomes more rigorous within the framework of subtracted geometries. However, Love symmetry appears to be theory-dependent. We extract, in particular, a sufficient geometric condition for its existence according to which, for instance, it does not exist in Riemann$^3$ gravity or some stringy-corrected low-energy effective gravitational actions, in accordance with explicit computations of the corresponding black hole Love numbers.</description>

      <title>Global existence and geometry of constant mass aspect function foliation in perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constant mass function foliation has been shown useful for studying the null Penrose inequality on a null hypersurface, because of the monotonicity formula of Hawking mass along such a foliation. In this paper, we show the global existence of the constant mass aspect function foliation on a nearly spherically symmetric incoming null hypersurface, emanating from a spacelike surface near the apparent horizon to the past null infinity in a vacuum perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. Moreover, we study the geometry of the constant mass aspect function foliation, by comparing with the spherically symmetric foliation in the Schwarzschild spacetime. The knowledge about the geometry of the foliation is essential for investigating the perturbation of the constant mass aspect function foliation, which is the core in the application to the null Penrose inequality for a vacuum perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Cosmology-independent Photon Mass Limits from Localized Fast Radio Bursts by using Artificial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hypothetical photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$, can produce a frequency-dependent vacuum dispersion of light, which leads to an additional time delay between photons with different frequencies when they propagate through a fixed distance. The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological model based on the fundamental postulate of the masslessness of photons, here we employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of $m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 2.0 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 6.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 3.6 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$) at the $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence level. This is the first cosmology-independent photon mass limit derived from extragalactic sources.</description>

Abstract: A Bayesian method is used in this extensive work to generate a large set of minimally constrained equations of state (EOSs) for matters in neutron stars (NS). These EOSs are analyzed for their correlations with key NS properties, such as the tidal deformability, radius, and maximum mass, within the mass range of $1.2-2M_\odot$. The observed connections between the pressure of $\beta$-equilibrated matter and the properties of neutron stars at different densities offer significant insights into the behavior of NS matter in a nearly model-independent manner. The study also examines the influence of various factors on the correlation of symmetry energy parameters, such as slope and curvature parameters at saturation density ($\rho_0=0.16 ~\text{fm}^{-3}$) with the tidal deformability and radius of neutron stars. This study investigates the robustness of the observed correlations by considering the distributions and interdependence of symmetry energy parameters. Furthermore, the utilization of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to unveil the complicated relationship between various nuclear matter parameters and properties of neutron stars. This analysis highlights the importance of employing multivariate analysis techniques in order to comprehend the variety in tidal deformability and radius observed across distinct masses of NS. This comprehensive study aims to establish a connection between the parameters of nuclear matter and the properties of neutron stars, providing significant insights into the behavior of NS matter across different circumstances.</description>

      <title>Inflation via Moduli Potentials in a Nested Warped Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effective four-dimensional dynamics of the extra-dimensional moduli fields in curved braneworlds having nested warping, with particular emphasis on the doubly warped model which is interesting in the light of current collider constraints on the mass of the Kaluza-Klein graviton. The presence of a non-zero brane cosmological constant ($\Omega$) naturally induces an effective moduli potential in the four-dimensional action, which shows distinct features in dS ($\Omega&gt;0$) and AdS ($\Omega&lt;0$) branches. For the observationally interesting case of dS 4-branes, a metastable minimum in the potential arises along the first modulus, with no minima along the higher moduli. The underlying nested geometry also leads to interesting separable forms of the non-canonical kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, where the brane curvature directly impacts the kinetic properties of only the first modulus. We subsequently explore the ability of curved multiply warped geometries to drive inflation with an in-built exit mechanism, by assuming predominant slow roll along each modular direction on a case-by-case basis. We find slow roll on top of the metastable plateau along the first modular direction to be the most viable scenario, with the higher-dimensional moduli parametrically tuning the height of the potential without significant impact on the inflationary observables. On the other hand, while slow roll along the higher moduli can successfully inflate the background and eventually lead to an exit, consistency with observations seemingly requires unphysical hierarchies among the extra-dimensional radii, thus disfavouring such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in dense matter relativistic stars induced by internal sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's field equations with a background source term that induces perturbations and the applications of this new formalism to a compact dense matter relativistic star are presented. We introduce a new response kernel in the field equations between the metric and fluid perturbations. A source term which drives or induces the sub-hydro mesoscopic scales perturbations in the astrophysical system, is of importance here. Deterministic as well as stochastic perturbations for the radial case are worked out as solutions of field equations. We also touch upon polar perturbations that are deterministic with oscillatory parts. The stochastic perturbation are of significance in terms of two point or point separated correlations which form the building blocks for studying equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics for the system. Our main aim is to build a theory for intermediate scale physics, for dense exotic matter and investigate structure of the compact astrophysical objects. Specifically, turbulence which connects various scales in superfluid matter in the dense stars is an area gaining importance. The work presented here is the starting point for new theoretical frame work that touches upon various yet unexplored scales where mechanical and dynamical effects interior to the matter of the star are of significance. Thus there is scope for extending studies in asteroseismology to mesoscopic effects at the new intermediate scales in the cold dense matter fluid . This is expected to enable us to probe astrophysical features at refined scales through theoretical formulations as well as for observational consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new mean curvature rigidity theorems of spin fill-ins with non-negative scalar curvature using two different spinorial techniques. Our results address two questions by Miao and Gromov, respectively. The first technique is based on extending boundary spinors satisfying a generalized eigenvalue equation via the Fredholm alternative for an APS boundary value problem, while the second is a comparison result in the spirit of Llarull and Lott using index theory. We also show that the latter implies a new Witten-type integral inequality for the mass of an asymptotically Schwarzschild manifold which holds even when the scalar curvature is not assumed to be non-negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions are ubiquitous tools in quantum field theory from both a fundamental and a practical point of view. However, up to now their use in theories of quantum gravity beyond perturbative and asymptotically flat regimes has been limited, due to difficulties associated with diffeomorphism invariance and the dynamical nature of geometry. We present an analysis of a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, nonperturbative two-point curvature correlator in two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the recently introduced quantum Ricci curvature and uses a lattice regularization of the full path integral in terms of causal dynamical triangulations. We discuss some of the subtleties and ambiguities in defining connected correlators in theories of dynamical geometry, and provide strong evidence from Monte Carlo simulations that the connected two-point curvature correlator in 2D Lorentzian quantum gravity vanishes. This work paves the way for an analogous investigation in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Foundations of a Theory of Gravity with a Constraint and its Canonical Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14612v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational equations were derived in general relativity (GR) using the assumption of their covariance relative to arbitrary transformations of coordinates. It has been repeatedly expressed an opinion over the past century that such equality of all coordinate systems may not correspond to reality. Nevertheless, no actual verification of the necessity of this assumption has been made to date. The paper proposes a theory of gravity with a constraint, the degenerate variants of which are general relativity (GR) and the unimodular theory of gravity. This constraint is interpreted from a physical point of view as a sufficient condition for the adiabaticity of the process of the evolution of the space-time metric. The original equations of the theory of gravity with the constraint are formulated. On this basis, a unified model of the evolution of the modern, early, and very early Universe is constructed that is consistent with the observational astronomical data but does not require the hypotheses of the existence of dark energy, dark matter or inflatons. It is claimed that: physical time is anisotropic, the gravitational field is the main source of energy of the Universe, the maximum global energy density in the Universe was 64 orders of magnitude smaller the Planckian one, and the entropy density is 18 orders of magnitude higher the value predicted by GR. The value of the relative density of neutrinos at the present time and the maximum temperature of matter in the early Universe are calculated. The wave equation of the gravitational field is formulated, its solution is found, and the nonstationary wave function of the very early Universe is constructed. It is shown that the birth of the Universe was random.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non--commutativity as a Perturbation in the Schwarzschild Black Hole: Quasinormal Modes, Scattering, and Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03284v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, by a novel approach to studying the scattering of a Schwarzschild black hole, the non-commutativity is introduced as a perturbation. We begin by reformulating the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field in a new form that takes into account the deformed non-commutative spacetime. Using this formulation, an effective potential for the scattering process is derived. To calculate the quasinormal modes, we employ the WKB method and also utilize fitting techniques to investigate the impact of non-commutativity on the scalar quasinormal modes. We thoroughly analyze the results obtained from these different methods. Moreover, the greybody factor and absorption cross section are investigated. Additionally, we explore the behavior of null geodesics in the presence of non-commutativity. Specifically, we examine the photonic, and shadow radius as well as the light trajectories for different non-commutative parameters. Therefore, by addressing these various aspects, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the influence of non-commutativity on the scattering of a Schwarzschild-like black hole and its implications for the behavior of scalar fields and light trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a relativistic framework to investigate the evolution of cosmological structures from the initial density perturbations to the highly nonlinear regime. Our approach involves proposing a procedure to match ``best-fit", exact Bianchi IX (BIX) spacetimes to finite regions within the perturbed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe characterized by a positive averaged spatial curvature. This method enables us to approximately track the nonlinear evolution of the initial perturbation using an exact solution. Unlike standard perturbation theory and exact solutions with a high degree of symmetry (such as spherical symmetry), our approach is applicable to generic initial data, with the only requirement being positive spatial curvature. By employing the BIX symmetries, we can systematically incorporate the approximate effects of shear and curvature into the process of collapse. Our approach addresses the limitations of both standard perturbation theory and highly symmetric exact solutions, providing valuable insights into the nonlinear evolution of cosmological structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The primary constraints for general teleparallel quadratic gravity are presented. They provide a basic classification of teleparallel theories from the perspective of the full nonlinear theory and represent the first step towards a full-fledged Hamiltonian analysis. The results are consistent with the limit of metric and symmetric teleparallel quadratic gravity. In the latter case we also present novel results, since symmetric teleparallel theories have only been partially studied so far. Apart from the general results, we also present the special cases of teleparallel theories classically equivalent to general relativity, which differ by a boundary term from the formulation of Einstein and Hilbert. This affects the constraint algebra as the primary constraints involve a mix of torsion and non-metricity, implying that the symmetries of general relativity are realized in a more intricate way compared to the teleparallel case. In this context, a more detailed understanding will provide insights for energy and entropy in gravity, quantum gravity and numerical relativity of this alternative formulation of general relativity. The primary constraints are presented both in the standard formulation and in irreducible parts of torsion and non-metricity. The special role of axial torsion and its connection to the one-parameter of viable new general relativity is confirmed. Furthermore, we find that one of the irreducible parts of non-metricity affects the primary constraint for shift but not lapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning model designed to rapidly and accurately predict the time domain gravitational wave emission of non-precessing binary black hole coalescences, incorporating the effects of higher order modes of the multipole expansion of the waveform. Expanding on our prior work, we decompose each mode by amplitude and phase and reduce dimensionality using principal component analysis. An ensemble of artificial neural networks is trained to learn the relationship between orbital parameters and the low-dimensional representation of each mode. Our model is trained with $\sim 10^5$ signals with mass ratio $q \in [1,10]$ and dimensionless spins $\chi_i \in [-0.9, 0.9]$, generated with the state-of-the-art approximant SEOBNRv4HM, and it is able to generate waveforms up to $\sim 4\times 10^5 M$ long. We find that it achieves a median faithfulness of $10^{-4}$ averaged across the parameter space. We show that our model generates a single waveform two orders of magnitude faster than the training model, with the speed up increasing when waveforms are generated in batches. This framework is entirely general and can be applied to any other time domain approximant capable of generating waveforms from aligned spin circular binaries, possibly incorporating higher order modes.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility of avoiding cosmological singularity with a bounce solution in the early Universe. The main finding is that simple and well-known semiclassical correction, which describes the mixing of radiation and gravity in the effective action, may provide an analytic solution with a bounce. The solution requires a positive beta function for the total radiation term and the contraction of the Universe at the initial instant. The numerical estimate shows that the bounce may occur in an acceptable range of energies, but only under strong assumptions about the particle physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical density profile with a misaligned deformation tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulation of primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical profile of the initial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. We consider the background expanding universe filled with the perfect fluid with the linear equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w=1/3$ or $1/5$), where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial condition is set in a way such that the principal directions of the second derivatives of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ at the central peak are misaligned, where $\triangle$ is the Laplacian. In this setting, since the linearized density is proportional to $\triangle \zeta$, the inertia tensor and deformation tensor $\partial_i\partial_j \zeta$ are misaligned. Thus tidal torque may act and the spin of a resultant primordial black hole would be non-zero in general, although it is estimated to be very small from previous perturbative analyses. As a result, we do not find a finite value of the spin within our numerical precision, giving support for the negligibly small value of the black hole spin for $1/5\lesssim w \lesssim 1/3$. More specifically, our results suggest that the dimensionless PBH spin $s$ is typically so small that $s\ll0.1$ for $w\gtrsim0.2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spherically symmetric configurations of the quadratic $f(R)$ gravity in the Einstein frame. In case of a purely gravitational system, we have determined the global qualitative behavior of the metric and the scalaron field for all static solutions satisfying the conditions of asymptotic flatness. These solutions are proved to be regular everywhere except for a naked singularity at the center; they are uniquely determined by the total mass $\mathfrak{M}$ and the "scalar charge" $Q$ characterizing the strength of the scalaron field at spatial infinity. The case $Q=0$ yields the Schwarzschild solution, but an arbitrarily small $Q\ne 0$ leads to the appearance of a central naked singularity having a significant effect on the neighboring region, even when the space-time metric in the outer region is practically insensitive to the scalaron field. Approximation procedures are developed to derive asymptotic relations near the naked singularity and at spatial infinity, and the leading terms of the solutions are presented. We investigate the linear stability of the static solutions with respect to radial perturbations satisfying the null Dirichlet boundary condition at the center and numerically estimate the range of parameters corresponding to stable/unstable configurations. In particular, the configurations with sufficiently small $Q$ turn out to be linearly unstable.</description>

Abstract: The $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories, which catches five degrees of freedom, are valuable for its implications to inflation problems, generation of primordial magnetic fields, new black hole (BH) and neutron star solutions, etc. In this paper, we derive conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities of nontrivial BH solutions dressed with scalar hair against both odd- and even-parity perturbations on top of the static and spherically symmetric background in the most general $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories with second-order equations of motion. In addition to some general discussions, several typical concrete models are investigated. Specially, we show that the stability against even-parity perturbations is ensured outside the event horizon under certain constraints to these models. This is a crucial step to check the self-consistency of the theories and to shed light on the physically accessible models of such theories for future studies.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes as an alternative to black bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called black bounce mechanism of singularity suppression, proposed by Simpson and Visser, consists in replacing the spherical radius $r$ in the metric tensor with $\sqrt{r^2 + a^2}$, $a = \rm const &gt;0$. This removes a singularity at $r=0$ and its neighborhood from space-time, and there emerges a regular minimum of the spherical radius that can be a wormhole throat or a regular bounce (if located inside a black hole). Instead, it is proposed here to make $r=0$ a regular center by proper (Bardeen type) replacements in the metric, preserving its form at large $r$. Such replacements are applied to a class of metrics satisfying the condition $R^t_t = R^r_r$ for their Ricci tensor, in particular, to the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Einstein-Born-Infeld solutions. A simpler version of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) is proposed, for which a black hole solution is similar to the Einstein-Born-Infeld one but is simpler expressed analytically. All new regular metrics can be presented as solutions to NED-Einstein equations with radial magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Orbits around a black bounce spacetime</title>

Abstract: In this work, the trajectories of particles around a black bounce spacetime are considered, with the Simpson-Visser model serving as an example. Trajectories for massless and massive particles are obtained through the study of null and time-like geodesics. As the Simpson-Visser solution is derived via the Einstein equations for a source involving nonlinear electrodynamics and a scalar field, photon trajectories are investigated by considering an effective metric in which photons follow null geodesics. The stability of circular orbits is analyzed by examining the behavior of maxima and minima of the effective potential associated with geodesics. It is also studied what type of geodesic photons follow when the usual metric is considered instead of the effective one. The main focus of this work is to obtain corrections to the trajectories of photons when considering that the solution arises from nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Mixed boundary conditions and Double-trace like deformations in Celestial holography and Wedge-like holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the AdS/CFT dictionary, adding a relevant double-trace deformation $f\int O^2$ to a holographic CFT action is dual to imposing mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions for the field dual to $O$ in AdS. We observed similar behaviour in codimension-two flat space holographies. We consider deformations of boundary conditions in flat spacetimes under flat space co-dimension-two holographies, celestial holography and Wedge-like holography. In the former celestial-holographic approach, we imposed boundary conditions on initial and final bulk states in the scattering. We find that these non-trivial boundary conditions in the bulk induce "double deformations" on the Celestial CFT side, which can be understood as an analogy of double trace deformations in the usual AdS/CFT. We compute two-point bulk scattering amplitudes under the non-trivial deformed boundary conditions. In the latter Wedge-like holography approach, we consider mixed Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions on the null infinity of the light-cone. We find that this mixing induces a renormalization flow in the dual Wedge CFT side under the Wedge holography, as in the usual AdS/CFT. We argue that the discrepancy between the Wedge two-point function and the Celestial two-point function originates from a sensitivity of bulk massless fields to a regularization parameter to use the usual AdS/CFT techniques.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Background Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the interpretation of the detected signal by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations as a gravitational wave background (GWB) of cosmological origin. We combine NANOGrav 15-years and EPTA-DR2new data sets and confront them against backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), and cosmological signals from inflation, cosmic (super)strings, first-order phase transitions, Gaussian and non-Gaussian large scalar fluctuations, and audible axions. We find that scalar-induced, and to a lesser extent audible axion and cosmic superstring signals, provide a better fit than SMBHBs. These results depend, however, on modeling assumptions, so further data and analysis are needed to reach robust conclusions. Independently of the signal origin, the data strongly constrain the parameter space of cosmological signals, for example, setting an upper bound on primordial non-Gaussianity at PTA scales as $|f_{nl}| \lesssim 2.34$ at 95% CL.</description>

      <title>A volume-renormalized mass for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a geometric quantity for asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, which we call the volume-renormalized mass. It is essentially a linear combination of the ADM mass surface integral and a renormalization of the volume.
  We show that the volume-renormalized mass is well-defined and diffeomorphism invariant under weaker fall-off conditions than required to ensure that the renormalized volume and the ADM mass surface integral are well-defined separately. We prove several positivity results for the volume-renormalized mass. We also use it to define a renormalized Einstein--Hilbert action and a renormalized expander entropy which is nondecreasing under the Ricci flow. Further, we show that local maximizers of the entropy are local minimizers of the volume-renormalized mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel amplitude bootstrap technique manifestly free of unphysical poles for classically spinning particles interacting with gravitons utilizing only the double-copy and physical factorization limits. Combined with non-factorization polynomial contact contributions from physical data for Kerr black holes, we can address high-spin-order covariant gravitational Compton amplitudes, identifying a pattern for the amplitude that we believe could extend to all orders in spin. Finally, we outline applications and outstanding questions.</description>

      <title>Imaging thick accretion disks and jets surrounding black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the horizon-scale magnetofluid model developed in [arXiv:2309.13304], we investigate the millimeter-wave images of a geometrically thick accretion disk or a funnel wall, i.e., the magnetofluid that encloses the base of the jet region, around a Kerr black hole. By employing the numerical method to solve the null geodesic and radiative transfer equations, we obtain the optical appearances at various observational angles and frequencies, generated by the thermal synchrotron radiation within the magnetofluid. For the thick disk, we specifically examine the impact of emission anisotropy on images, concluding that anisotropic synchrotron radiation could play an important role in the observability of the photon ring. For the funnel wall, we find that both the outflow and inflow funnel walls exhibit annular structures on the imaging plane. The outflow funnel wall yields a brighter primary image than the photon ring, whereas the inflow one does not. Based on our investigation, the inflow funnel wall model can not be ruled out by current observations of M87*.</description>

      <title>Love numbers and Love symmetries for $p$-form and gravitational perturbations of higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The static Love numbers of four-dimensional asymptotically flat, isolated, general-relativistic black holes are known to be identically vanishing. The Love symmetry proposal suggests that such vanishings are addressed by selection rules following from the emergence of an enhanced $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ ("Love") symmetry in the near-zone region; more specifically, it is the fact that the black hole perturbations belong to a highest-weight representation of this near-zone $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry, rather than the existence of the Love symmetry itself, that outputs the vanishings of the corresponding Love numbers. In higher spacetime dimensions, some towers of magic zeroes with regards to the black hole response problem have also been reported for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. Here, we extend these results by supplementing with $p$-form perturbations of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole. We furthermore analytically extract the static Love numbers and the leading order dissipation numbers associated with spin-$0$ scalar and spin-$2$ tensor-type tidal perturbations of the higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We find that Love symmetries exist and that the vanishings of the static Love numbers are captured by representation theory arguments even for these higher spin perturbations of the higher-dimensional spherically symmetric black holes of General Relativity. Interestingly, these near-zone $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ structures acquire extensions to Witt algebras. Our setup allows to also study the $p$-form response problem of a static spherically symmetric black hole in a generic theory of gravity. We perform explicit computations for some black holes in the presence of string-theoretic corrections and investigate under what geometric conditions Love symmetries emerge in the near-zone.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>
