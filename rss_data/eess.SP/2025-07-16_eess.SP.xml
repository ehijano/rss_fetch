      <title>A Leap-on-Success Exhaustive Search Method to Find Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs): New Array Configurations for Sensor Counts 11 to 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate direction estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging the deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this redundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of sensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem, with prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten sensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for array sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive search algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating the search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was validated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations, confirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable to failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal configurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the potential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given sufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the state-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search methodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array configuration optimization.</description>

      <title>Waterfilling at the Edge: Optimal Percentile Resource Allocation via Risk-Averse Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address deterministic resource allocation in point-to-point multi-terminal AWGN channels without inter-terminal interference, with particular focus on optimizing quantile transmission rates for cell-edge terminal service. Classical utility-based approaches -- such as minimum rate, sumrate, and proportional fairness -- are either overconservative, or inappropriate, or do not provide a rigorous and/or interpretable foundation for fair rate optimization at the edge. To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its equivalence with the sum-least-$\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\alpha$Q) utility. This connection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\alpha$Q maximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and interpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian duality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions for the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as the associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel inexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine globally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its convergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and efficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate fairness across (cell-edge) terminals. Several (even large-scale) numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enabling robust quantile rate optimization at the edge.</description>

      <title>Dual RIS-Assisted Monostatic L-Band Radar Target Detection in NLoS Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of a single Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) to boost the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the radar offers significant improvement in detecting targets, especially in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. However, there are scenarios where no path exists between the radar and the target, even with a single RIS-assisted radar, due to other present obstacles. This paper derives an expression for SNR in target detection scenarios where dual RISs assist a monostatic radar in NLoS situations. We calculate the power received at the radar through a dual RIS configuration. We show that the SNR performance of RIS-assisted radars can improve with known locations of the radar and RISs. Our results demonstrate that the required accuracy in target localization can be achieved by controlling the number of RISs, the number of unit cells in each RIS, and properly selecting the locations of RISs to cover the desired region. The performance of dual RIS-assisted radar systems can surpass that of single RIS-assisted radar systems under favourable alignment and sufficiently large RIS sizes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fluid Antenna Configurations for Constructive Interference Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) has emerged as a new physical-layer concept to provide enhanced propagation conditions for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications over conventional fixed arrays. This work focuses on minimizing the maximum symbol error probability (SEP) under $M$-ary phase shift keying (MPSK) signaling in a multiuser downlink equipped with FAS, where each antenna moves within nonoverlapping intervals. This specific problem of joint SEP minimization with FAS and constructive interference (CI) precoding has not been previously addressed. The resulting problem turns out to be a nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization challenge. We transform the SEP minimization problem into a safety margin maximization problem in constructive interference precoding. Then, we customize a smoothing technique and a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm, with emphasis on low computational complexity. Simulation results show that our approach can reduce bit error rate (BER) compared to both the fixed arrays and FAS designed by existing particle swarm optimization (PSO). Also, our approach shows attractively low computational complexity compared to PSO benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Aware Secure Integrated Sensing and Communications with Fractional Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel secure integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system designed to serve multiple communication users (CUs) and targets. To that end, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the secrecy rate under constraints balancing both communication and sensing requirements. To enhance fairness among users, an entropy-regularized fairness metric is introduced within the problem framework. We then propose a solution employing an accelerated quadratic transform (QT) with a non-homogeneous bound to iteratively solve two subproblems, thereby effectively optimizing the overall objective. This approach ensures robust security and fairness in resource allocation for ISAC systems. Finally, simulation results verify the performance gains in terms of average secrecy rate, average data rate, and beam gain.</description>

      <title>Fast and Efficient Implementation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the Linear Regression with Gaussian Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear regression model with a random variable (RV) measurement matrix, where the mean of the random measurement matrix has full column rank, has been extensively studied. In particular, the quasiconvexity of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem was established, and the corresponding Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) was derived, leading to the development of an efficient bisection-based algorithm known as RV-ML. In contrast, this work extends the analysis to both overdetermined and underdetermined cases, allowing the mean of the random measurement matrix to be rank-deficient. A remarkable contribution is the proof that the equivalent MLE problem is convex and satisfies strong duality, strengthening previous quasiconvexity results. Moreover, it is shown that in underdetermined scenarios, the randomness in the measurement matrix can be beneficial for estimation under certain conditions. In addition, a fast and unified implementation of the MLE solution, referred to as generalized RV-ML (GRV-ML), is proposed, which handles a more general case including both underdetermined and overdetermined systems. Extensive numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Sensing Accuracy Optimization for Multi-UAV SAR Interferometry with Data Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with radar imaging sensors has revolutionized the monitoring of dynamic and local Earth surface processes by enabling high-resolution and cost-effective remote sensing. This paper investigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed to perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) sensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic aperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct angles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However, multi-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions from different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of the DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the ground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground station (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground backhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by minimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring sensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV formation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized using evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against established optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated annealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed solution outperforms these baseline schemes and achieves sub-decimeter vertical accuracy in several scenarios. These findings underline the potential of coordinated UAV swarms for delivering high-precision and real-time Earth observations through radar interferometry.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression Codes exploit Multi-User Diversity without CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sparse regression codes (SPARC) for multiple access channels with multiple receive antennas, in non-coherent flat fading channels. We propose a novel practical decoder, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit (MLMP), which greedily finds the support of the codewords of users with partial maximum likelihood metrics. As opposed to the conventional successive-cancellation based greedy algorithms, MLMP works as a successive-combining energy detector. We also propose MLMP modifications to improve the performance at high code rates. Our studies in short block lengths show that, even without any channel state information, SPARC with MLMP decoder achieves multi-user diversity in some scenarios, giving better error performance with multiple users than that of the corresponding single-user case. We also show that SPARC with MLMP performs better than conventional sparse recovery algorithms and pilot-aided transmissions with polar codes.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Reflecting-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Aided Communications Under CSI Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&amp;B has low computational complexity on average.</description>

      <title>Tool-to-Tool Matching Analysis Based Difference Score Computation Methods for Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line. Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting, where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves a correlation coefficient &gt;0.95 and &gt;0.5 with the variance and number of modes, respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient &gt;0.75 with the top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm hyper-parameters.</description>

      <title>Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such, digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other components, are not considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>Contrastive-KAN: A Semi-Supervised Intrusion Detection Framework for Cybersecurity with scarce Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, cybersecurity and intrusion detection systems are vital for the secure and reliable operation of IoT and IIoT environments. A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of labeled cyber-attack data, as most industrial systems operate under normal conditions. This data imbalance, combined with the high cost of annotation, hinders the effective training of machine learning models. Moreover, rapid detection of attacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent large-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time intrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). Our method leverages abundant unlabeled data to distinguish between normal and attack behaviors effectively. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, BoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20 percent, 1.28 percent, and 8 percent of labeled samples, respectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We further compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and robustness under limited supervision. KAN's ability to model complex relationships and its learnable activation functions are also explored and visualized, offering interpretability and potential for rule extraction. The method supports multi-class classification and proves effective in safety-critical environments where reliability is paramount.</description>

      <title>Time-series forecasting for nonlinear high-dimensional system using hybrid method combining autoencoder and multi-parallelized quantum long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A time-series forecasting method for high-dimensional spatial data is proposed. The method involves optimal selection of sparse sensor positions to efficiently represent the spatial domain, time-series forecasting at these positions, and estimation of the entire spatial distribution from the forecasted values via a learned decoder. Sensor positions are selected using a method based on combinatorial optimization. Introducing multi-parallelized quantum long short-term memory (MP-QLSTM) and gated recurrent unit (MP-QGRU) improves time-series forecasting performance by extending QLSTM models using the same number of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) as the cell state dimensions. Unlike the original QLSTM, our method fully measures all qubits in each VQC, maximizing the representation capacity. MP-QLSTM and MP-QGRU achieve approximately 1.5% lower test loss than classical LSTM and GRU. The root mean squared percentage error of MP-QLSTM is 0.256% against the values measured independently using semiconductor pressure sensors, demonstrating the method's accuracy and effectiveness for high-dimensional forecasting tasks.</description>

      <title>Commuting Distance Regularization for Timescale-Dependent Label Inconsistency in EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency. Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS), which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.</description>

      <title>Array-Aware Ambisonics and HRTF Encoding for Binaural Reproduction With Wearable Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary microphone arrays, based on array-aware optimization of Ambisonics encoding through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and head rotations compared to conventional Ambisonics encoding method. A listening experiment further confirms that the method achieves significantly higher perceptual ratings in both timbre and spatial quality. Fully compatible with standard Ambisonics, the proposed method offers a practical solution for spatial audio rendering in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable audio capture.</description>

      <title>FasTUSS: Faster Task-Aware Unified Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-Frequency (TF) dual-path models are currently among the best performing audio source separation network architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speech enhancement, music source separation, and cinematic audio source separation. While they are characterized by a relatively low parameter count, they still require a considerable number of operations, implying a higher execution time. This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger models trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as the recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model. TUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single, conditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining convolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a sequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be extracted. In this paper, we analyze the design choices of TUSS with the goal of optimizing its performance-complexity trade-off. We derive two more efficient models, FasTUSS-8.3G and FasTUSS-11.7G that reduce the original model's operations by 81\% and 73\% with minor performance drops of 1.2~dB and 0.4~dB averaged over all benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the impact of prompt conditioning to derive a causal TUSS model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Gaussian Noise Model of the nonlinear noise power spectral density is developed for a semiconductor optical amplifier as described by the Agrawal model. A simple closed-form expression is obtained for the nonlinear noise-to-signal ratio of broadband wavelength-division multiplexed signals as a function of the Agrawal model parameters, the amplifier output power and the transmission bandwidth. The accuracy of the closed-form expression and its region of validity is assessed in numerical simulations. The error is smaller than 0.1 dB when the product of bandwidth and gain recovery time $B\times\tau_c$ exceeds 100.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality Analysis in LoRa Uplink Satellite Communications Affected by Doppler Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides, for the first time, analytical expressions for the Long-Range (LoRa) waveform and cross-correlation in both continuous and discrete time domains under the Doppler effect in satellite communication. We propose the concept and formulas of the shared visibility window for satellites toward two ground devices. Our analysis covers cross-correlation results with varying spreading factors (SF) for no-Doppler and with-Doppler cases. We find the maximum cross-correlation with different SFs and the mean cross-correlation are immune to the Doppler effect. However, the maximum cross-correlation with the same SFs is only immune to high Doppler shift, with its value fluctuating between 0.6 and 1 under high Doppler rate. We interpret this fluctuation by introducing the relationship between transmission start time and cross-correlation. We provide a parameter analysis for orbit height, ground device distance, and inclination angle. Additionally, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) for LoRa signals and observe worse performance under high Doppler shift or interference with same SF. Increasing the SNR or the SIR improves the BER only when Doppler effect is below a frequency threshold. Notably, under Doppler effect, the performance behaviors of BER no longer align with those of maximum cross-correlation. Finally, our results lead to two recommendations: 1) To mitigate Doppler impact on cross-correlation, we recommend utilizing low SFs, high orbit height, short ground device distance, and the transmission start time with high Doppler shift; 2) To mitigate Doppler impact on BER, we recommend employing low SFs, high bandwidth, and transmission start time with high Doppler rate. These conflicting recommendations regarding transmission start time highlight the necessity of Doppler shift compensation techniques to help operate LoRa in space properly.</description>

      <title>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00486v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and precision loss, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tunnel diodes have traditionally been researched for extending backscatter read-ranges for ultra-high-frequency (UHF) radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags as reflection amplifiers. This paper explores the natural harmonics that arise from biasing these diodes within their negative differential resistance regions and with no interrogating signal from a transmitting source, such as an RFID reader, to injection-lock these diodes. These harmonics are characterized for five tunnel diode boards, made with the same components and with each board's fundamental frequencies measuring at above -15 dBm at a biasing voltage of 200 mV when measured over-the-cable. The occurrence of these harmonics creates unique harmonic signatures for each board and demonstrates possible harmonic RFID applications that can help RFID readers discover and even identify RFID tags with backscatter-less and memory-less IDs generated by tunnel diodes.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback for Wi-Fi Systems With Temporal Correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To achieve higher throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi systems, a station (STA) needs to efficiently compress channel state information (CSI) and feed it back to an access point (AP). In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based CSI feedback framework tailored for next-generation Wi-Fi systems. Our framework incorporates a pair of encoder and decoder neural networks to compress and reconstruct the angle parameters of the CSI. To enable an efficient finite-bit representation of the encoder output, we introduce a trainable vector quantization module, which is integrated after the encoder network and jointly trained with both the encoder and decoder networks in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we further enhance our framework by leveraging the temporal correlation of the angle parameters. Specifically, we propose an angle-difference feedback strategy which transmits the difference between the current and previous angle parameters when the difference is sufficiently small. This strategy accounts for the periodicity of the angle parameters through proper preprocessing and mitigates error propagation effects using novel feedback methods. We also introduce a DL-based CSI refinement module for the AP, which improves the reconstruction accuracy of the angle parameters by simultaneously utilizing both the previous and current feedback information. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms the standard method employed in current Wi-Fi systems. Our results also demonstrate significant performance gains achieved by the angle-difference feedback strategy and the CSI refinement module.</description>

      <title>Compute SNR-Optimal Analog-to-Digital Converters for Analog In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) is an energy-efficient alternative to digital architectures for accelerating machine learning and signal processing workloads. However, its energy efficiency is limited by the high energy cost of the column analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Reducing the ADC precision is an effective approach to lowering its energy cost. However, doing so also reduces the AIMC's computational accuracy thereby making it critical to identify the minimum precision required to meet a target accuracy. Prior works overestimate the ADC precision requirements by modeling quantization error as input-independent noise, maximizing the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR), and ignoring the discrete nature of ideal pre-ADC signal. We address these limitations by developing analytical expressions for estimating the compute signal-to-noise ratio (CSNR), a true metric of accuracy for AIMCs, and propose CACTUS, an algorithm to obtain CSNR-optimal ADC parameters. Using a circuit-aware behavioral model of an SRAM-based AIMC in a 28nm CMOS process, we show that for a 256-dimensional binary dot product, CACTUS reduces the ADC precision requirements by 3b while achieving 6dB higher CSNR over prior methods. We also delineate operating conditions under which our proposed CSNR-optimal ADCs outperform conventional SQNR-optimal ADCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design, development, and experimental validation of BlueME, a compact magnetoelectric (ME) antenna array system for underwater robot-to-robot communication. BlueME employs ME antennas operating at their natural mechanical resonance frequency to efficiently transmit and receive very-low-frequency (VLF) electromagnetic signals underwater. We outline the design, simulation, fabrication, and integration of the proposed system on low-power embedded platforms focusing on portable and scalable applications. For performance evaluation, we deployed BlueME on an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in open-water field trials. Our tests demonstrate that BlueME maintains reliable signal transmission at distances beyond 200 meters while consuming only 1 watt of power. Field trials show that the system operates effectively in challenging underwater conditions such as turbidity, obstacles, and multipath interference -- that generally affect acoustics and optics. Our analysis also examines the impact of complete submersion on system performance and identifies key deployment considerations. This work represents the first practical underwater deployment of ME antennas outside the laboratory, and implements the largest VLF ME array system to date. BlueME demonstrates significant potential for marine robotics and automation in multi-robot cooperative systems and remote sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Radar Signal Recognition through Self-Supervised Learning and Radio Frequency Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated radio frequency (RF) data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to perform few-shot RSR and enhance performance in environments with limited RF samples and annotations. We propose a two-step approach, first pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from diverse RF domains, and then transferring the learned representations to the radar domain, where annotated data are scarce. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet1D model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without using SSL. We also present reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.</description>

      <title>SIC-Free Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Constellation-Constrained Optimization and Application to Large-Scale Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems, SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness among users. To apply the proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in both weighted sum-rate and max-min fairness in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a viable option for future implementations.</description>

      <title>Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</description>

      <title>AoI-Energy-Spectrum Optimization in Post-Disaster Powered Communication Intelligent Network via Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper designs a post-disaster powered communication intelligent network (PDPCIN) to address communication disruptions caused by ground base station (GBS) failures within the post-disaster area. PDPCIN employs unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide wireless data collection (WDC) and wireless energy transmission (WET) for affected areas and leverages low earth orbit satellites (LEO SATs) to relay UAV data to the nearest survival GBS. To ensure basic post-disaster communication while co-optimizing age of information (AoI), energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency, intelligent synchronization-UAV (IS-UAV) architecture, AoI-based four thresholds updating (AFTU) mechanism, and Dynamic multi-LEO access (DMLA) strategy are proposed. However, three key challenges remain: time-varying task-resource imbalances, complex topology caused by multi-device scheduling, and nonlinear coupling in multidimensional metric optimization, making system optimization NP-hard. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical heterogeneous graph neural networks (HHGNN) framework. It models heterogeneous device nodes and their communication relations as a hierarchical heterogeneous graph structure, integrating our defined graph sensing, exchange, and mask layer to handle the network's input, feature propagation, and output. To search appropriate number of single-LEO SATs, we propose single-LEO SAT density optimization (S-LSDO) algorithm. Finally, we compare the proposed scheme with state-of-the-art benchmarks to validate its superior collaborative optimization of AoI, energy efficiency, and spectrum efficiency. Based on this, we derive the expressions for the expected values of AoI and stagnant AoI proportion.</description>
