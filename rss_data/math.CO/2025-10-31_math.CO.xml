      <title>Double sums involving binomial coefficients and special numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find an elementary approach for double sums where the inner sum is binomial but incomplete. We apply our core identity and its relatives to double sums involving famous numbers such as harmonic numbers, Fibonacci numbers, Stirling numbers and $r$-Stirling numbers of the second kind.</description>

      <title>On the Mutual Visibility of Some Moore Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of mutual visibility in a graph encodes combinatorial information about vertex subsets with prescribed visibility properties and serves as a useful algebraic invariant. In this paper, we study the visibility properties of some Moore graphs of diameter 2, with emphasis on the Petersen and Hoffman Singleton graphs. We first compute the visibility polynomial of the Petersen graph explicitly by analyzing its structural features in relation to the strong regularity of the graph. For the Hoffman Singleton graph, we establish an upper bound of 20 on its visibility number, and subsequently employ an integer programming approach to prove that this bound is tight. As a corollary, we deduce that the maximum size of an induced matching in the Hoffman Singleton graph is 10. These results demonstrate how visibility polynomials can be computed for extremal graphs of high symmetry, and how algebraic and optimization techniques can be combined to determine precise visibility parameters in complex graph families.</description>

      <title>Chip-Firing and the Sandpile Group of the $R_{10}$ Matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Seymour is that all regular matroids are built up from graphic matroids, cographic matroids, and a specific 10 element rank 5 matroid called $R_{10}$. In this article, we give a simple description of chip-firing on $R_{10}$ using complex numbers on the vertices of a pentagon, and link to an app where readers can play around with the combinatorial dynamics of the system. We also provide an easy to describe set of representatives for each of the 162 equivalence classes that make up the sandpile group of $R_{10}$.</description>

      <title>The Strong Birthday Problem Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Strong Birthday Problem (SBP) introduced in [1]. The problem is stated as follows: what is the minimum number of people we have to choose so that everyone has a shared birthday with probability at least 1/2? We derive recurrence relations to compute the probability, and further show a nice connection to the associated Stirling numbers of the second kind to derive additional recurrences. We implement the recurrences using dynamic programming as well as compute the values using the combinatorial formula, and provide numerical results.</description>

      <title>Variance vs. range for linear extensions, and balancing extensions in posets of bounded width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An old conjecture of Kahn and Saks says, roughly, that any poset $P$ of large enough width contains elements $x,y$ which are "balanced" in the sense that the probability that $x$ precedes $y$ in a uniformly random linear extension of $P$ is close to $1/2$. We show this implies the seemingly stronger statement that the same conclusion holds if, instead of large width, we assume only that, for some $x$, the number, $\pi(x)$, of elements of $P$ incomparable to $x$ is large. The implication follows from our two main results: first, that if $\pi(P):=\max \pi(x)$ is large then $P$ has large variance, i.e. there is a $y$ whose position in a uniform extension of $P$ has large variance; and second, that the conclusion of the Kahn-Saks Conjecture holds for $P$ with large variance and bounded width. These two assertions also yield an easy proof of a (not easy) result of Chan, Pak and Panova on "sorting probabilities" for Young diagrams, together with its natural generalization to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of pattern-avoiding $(0,1)$-matrices and their symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Brualdi and Cao studied $I_k$-avoiding $(0,1)$-matrices by decomposing them into zigzag paths and proved that the maximum number of $1$'s in such a matrix is given by an exact number. We further study the structure of maximal $I_k$-avoiding $(0,1)$-matrices (IAMs) by interpreting them as families of non-intersecting lattice paths on the square lattice. Using this perspective, we establish a bijection showing that IAMs are equinumerous with plane partitions of a certain size. Moreover, we classify all ten symmetry classes of IAMs under the action of the dihedral group of order $8$ and show that the enumeration formulas for these classes are given by simple product formulas. Extending this approach to skew shapes, we derive a conceptual formula for enumerating maximal $I_k$-avoiding $(0,1)$-fillings of skew shapes.</description>

      <title>Minimum spectral radius of graphs of fixed order and dissociation number and its connection to Tur\'an problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}_{n,\tau}$ be the set of all simple connected graphs of order $n$ and dissociation number $\tau.$ In this paper, we study the minimum size and the minimum spectral radius of graphs in $\mathcal{D}_{n,\tau}$ in connection with Tur\'an-type problems for complete multipartite graphs. We characterize the Tur\' an graphs for several complete multipartite graphs where the size of one of the partite sets is much smaller than the size of the remaining partites. This extends a result of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits [16]. Additionally, we prove some stability results to get the structure of graphs without such a forbidden complete multipartite subgraph, and close to Tur\'an number of edges. As an application, we show that a graph with the minimum spectral radius in $\mathcal{D}_{n,\tau}$ must be a graph with the minimum size in $\mathcal{D}_{n, \tau}$ when $n$ is sufficiently large and satisfies some parity conditions. We then describe a few structural properties of graphs with the minimum spectral radius in $\mathcal{D}_{n,\tau}$. For even dissociation numbers and any order $n$, we compute the minimum size of a graph in $\mathcal{D}_{n,\tau}$ and use it to characterize the graphs in $\mathcal{D}_{n, 4}$ that attain the minimum size and the minimum spectral radius. We also apply the stability results to upper bound the minimum number of edges and spectral radius for connected graphs with a given $d$-independence number when the order of the graph is sufficiently large. Finally, we derive two new bounds on the value of $\tau(G)$ for a given graph $G$.</description>

      <title>The Morse complex of the wedge of two extended star graphs and a path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the work of C. Donovan and N. A. Scoville, the homotopy type of the Morse complex of the extended star graph which is obtained as the one-point union of n paths of length 2 was determined by using star clusters and Cluster Lemma. In this paper, we determine the homotopy type of the Morse complex of extended star graph consisting of a path of length 1 and n paths of length 2 by using strong collapses and Hasse diagram. Furthermore, we compute the homotopy type of the graph obtained by attaching the center vertices of two extended star graphs to different endpoints of a path by using star clusters and the Cluster Lemma.</description>

      <title>The circumference of a graph with given minimum degree and clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumference denoted by $c(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the length of its longest cycle. Let $\delta(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the minimum degree and the clique number of a graph $G$, respectively. In [\emph{Electron. J. Combin.} 31(4)(2024) $\#$P4.65], Yuan proved that if $G$ is a 2-connected graph of order $n$, then $c(G)\geq \min\{n,\omega(G)+\delta(G)\}$ unless $G$ is one of two specific graphs. In this paper, we prove a stability result for the theorem of Erd\H os and Gallai, thereby helping us to characterize all $2$-connected non-hamiltonian graphs whose circumference equals the sum of their clique number and minimum degree. Combining this with Yuan's result, one can deduce that if $G$ is a $2$-connected graph of order $n$, then $c(G)\geq \min\{n,\omega(G)+\delta(G)+1\}$, unless $G$ belongs to certain specified graph classes.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for a digraph to contain: a pre-Hamiltonian cycle and cycles of lengths 3 and 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a digraph of order $p\geq5$ with minimum degree at least $p-1$ and with minimum semi-degree at least $p/2-1$.
  In his excellent and renowned paper, ``Long Cycles in Digraphs" (Proc. London Mathematical Society (3), 42 (1981), Thomassen fully characterized the following for $p=2n+1$: (i) $D$ has a cycle of length at least $2n$; and (ii) $D$ is Hamiltonian. Motivated by this result, and building on some of the ideas in Thomassen's paper, we investigated the Hamiltonicity (when $p$ is even) and pancyclcity (when $p$ is arbitrary) such digraphs. We have given a complete description of whether such digraphs are Hamiltonian ($p$ is even), are pancyclic ($p$ is arbitrary). Since the proof is very long, we have divided it into three parts.
  In this paper, we provide a full description of the following: (iii) for $k=3$ and $k=4$, the digraph $D$ contains a cycle of length $k$; and (iv) the digraph $D$ contains a pre-Hamiltonian cycle, i.e. a cycle of length $p-1$.</description>

      <title>Additive structures imply more distances in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a set $E \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q^d$, the distance set is defined as $\Delta(E) := \{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}\| : \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y} \in E\}$, where $\|\cdot\|$ denotes the standard quadratic form. We investigate the Erd\H{o}s--Falconer distance problem within the flexible class of $(u, s)$--Salem sets introduced by Fraser, with emphasis on the even case $u = 4$. By exploiting the exact identity between $\|\widehat{E}\|_4$ and the fourth additive energy $\Lambda_4(E)$, we prove that quantitative gains in $\Lambda_4(E)$ force the existence of many distances.
  In particular, for a $(4, s)$--Salem set $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $d \geq 2$, we prove that if \[ |E|\gg q^{\min\left\{\frac{d+2}{4s+1}, \frac{d+4}{8s}\right\}}, \] then $E$ determines a positive proportion of all distances. This strictly improves Fraser's threshold of $\frac{d}{4s}$ and the Iosevich-Rudnev bound of $q^{\frac{d+1}{2}}$ in certain parameter ranges. As applications, we obtain improved thresholds for multiplicative subgroups and sets on arbitrary varieties, and establish a sharp incidence bound for Salem sets that is of independent interest in incidence geometry. We also propose a unified conjecture for $(4, s)$--Salem sets that reconciles known bounds and pinpoints the odd-dimensional sphere regime: in odd dimensions $d \geq 3$, the often-cited $\frac{d-1}{2}$ threshold does not follow without additional structure, while on primitive-radius spheres, any $q^{-\epsilon/2}$-gain in the fourth energy improves the standing threshold of $\frac{d}{2}$. This provides a new approach to address this problem.</description>

      <title>A new spectral Tur\'an theorem for weighted graphs and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confirming a conjecture of Elphick and Edwards and strengthening a spectral theorem of Wilf, Nikiforov proved that for any $K_{r+1}$-free graph $G$, $\lambda(G)^2 \leq 2 (1 - 1/r) m$, where $\lambda(G)$ is the spectral radius of $G$, and $m$ is the number of edges of $G$. This result was later improved in \cite{LiuN26}, where it was shown that for any graph $G$, $\lambda(G)^2 \leq 2 \sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{\mathrm{cl}(e) - 1}{\mathrm{cl}(e)}$, where $\mathrm{cl}(e)$ denotes the order of the largest clique containing the edge $e$.
  In this paper, we further extend this inequality to weighted graphs, proving that \[ \lambda(G)^2 \leq 2 \sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{\mathrm{cl}(e) - 1}{\mathrm{cl}(e)} w(e)^2, \] and we characterize all extremal graphs attaining this bound. Our main theorem yields several new consequences, including two vertex-based and vertex-degree-based local versions of Tur\'an's theorem, as well as weighted generalizations of the Edwards--Elphick theorem and the Cvetkovi\'c theorem, and localized versions of Wilf's two theorems. Moreover, the result unifies and implies numerous earlier ones from spectral graph theory and extremal graph theory, including Stanley's spectral inequality, Hong's inequality, a localized Tur\'an-type theorem, and a recent extremal theorem by Adak and Chandran. Notably, while Nikiforov's earlier spectral inequality implied Stanley's bound, it did not imply Hong's inequality -- a gap that is now bridged by our result. As a key tool, we establish the inequality $\sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{2}{\mathrm{cl}(e)} \geq n-1$, which complements an upper bound $\sum_{e \in E(G)} \frac{2}{\mathrm{cl}(e)-1} \leq n^2 - 2m$ due to Brada\v{c}, and Malec and Tompkins, independently.</description>

      <title>Bijections Between Smirnov Words and Hamiltonian Cycles in Complete Multipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a bijective correspondence between Smirnov words with balanced letter multiplicities and Hamiltonian paths in complete $m$-partite graphs $K_{n,n,\ldots,n}$. This bijection allows us to derive closed inclusion-exclusion formulas for the number of Hamiltonian cycles in such graphs. We further extend the enumeration to the generalized nonuniform case $K_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_m}$. We also provide an asymptotic analysis based on Stirling's approximation, which yields compact factorial expressions and logarithmic expansions describing the growth of the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the considered graphs. Our approach unifies the combinatorial study of adjacency-constrained words and the enumeration of Hamiltonian cycles within a single analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Tokushige's conjecture on measures of cross $t$-intersecting families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the product measure version (also known as the $p$-weight version) of intersection problems in extremal combinatorics. Firstly, we prove that for any \(n \geq t \geq 3\) and \(p_1, p_2 \in (0, \frac{1}{t+1})\), if \(\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq 2^{[n]}\) are cross \(t\)-intersecting families, then $\mu_{p_1}(\mathcal{F}_1)\mu_{p_2}(\mathcal{F}_2)\le (p_1p_2)^t$. This resolves a conjecture of Tokushige for \(t \geq 3\). Secondly, we study the intersection problems for integer sequences and prove that if $\mathcal{H}_1, \mathcal{H}_2 \subseteq [m]^{n}$ are cross $t$-intersecting with \(m &gt; t+1\), then $|\mathcal{H}_1|| \mathcal{H}_2|\leq (m^{n-t})^2$. This confirms another conjecture of Tokushige for \(m &gt; t+1\). As an application, we strengthen a recent theorem of Frankl and Kupavskii, generalizing the well-known IU-Theorem. Finally, we show that if \(p \geq \frac{1}{2}\) and $ \mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subseteq 2^{[n]}$ are cross $t$-intersecting families, then $\min \left\{\mu_{p}(\mathcal{F}_1),\mu_{p}(\mathcal{F}_2)\right\} \leq \mu_{p}(\mathcal{K}(n,t))$, where $\mathcal{K}(n,t)$ denotes the Katona family. This recovers an old result of Ahlswede and Katona.</description>

      <title>Heilbronn's triangle problem in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that among any $n$ points in the unit cube one can find a triangle of area at most $n^{-2/3-c}$ for some absolute constant $c &gt;0$. This gives the first non-trivial upper bound for the three-dimensional version of Heilbronn's triangle problem. This estimate is a consequence of the following result about configurations of point-line pairs in $\mathbb R^3$: for $n \ge 2$ let $p_1, \ldots,p_n \in [0,1]^3$ be a collection of points and let $\ell_i$ be a line through $p_i$ for every $i$ such that $d(p_i, \ell_j) \ge \delta$ for all $i\neq j$. Then we have $n \lesssim \delta^{-3+\gamma}$ for some absolute constant $\gamma&gt;0$. The analogous result about point-line configurations in the plane was previously established by Cohen, Pohoata and the last author.</description>

      <title>Directed distances in bipolar-oriented triangulations: exact exponents and scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study longest and shortest directed paths in the following natural model of directed random planar maps: the uniform infinite bipolar-oriented triangulation (UIBOT), which is the local limit of uniform bipolar-oriented triangulations around a typical edge. We construct the Busemann function which measures directed distance to $\infty$ along a natural interface in the UIBOT. We show that in the case of longest (resp.\ shortest) directed paths, this Busemann function converges in the scaling limit to a $2/3$-stable L\'evy process (resp.\ a $4/3$-stable L\'evy process).
  We also prove up-to-constants bounds for directed distances in finite bipolar-oriented triangulations sampled from a Boltzmann distribution, and for size-$n$ cells in the UIBOT. These bounds imply that in a typical subset of the UIBOT with $n$ edges, longest directed path lengths are of order $n^{3/4}$ and shortest directed path lengths are of order $n^{3/8}$. These results give the scaling dimensions for discretizations of the (hypothetical) $\sqrt{4/3}$-directed Liouville quantum gravity metrics.
  The main external input in our proof is the bijection of Kenyon-Miller-Sheffield-Wilson (2015). We do not use any continuum theory. We expect that our techniques can also be applied to prove similar results for directed distances in other random planar map models and for longest increasing subsequences in pattern-avoiding permutations.</description>

      <title>Strict monotonicity of critical points in independent long-range percolation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider independent long-range percolation models on locally finite vertex-transitive graphs. Using coupling ideas we prove strict monotonicity of the critical points with respect to local perturbations in the connection function, thereby improving upon previous results obtained via the classical essential enhancement method of Aizenman and Grimmett in several ways. In particular, our approach allows us to work under minimal assumptions, namely shift-invariance and summability of the connection function, and it applies to both undirected and directed bond percolation models.</description>

      <title>Conditioning random points by the number of vertices of their convex hull: the bi-pointed case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pick $N$ random points $U_1,\cdots,U_{N}$ independently and uniformly in a triangle ABC with area 1, and take the convex hull of the set $\{A,B,U_1,\cdots,U_{N}\}$. The boundary of this convex hull is a convex chain $V_0=B,V_1,\cdots,$ $V_{\mathbf{n}(N)}$, $V_{\mathbf{n}(N)+1}=A$ with random size $\mathbf{n}(N)$. The first aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of this chain, conditional on $\mathbf{n}(N)=n$, when both $n$ and $m=N-n$ go to $+\infty$. We prove a phase transition: if $m=\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor$ where $\lambda&gt;0$, this chain converges in probability for the Hausdorff topology to an (explicit) hyperbola ${\cal H}_\lambda$ as $n\to+\infty$, while, if $m=o(n)$, the limit shape is a parabola. We prove that this hyperbola is solution to an optimization problem: among all concave curves ${\cal C}$ in $ABC$ (incident with $A$ and $B$), ${\cal H}_\lambda$ is the unique curve maximizing the functional ${\cal C}\mapsto {\sf Area}({\cal C})^{\lambda} {\sf L}({\cal C})^3$ where ${\sf L}({\cal C})$ is the affine perimeter of ${\cal C}$. We also give the logarithm expansion of the probability ${\bf Q}^{\triangle \bullet\bullet}_{n,\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor}$, that $\mathbf{n}(N)=n$ when $N=n+\lfloor n\lambda\rfloor$.
  Take a compact convex set $\mathbf{K}$ with area 1 in the plane, and denote by ${\bf Q}^{\mathbf{K}}_{n,m}$ the probability of the event that the convex hull of $n+m$ iid uniform points in $\mathbf{K}$ is a polygon with $n$ vertices.
  We provide some results and conjectures regarding the asymptotic logarithm expansion of ${\bf Q}^{\mathbf{K}}_{n,m}$, as well as results and conjectures concerning limit shape theorems, conditional on this event.
  These results and conjectures generalize B\'ar\'any's results, who treated the case $\lambda=0$.</description>

      <title>On the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canalization is a key organizing principle in complex systems, particularly in gene regulatory networks. It describes how certain input variables exert dominant control over a function's output, thereby imposing hierarchical structure and conferring robustness to perturbations. Degeneracy, in contrast, captures redundancy among input variables and reflects the complete dominance of some variables by others. Both properties influence the stability and dynamics of discrete dynamical systems, yet their combinatorial underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, we derive recursive formulas for counting Boolean functions with prescribed numbers of essential variables and given canalizing properties. In particular, we determine the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions -- that is, functions for which all variables are essential and at least one variable is canalizing. Our approach extends earlier enumeration results on canalizing and nested canalizing functions. It provides a rigorous foundation for quantifying how frequently canalization occurs among random Boolean functions and for assessing its pronounced over-representation in biological network models, where it contributes to both robustness and to the emergence of distinct regulatory roles.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fuss-Catalan thresholds in graph bootstrap percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graph bootstrap percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$. For all $r \ge 5$, we locate the sharp $K_r$-percolation threshold $p_c \sim (\gamma n)^{-1/\lambda}$, solving a problem of Balogh, Bollob\'as and Morris. The case $r=3$ is the classical graph connectivity threshold, and the threshold for $r=4$ was found using strong connections with the well-studied $2$-neighbor dynamics from statistical physics. When $r \ge 5$, such connections break down, and the process exhibits much richer behavior. The constants $\lambda=\lambda(r)$ and $\gamma=\gamma(r)$ in $p_c$ are determined by a class of $\left({r\choose2}-1\right)$-ary tree-like graphs, which we call $K_r$-tree witness graphs. These graphs are associated with the most efficient ways of adding a new edge in the $K_r$-dynamics, and they can be counted using the Fuss-Catalan numbers. Also, in the subcritical setting, we determine the asymptotic number of edges added to ${\mathcal G}_{n,p}$, showing that the edge density increases only by a constant factor, whose value we identify.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.06591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enumerate cubic (3-regular) unicellular maps on closed surfaces up to all homeomorphisms. Using the orbifold approach, we reduce the unsensed enumeration to explicit counts of quotient maps and rooted cubic/precubic maps on simpler surfaces. For orientable hosts this yields a compact identity expressed through known sensed and rooted numbers; for non orientable hosts we obtain a fully explicit finite sum expression via precubic counts. Numerical tables are provided, together with a brief asymptotic discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12843v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of $\mu$-signed and duplication signed graphs and shows that both are always structurally balanced. Using the duplication signed graph, we define the corona product of the duplication signed graph (Duplication add vertex corona product and duplication vertex corona product) and explore their structural properties. Additionally, we provide the adjacency spectrum of both the products for any $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, and the Laplacian and signless Laplacian spectrum for regular $\Gamma_1$ and arbitrary $\Gamma_2$, in terms of the corresponding spectrum of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. Finally, we discuss its application in generating integral and equienergetic signed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to a well-known result in geometric topology, we have \linebreak $\left (\mathbb{S}^2 \right)^{n}\!\!/\operatorname{Sym}(n) = \mathbb{CP}^{n}$, where $\operatorname{Sym}(n)$ acts on $\left (\mathbb{S}^2 \right)^{n}$ by coordinate permutation. We use this fact to explicitly construct a regular simplicial cell decomposition of $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ for each $n \geq 2$. In more detail, we start with the standard two triangle crystallisation $S^2_3$ of the $2$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, in its $n$-fold Cartesian product. We then construct a simplicial subdivision of this product and prove that the $\operatorname{Sym}(n)$ quotient of this subdivision yields a simplicial cell decomposition of $\mathbb{CP}^n$. The first derived subdivision of this cell complex is a simplicial triangulation of $\mathbb{CP}^n$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit description of triangulations of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ for $n \geq 4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new two-player game on graphs, in which players alternate choosing vertices until the set of chosen vertices forms a dominating set. The last player to choose a vertex is the winner. The game fits into the scheme of several other known games on graphs. We characterize the paths and cycles for which the first player has the winning strategy. We also create tools for combining graphs in various ways (via graph powers, Cartesian products, graph joins, and other methods) for building a variety of graphs whose games are won by the second player, including cubes, multidimensional grids with an odd number of vertices, most multidimensional toroidal grids, various trees such as specialized caterpillars, the Petersen graph, and others. Finally, we extend the game to groups and show that the second player wins the game on abelian groups of even order with canonical generating set, among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that any function $f$ from a finite set $Y$ to itself can be represented linearly. Specifically, we prove the existence of an injective map $j$ from $Y$ into a modular ring $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ and a constant $a \in \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ such that $j(f(y)) = a \cdot j(y)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$ holds for all $y \in Y$. This result is established by analyzing the algebraic properties of the adjugate of the characteristic matrix associated with the function's digraph. The proof is constructive, providing a method for finding the embedding $j$, the modulus $m$, and the linear multiplier $a$.</description>

      <title>Assignment-Routing Optimization : Efficient Heuristic Solver with Shaking Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper works on heuristic solver for joint assignment and routing optimization problem. Study on previous works shows that MIP based exact solvers can only provide efficient solutions for small to moderate size problems, due to exponentially growing computational complexity. This paper proposes to start with high quality initial guess through Hungarian algorithm based assignment and heuristic cycle merging algorithm. Subsequently, the solution is improved based on a proposed shaking algorithm to improve the assignment and routing sequence. In addition, the shaking approach also enables the Simulated Annealing algorithm to further improve the solution, which is very difficult if it is purely based on random sampling updates of item and placeholder sequences. Extensive experimental validation comparing with ground truth from the previously shared database shows that the introduced solver is much more efficient than the Gurobi solver especially for large size problems, with a 1000 node pair problem being solved within 1 min in Python implementation. The solution accuracy is within a percent in general as compared with ground truth in database. Although there are spaces for the proposed solver to be further improved with better accuracy, it works for practical applications with acceptable path quality and sufficient solver efficiency. Such shaking algorithms based solvers can also be applied to more general joint assignment and routing optimization problem with multiple type of items and corresponding placeholders.

While solving open problems they posed, Chen and Zhou derived a number of identities using analytic methods and asked for combinatorial proofs. In this note, we provide the requested combinatorial proofs. Additionally, we derive several new identities and provide combinatorial proofs for them.</description>

      <title>Rook placements and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</description>

      <title>Loop homology of moment-angle complexes in the flag case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18450v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general homological approach to presentations of connected graded associative algebras, and apply it to the loop homology of moment-angle complexes $Z_K$ that correspond to flag simplicial complexes $K$. For arbitrary coefficient ring, we describe generators of the Pontryagin algebra $H_*(\Omega Z_K)$ and defining relations between them. We prove that such moment-angle complexes are coformal over $\mathbb{Q},$ give a necessary condition for rational formality, and compute their homotopy groups in terms of homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <title>Smallest Suffixient Sets as a Repetitiveness Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suffixient set is a novel combinatorial object that captures the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper, we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations. As a corollary of our results, we give a simple online algorithm to compute smallest suffixient sets.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Constraints in Polyhedral Enclosure and Tetrahedral Decomposition in Genus-0 Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18222v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for determining whether a given set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter $S:=\sum_f(\tmop{deg} f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and $S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations $N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges for internally decomposed polyhedra with the minimal number of added internal edges. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian heat flows on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a semigroup framework for Laplacians on directed hypergraphs, extending the classical heat flow models on graphs and establishing hypergraphs as prototypical models for non-Markovian diffusion. We apply spectral surgery methods to derive eigenvalue bounds, thus describing large-time behaviour of the heat flow. Unlike on standard graphs, heat flows on directed hypergraphs may lose positivity and/or $\infty$-contractivity, yet can recover them eventually or asymptotically under specific combinatorial configurations: examples based on duals of oriented graph and realisations of the Fano plane illustrate these phenomena.
  Our approach combines combinatorial, order-theoretic and linear-algebraic methods.</description>
