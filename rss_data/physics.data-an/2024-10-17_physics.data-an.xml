      <title>Sparse flow reconstruction methods to reduce the costs of analyzing large unsteady datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cost of writing, transferring, and storing large data from unsteady simulations limits access to the entire solution, often leaving much of the flow under-sampled or unanalyzed. For example, modeling transient behavior of rare dynamic events requires 3D snapshots at high sampling rates over long periods, generating significant amounts of data and creating challenges for practical CFD workflows, especially with limited memory resources and costly GPU writing penalties. In this work, multiple sparse flow reconstruction (SFR) methods are developed to approximate a full unsteady solution using far fewer sparse measurements, thus reducing writing costs, data storage, and enabling higher sampling rates. SFR is motivated by a large-eddy simulation of rare inlet distortion events, demonstrating that down-sampling full snapshots and supplementing them with high-frequency sparse measurements can drastically cut writing time for GPU solvers and nearly eliminate this cost for CPU solvers. The simplest single-equation "snapshot" SFR method can be compressed further using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD-SFR) or a more efficient double POD-SFR variant. A streaming SFR modification improves reconstruction efficiency when local memory is limited. A sensitivity study evaluates trade-offs between sparse sampling rates and reconstruction accuracy, offering best practices. To offset error of using random sparse measurements, SFR exactly preserves dynamics in key regions by prescribing sparse measurement locations, used here to capture distortion events. Distortion events are evaluated using the conditional space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (CST-POD) to pursue physical insights that characterize the upstream causality at full resolution. A validation study of CST-POD modes confirms SFR effectiveness at retaining the event dynamics with substantial computational and memory savings.</description>

      <title>A general statistical approach to quantum algorithms in a circuit model based on the expectation and standard deviation of each gate separately</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a growing literature exploring the generalization of quantum algorithms, such that different quantum algorithms are special examples of a more fundamental structure. In this short paper, we provide a general approach to describe quantum algorithms as a quantum state with amplitudes that are constructed from the expected value and standard deviation of each quantum gate or a sub-sequence of gates in the algorithm. The proposed statistical-based description relies on the celebrated Aharonov-Vaidman identity. We present a more fundamental identity that, unlike the previous one, allows us to switch the basis of the states into a desired form.</description>

      <title>Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of $56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of $9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</description>

      <title>Control of Probability Flow in Markov Chain Monte Carlo -- Nonreversibility and Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is widely used in various fields as a powerful numerical integration technique for systems with many degrees of freedom. In MCMC methods, probabilistic state transitions can be considered as a random walk in state space, and random walks allow for sampling from complex distributions. However, paradoxically, it is necessary to carefully suppress the randomness of the random walk to improve computational efficiency. By breaking detailed balance, we can create a probability flow in the state space and perform more efficient sampling along this flow. Motivated by this idea, practical and efficient nonreversible MCMC methods have been developed over the past ten years. In particular, the lifting technique, which introduces probability flows in an extended state space, has been applied to various systems and has proven more efficient than conventional reversible updates. We review and discuss several practical approaches to implementing nonreversible MCMC methods, including the shift method in the cumulative distribution and the directed-worm algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sparks in the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel method for the definition of signal regions in searches for new physics at collider experiments, specifically those conducted at CERNs Large Hadron Collider. By leveraging multi-dimensional histograms with precise arithmetic and utilizing the SparkDensityTree library, it is possible to identify high-density regions within the available phase space, potentially improving sensitivity to very small signals. Inspired by an ongoing search for dark mesons at the ATLAS experiment, CMS open data is used for this proof-of-concept intentionally targeting an already excluded signal. Several signal regions are defined based on density estimates of signal and background. These preliminary regions align well with the physical properties of the signal while effectively rejecting background events. While not explored in this work, this method is also scalable, which makes it ideal for large datasets such as those expected at the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. Finally, this method is flexible and can be easily extended, promising a boost to the signal region definition process for new physics searches at colliders.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Diffuse Interstellar Bands at 5780, 5797, and 6614 {\AA} in Low-Resolution Spectra of Cool Stars from LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We attempt to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in over two million low-resolution spectra of cool stars from LAMOST. Based on the DIB measurements, the correlation between DIBs and extinction, the kinematics of DIBs, and the Galactic distribution of DIBs are reviewed and investigated from the perspective of statistics. A pipeline is developed to measure the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in the LAMOST low-resolution spectra. We obtain the DIB measurements of spectra of late-type stars from LAMOST, and screen out 176,831, 13,473 and 110,152 high-quality (HQ) measurements of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614, respectively, corresponding to 142,074, 11,480 and 85,301 unique sources. Utilizing these HQ measurements, we present the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern sky for the first time. The central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 in air are determined to be 5780.48 $\pm$ 0.01, 5796.94 $\pm$ 0.02 and 6613.64 $\pm$ 0.01 {\AA}, respectively, based on their kinematics. The equivalent widths of these three DIBs per unit extinction are statistically fitted to be 0.565, 0.176 and 0.256 {\AA}/mag. As a part of our work, three catalogs of the HQ measurements for the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are provided online. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest number of measurements of these three DIBs to date. It is also the first time that the Galactic maps of the DIBs $\lambda$5780 and $\lambda$6614 in the northern hemisphere are presented, and the central wavelengths of the DIBs $\lambda$5780, $\lambda$5797 and $\lambda$6614 are estimated from the kinematics.</description>
