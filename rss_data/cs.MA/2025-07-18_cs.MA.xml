      <title>On multiagent online problems with predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties and benchmark it.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Math Tutoring: Platform for Personalized and Adaptive Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement, current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured, individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and effective systems for teaching mathematics.</description>

      <title>MR-LDM -- The Merge-Reactive Longitudinal Decision Model: Game Theoretic Human Decision Modeling for Interactive Sim Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior, i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development.</description>

      <title>NLI4VolVis: Natural Language Interaction for Volume Visualization via LLM Multi-Agents and Editable 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional volume visualization (VolVis) methods, like direct volume rendering, suffer from rigid transfer function designs and high computational costs. Although novel view synthesis approaches enhance rendering efficiency, they require additional learning effort for non-experts and lack support for semantic-level interaction. To bridge this gap, we propose NLI4VolVis, an interactive system that enables users to explore, query, and edit volumetric scenes using natural language. NLI4VolVis integrates multi-view semantic segmentation and vision-language models to extract and understand semantic components in a scene. We introduce a multi-agent large language model architecture equipped with extensive function-calling tools to interpret user intents and execute visualization tasks. The agents leverage external tools and declarative VolVis commands to interact with the VolVis engine powered by 3D editable Gaussians, enabling open-vocabulary object querying, real-time scene editing, best-view selection, and 2D stylization. We validate our system through case studies and a user study, highlighting its improved accessibility and usability in volumetric data exploration. We strongly recommend readers check our case studies, demo video, and source code at https://nli4volvis.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Imitating Mistakes in a Learning Companion AI Agent for Online Peer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, peer learning has gained attention as a method that promotes spontaneous thinking among learners, and its effectiveness has been confirmed by numerous studies. This study aims to develop an AI Agent as a learning companion that enables peer learning anytime and anywhere. However, peer learning between humans has various limitations, and it is not always effective. Effective peer learning requires companions at the same proficiency levels. In this study, we assume that a learner's peers with the same proficiency level as the learner make the same mistakes as the learner does and focus on English composition as a specific example to validate this approach.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coral Protocol is an open and decentralized collaboration infrastructure that enables communication, coordination, trust and payments for The Internet of Agents. It addresses the growing need for interoperability in a world where organizations are deploying multiple specialized AI agents that must work together across domains and vendors. As a foundational platform for multi-agent AI ecosystems, Coral establishes a common language and coordination framework allowing any agent to participate in complex workflows with others. Its design emphasizes broad compatibility, security, and vendor neutrality, ensuring that agent interactions are efficient and trustworthy. In particular, Coral introduces standardized messaging formats for agent communication, a modular coordination mechanism for orchestrating multi-agent tasks, and secure team formation capabilities for dynamically assembling trusted groups of agents. Together, these innovations position Coral Protocol as a cornerstone of the emerging "Internet of Agents," unlocking new levels of automation, collective intelligence, and business value through open agent collaboration.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibrium seeking for a class of quadratic-bilinear Wasserstein distributionally robust games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Wasserstein distributionally robust Nash equilibrium problems, where agents construct heterogeneous data-driven Wasserstein ambiguity sets using private samples and radii, in line with their individual risk-averse behaviour. By leveraging relevant properties of this class of games, we show that equilibria of the original seemingly infinite-dimensional problem can be obtained as a solution to a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We then reformulate the problem as a finite-dimensional variational inequality and establish the connection between the corresponding solution sets. Our reformulation has scalable behaviour with respect to the data size and maintains a fixed number of constraints, independently of the number of samples. To compute a solution, we leverage two algorithms, based on the golden ratio algorithm. The efficiency of both algorithmic schemes is corroborated through extensive simulation studies on an illustrative example and a stochastic portfolio allocation game, where behavioural coupling among investors is modeled.</description>

      <title>Learning Policies for Dynamic Coalition Formation in Multi-Robot Task Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized, learning-based framework for dynamic coalition formation in Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Our approach extends MAPPO by integrating spatial action maps, robot motion planning, intention sharing, and task allocation revision to enable effective and adaptive coalition formation. Extensive simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of our model, enabling each robot to rely solely on local information to learn timely revisions of task selections and form coalitions with other robots to complete collaborative tasks. The results also highlight the proposed framework's ability to handle large robot populations and adapt to scenarios with diverse task sets.</description>
