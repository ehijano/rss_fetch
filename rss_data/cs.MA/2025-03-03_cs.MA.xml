      <title>Among Them: A game-based framework for assessing persuasion capabilities of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20426</link>

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents has raised concerns about their potential for automated persuasion and social influence. While existing research has explored isolated instances of LLM-based manipulation, systematic evaluations of persuasion capabilities across different models remain limited. In this paper, we present an Among Us-inspired game framework for assessing LLM deception skills in a controlled environment. The proposed framework makes it possible to compare LLM models by game statistics, as well as quantify in-game manipulation according to 25 persuasion strategies from social psychology and rhetoric. Experiments between 8 popular language models of different types and sizes demonstrate that all tested models exhibit persuasive capabilities, successfully employing 22 of the 25 anticipated techniques. We also find that larger models do not provide any persuasion advantage over smaller models and that longer model outputs are negatively correlated with the number of games won. Our study provides insights into the deception capabilities of LLMs, as well as tools and data for fostering future research on the topic.</description>

      <title>An Identity Based Agent Model for Value Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12159v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social identities play an important role in the dynamics of human societies, and it can be argued that some sense of identification with a larger cause or idea plays a critical role in making humans act responsibly. Often social activists strive to get populations to identify with some cause or notion -- like green energy, diversity, etc. in order to bring about desired social changes. We explore the problem of designing computational models for social identities in the context of autonomous AI agents. For this, we propose an agent model that enables agents to identify with certain notions and show how this affects collective outcomes. We also contrast between associations of identity with rational preferences. The proposed model is simulated in an application context of urban mobility, where we show how changes in social identity affect mobility patterns and collective outcomes.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large-Language-Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language model-driven autonomous agents have revealed that multi-agent collaboration often surpasses each individual through collective reasoning. Inspired by the neural scaling law--increasing neurons enhances performance, this study explores whether the continuous addition of collaborative agents can yield similar benefits. Technically, we utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents into a multi-agent collaboration network (MacNet), upon which their interactive reasoning is topologically orchestrated for autonomous task solving. Extensive evaluations reveal that it effectively supports collaboration among over a thousand agents, with irregular topologies outperforming regular ones. We also identify a collaborative scaling law--the overall performance follows a logistic growth pattern as agents scale, with collaborative emergence occurring earlier than traditional neural emergence. We speculate this may be because scaling agents catalyzes their multidimensional considerations during interactive reflection and refinement, thereby producing more comprehensive artifacts. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev/tree/macnet.</description>

      <title>Distributed Blind Source Separation based on FastICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), many traditional signal processing tasks are required to be computed in a distributed fashion, without transmissions of the raw data to a centralized processing unit, due to the limited energy and bandwidth resources available to the sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm, which aims at identifying the original signal sources based on observations of their mixtures measured at various sensor nodes. One of the most commonly used ICA algorithms is known as FastICA, which requires a spatial pre-whitening operation in the first step of the algorithm. Such a pre-whitening across all nodes of a WSN is impossible in a bandwidth-constrained distributed setting as it requires to correlate each channel with each other channel in the WSN. We show that an explicit network-wide pre-whitening step can be circumvented by leveraging the properties of the so-called Distributed Adaptive Signal Fusion (DASF) framework. Despite the lack of such a network-wide pre-whitening, we can still obtain the $Q$ least Gaussian independent components of the centralized ICA solution, where $Q$ scales linearly with the required communication load.</description>

      <title>Computing Game Symmetries and Equilibria That Respect Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strategic interactions can be represented more concisely, and analyzed and solved more efficiently, if we are aware of the symmetries within the multiagent system. Symmetries also have conceptual implications, for example for equilibrium selection. We study the computational complexity of identifying and using symmetries. Using the classical framework of normal-form games, we consider game symmetries that can be across some or all players and/or actions. We find a strong connection between game symmetries and graph automorphisms, yielding graph automorphism and graph isomorphism completeness results for characterizing the symmetries present in a game. On the other hand, we also show that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable when we restrict the consideration of actions in one of two ways.
  Next, we investigate when exactly game symmetries can be successfully leveraged for Nash equilibrium computation. We show that finding a Nash equilibrium that respects a given set of symmetries is PPAD- and CLS-complete in general-sum and team games respectively -- that is, exactly as hard as Brouwer fixed point and gradient descent problems. Finally, we present polynomial-time methods for the special cases where we are aware of a vast number of symmetries, or where the game is two-player zero-sum and we do not even know the symmetries.</description>
