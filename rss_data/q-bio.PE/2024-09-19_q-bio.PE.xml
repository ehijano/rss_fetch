      <title>Dynamics of solutions to a multi-patch epidemic model with a saturation incidence mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the behavior of solutions in a multi-patch epidemic model that includes a saturation incidence mechanism. When the fatality rate due to the disease is not null, our findings show that the solutions of the model tend to stabilize at disease-free equilibria. Conversely, when the disease-induced fatality rate is null, the dynamics of the model become more intricate. Notably, in this scenario, while the saturation effect reduces the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$, it can also lead to a backward bifurcation of the endemic equilibria curve at $\mathcal{R}_0=1$. Provided certain fundamental assumptions are satisfied, we offer a detailed analysis of the global dynamics of solutions based on the value of $\mathcal{R}_0$. Additionally, we investigate the asymptotic profiles of endemic equilibria as population dispersal rates tend to zero. To support and illustrate our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A weather-driven mathematical model of Culex population abundance and the impact of vector control interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even as the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile Virus (WNV) in North America has risen over the past decade, effectively modelling mosquito population density or, the abundance has proven to be a persistent challenge. It is critical to capture the fluctuations in mosquito abundance across seasons in order to forecast the varying risk of disease transmission from one year to the next. We develop a process-based mechanistic weather-driven Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model to study the population biology of both aqueous and terrestrial stages of mosquito population. The progression of mosquito lifecycle through these stages is influenced by different factors, including temperature, daylight hours, intra-species competition and the availability of aquatic habitats. Weather-driven parameters are utilised in our work, are a combination of laboratory research and literature data. In our model, we include precipitation data as a substitute for evaluating additional mortality in the mosquito population. We compute the \textit{Basic offspring number} of the associated model and perform sensitivity analysis. Finally, we employ our model to assess the effectiveness of various adulticides strategies to predict the reduction in mosquito population. This enhancement in modelling of mosquito abundance can be instrumental in guiding interventions aimed at reducing mosquito populations and mitigating mosquito-borne diseases such as the WNV.</description>

      <title>k-mer-based approaches to bridging pangenomics and population genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many commonly studied species now have more than one chromosome-scale genome assembly, revealing a large amount of genetic diversity previously missed by approaches that map short reads to a single reference. However, many species still lack multiple reference genomes and correctly aligning references to build pangenomes is challenging, limiting our ability to study this missing genomic variation in population genetics. Here, we argue that $k$-mers are a crucial stepping stone to bridging the reference-focused paradigms of population genetics with the reference-free paradigms of pangenomics. We review current literature on the uses of $k$-mers for performing three core components of most population genetics analyses: identifying, measuring, and explaining patterns of genetic variation. We also demonstrate how different $k$-mer-based measures of genetic variation behave in population genetic simulations according to the choice of $k$, depth of sequencing coverage, and degree of data compression. Overall, we find that $k$-mer-based measures of genetic diversity scale consistently with pairwise nucleotide diversity ($\pi$) up to values of about $\pi = 0.025$ ($R^2 = 0.97$) for neutrally evolving populations. For populations with even more variation, using shorter $k$-mers will maintain the scalability up to at least $\pi = 0.1$. Furthermore, in our simulated populations, $k$-mer dissimilarity values can be reliably approximated from counting bloom filters, highlighting a potential avenue to decreasing the memory burden of $k$-mer based genomic dissimilarity analyses. For future studies, there is a great opportunity to further develop methods to identifying selected loci using $k$-mers.</description>

      <title>Biological arrow of time: Emergence of tangled information hierarchies and self-modelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study open-ended evolution by focusing on computational and information-processing dynamics underlying major evolutionary transitions. In doing so, we consider biological organisms as hierarchical dynamical systems that generate regularities in their phase-spaces through interactions with their environment. These emergent information patterns can then be encoded within the organism's components, leading to self-modelling "tangled hierarchies". Our main conjecture is that when macro-scale patterns are encoded within micro-scale components, it creates fundamental tensions (computational inconsistencies) between what is encodable at a particular evolutionary stage and what is potentially realisable in the environment. A resolution of these tensions triggers an evolutionary transition which expands the problem-space, at the cost of generating new tensions in the expanded space, in a continual process. We argue that biological complexification can be interpreted computation-theoretically, within the G\"odel--Turing--Post recursion-theoretic framework, as open-ended generation of computational novelty. In general, this process can be viewed as a meta-simulation performed by higher-order systems that successively simulate the computation carried out by lower-order systems. This computation-theoretic argument provides a basis for hypothesising the biological arrow of time.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent returns in nonlinear public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When individuals interact in groups, the evolution of cooperation is traditionally modeled using the framework of public goods games. These models often assume that the return of the public good depends linearly on the fraction of contributors. In contrast, in real life public goods interactions, the return can depend on the size of the investor pool as well. Here, we consider a model in which the multiplication factor (marginal per capita return) for the public good depends linearly on how many contribute, which results in a nonlinear model of public goods. This simple model breaks the curse of dominant defection found in linear public goods interactions and gives rise to richer dynamical outcomes in evolutionary settings. We provide an in-depth analysis of the more varied decisions by the classical rational player in nonlinear public goods interactions as well as a mechanistic, microscopic derivation of the evolutionary outcomes for the stochastic dynamics in finite populations and in the deterministic limit of infinite populations. This kind of nonlinearity provides a natural way to model public goods with diminishing returns as well as economies of scale.</description>
