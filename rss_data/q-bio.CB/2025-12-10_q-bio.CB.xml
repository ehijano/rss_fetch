      <title>Coarse-graining and stochastic oscillations in a phenomenological model of cell-size homeostasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a continuous-time, stochastic model of single-cell size homeostasis, we study how the structure of feedback from size to growth rates and cell-cycle progression shapes overall size dynamics, both within and across cell cycles. We focus on a model in which the feedback from cell size to these other processes occurs only through the size deviations, defined as the difference between the absolute size and the progression through the cell cycle. In a linear regime of this model, the dynamics reduce to a stochastically forced simple harmonic oscillator, yielding closed-form expressions for mother-daughter size correlations. We compare these to the higher order regression coefficients that measure the size memory over many generations. Our analysis reveals how the interplay between cell-cycle timing and intrinsic fluctuations shapes the apparent coarse-grained size control strategy, and in-particular, that coarse-grained correlations may not reflect the mechanistic feedback structure. We compare this model to a more commonly used approach where the coarse-grained dynamics are hard-coded into the model; hence, the first order autoregressive model for sizes is a perfect description of the size dynamics and therefore more accurately reflects the feedback structure.</description>

      <title>SSRCA: a novel machine learning pipeline to perform sensitivity analysis for agent-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA identifies four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. Additionally, we compare the SA results between SSRCA and the popular Sobol' Method and find that SSRCA's identified sensitive parameters are robust to the choice of model descriptors while Sobol's are not. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA Methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>
