      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Democratize Access to Costly Financial Datasets for Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unequal access to costly datasets essential for empirical research has long hindered researchers from disadvantaged institutions, limiting their ability to contribute to their fields and advance their careers. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to democratize data access by automating data collection from unstructured sources. We develop and evaluate a novel methodology using GPT-4o-mini within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to collect data from corporate disclosures. Our approach achieves human-level accuracy in collecting CEO pay ratios from approximately 10,000 proxy statements and Critical Audit Matters (CAMs) from more than 12,000 10-K filings, with LLM processing times of 9 and 40 minutes respectively, each at a cost under $10. This stands in stark contrast to the hundreds of hours needed for manual collection or the thousands of dollars required for commercial database subscriptions. To foster a more inclusive research community by empowering researchers with limited resources to explore new avenues of inquiry, we share our methodology and the resulting datasets.</description>

      <title>Uncertain Regulations, Definite Impacts: The Impact of the US Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulatory Interventions on Crypto Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs an event study methodology to investigate the market impact of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) classification of crypto assets as securities. It explores how SEC interventions influence asset returns and trading volumes, focusing on explicitly named crypto assets. The empirical analysis highlights significant adverse market reactions, notably returns plummeting 12% over one week post-announcement, persisting for a month. We demonstrate that the severity of market reaction depends on sentiment and asset characteristics such as market size, age, volatility, and illiquidity. Further, we identify significant ex-ante trading volume effects indicative of pre-announcement informed trading.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Illicit Account Detection in Ethereum DeFi Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. However, this growth has also introduced significant security risks, including the proliferation of illicit accounts involved in fraudulent activities. Traditional detection methods are limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious actors. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Learning Ensemble-based Illicit account Detection (SLEID) framework to address these challenges. SLEID employs an Isolation Forest for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms traditional supervised approaches and recent semi-supervised models, achieving superior precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly in detecting illicit accounts. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves better detection performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. The results affirm SLEID's efficacy as a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem and mitigating risks posed by malicious accounts.</description>

      <title>DeTEcT: Dynamic and Probabilistic Parameters Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical extension of the DeTEcT framework proposed by Sadykhov et al., DeTEcT, where a formal analysis framework was introduced for modelling wealth distribution in token economies. DeTEcT is a framework for analysing economic activity, simulating macroeconomic scenarios, and algorithmically setting policies in token economies. This paper proposes four ways of parametrizing the framework, where dynamic vs static parametrization is considered along with the probabilistic vs non-probabilistic. Using these parametrization techniques, we demonstrate that by adding restrictions to the framework it is possible to derive the existing wealth distribution models from DeTEcT. In addition to exploring parametrization techniques, this paper studies how money supply in DeTEcT framework can be transformed to become dynamic, and how this change will affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. The motivation for studying dynamic money supply is that it enables DeTEcT to be applied to modelling token economies without maximum supply (i.e., Ethereum), and it adds constraints to the framework in the form of symmetries.</description>
