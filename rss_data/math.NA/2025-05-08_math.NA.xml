      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Deterministic and Probabilistic Approaches to State Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of state estimation from limited discrete and noisy measurements. In particular, we focus on modal state estimation, which approximates the unknown state of the system within a prescribed basis. We estimate the coefficients of the modal expansion using available observational data. This is usually accomplished through two distinct frameworks. One is deterministic and estimates the expansion coefficients by solving a least-squares (LS) problem. The second is probabilistic and uses a Bayesian approach to derive a distribution for the coefficients, resulting in the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate. Here, we seek to quantify and compare the accuracy of these two approaches. To this end, we derive a computable expression for the difference in Bayes risk between the deterministic LS and the Bayesian MAP estimates. We prove that this difference is always nonnegative, indicating that the MAP estimate is always more reliable than the LS estimate. We further show that this difference comprises two nonnegative components representing measurement noise and prior uncertainty, and identify regimes where one component dominates the other in magnitude. We also derive a novel prior distribution from the sample covariance matrix of the training data, and examine the greedy Bayesian and column-pivoted QR (CPQR) sensor placement algorithms with this prior as an input. Using numerical examples, we show that the greedy Bayesian algorithm returns nearly optimal sensor locations. We show that, under certain conditions, the greedy Bayesian sensor locations are identical or nearly identical to those of CPQR when applied to a regularized modal basis.</description>

      <title>Tensor robust principal component analysis via the tensor nuclear over Frobenius norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA), which entails decomposing a given tensor into the sum of a low-rank tensor and a sparse tensor. By leveraging the tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD), we introduce the ratio of the tensor nuclear norm to the tensor Frobenius norm (TNF) as a nonconvex approximation of the tensor's tubal rank in TRPCA. Additionally, we utilize the traditional L1 norm to identify the sparse tensor. For brevity, we refer to the combination of TNF and L1 as simply TNF. Under a series of incoherence conditions, we prove that a pair of tensors serves as a local minimizer of the proposed TNF-based TRPCA model if one tensor is sufficiently low in rank and the other tensor is sufficiently sparse. In addition, we propose replacing the L1 norm with the ratio of the L1 and Frobenius norm for tensors, the latter denoted as the LF norm. We refer to the combination of TNF and L1/LF as the TNF+ model in short. To solve both TNF and TNF+ models, we employ the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and prove subsequential convergence under certain conditions. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic data, real color images, and videos are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed models in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in TRPCA.</description>

      <title>On the Crouzeix-Raviart Finite Element Approximation of Phase-Field Dependent Topology Optimization in Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a nonconforming finite element approximation of phase-field parameterized topology optimization governed by the Stokes flow. The phase field, the velocity field and the pressure field are approximated by conforming linear finite elements, nonconforming linear finite elements (Crouzeix-Raviart elements) and piecewise constants, respectively. When compared with the standard conforming counterpart, the nonconforming FEM can provide an approximation with fewer degrees of freedom, leading to improved computational efficiency. We establish the convergence of the resulting numerical scheme in the sense that the sequences of phase-field functions and discrete velocity fields contain subsequences that converge to a minimizing pair of the continuous problem in the $H^1$-norm and a mesh-dependent norm, respectively. We present extensive numerical results to illustrate the performance of the approach, including a comparison with the popular Taylor-Hood elements.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Mixed Precision and Dynamically Scaled Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive mixed precision and dynamically scaled preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm (AMP-PCG). It dynamically adjusts the precision for storing vectors and computing, exploiting low precision when appropriate, while maintaining a convergence rate and accuracy comparable to that of double precision PCG. Our mixed precision strategy consists of three main components: (1) The residual and matrix-vector product are initially computed in double precision, and the algorithm switches these to single precision based on the chosen convergence tolerance and an estimate of the residual gap. (2) Depending on the eigenvalue distribution, the preconditioned residual and search direction are either in half precision throughout the iterations or initially in double precision and then stepwise reduced to single and half precision. (3) A dynamically scaled residual is used at every iteration to mitigate underflow in half precision. We provide theoretical support for our estimates and we demonstrate the effectiveness of AMP-PCG through numerical experiments, highlighting both its robustness and the significant performance gains (1.63x speedup) achieved compared to double precision PCG on a GPU.</description>

      <title>Modeling of thin plate flexural vibrations by Partition of Unity Finite Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a conforming thin plate bending element based on the Partition of Unity Finite Element Method (PUFEM), for the simulation of steady-state forced vibration. The issue of ensuring the continuity of displacement and slope between elements is addressed by the use of cubic Hermite-type Partition of Unity (PU) functions. With appropriate PU functions, the PUFEM allows the incorporation of the special enrichment functions into the finite elements to better cope with plate oscillations in a broad frequency band. The enrichment strategies consist of the sum of a power series up to a given order and a combination of progressive flexural wave solutions with polynomials. The applicability and the effectiveness of the PUFEM plate elements is first verified via the structural frequency response. Investigation is then carried out to analyze the role of polynomial enrichment orders and enriched plane wave distributions for achieving good computational performance in terms of accuracy and data reduction. Numerical results show that the PUFEM with high-order polynomials and hybrid wave-polynomial combinations can provide highly accurate prediction results by using reduced degrees of freedom and improved rate of convergence, as compared with the classical FEM.</description>

      <title>A block preconditioner for thermo-poromechanics with frictional deformation of fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical modeling of fracture contact thermo-poromechanics is crucial for advancing subsurface engineering applications, including CO2 sequestration, production of geo-energy resources, energy storage and wastewater disposal operations. Accurately modeling this problem presents substantial challenges due to the complex physics involved in strongly coupled thermo-poromechanical processes and the frictional contact mechanics of fractures. To resolve process couplings in the resulting mathematical model, it is common to apply fully implicit time stepping. This necessitates the use of an iterative linear solver to run the model. The solver's efficiency primarily depends on a robust preconditioner, which is particularly challenging to develop because it must handle the mutual couplings between linearized contact mechanics and energy, momentum, and mass balance. In this work, we introduce a preconditioner for the problem based on the nested approximations of Schur complements. To decouple the momentum balance, we utilize the fixed-stress approximation, extended to account for both the porous media and fracture subdomains. The singularity of the contact mechanics submatrix is resolved by a linear transformation. Two variations of the algorithm are proposed to address the coupled mass and energy balance submatrix: either the Constrained Pressure Residual or the System-AMG approach. The preconditioner is evaluated through numerical experiments of fluid injection into fractured porous media, which causes thermal contraction and subsequent sliding and opening of fractures. The experiments show that the preconditioner performs robustly for a wide range of simulation regimes governed by various fracture states, friction coefficients and Peclet number. The grid refinement experiments demonstrate that the preconditioner scales well in terms of GMRES iterations, in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method with transmission variables for time-harmonic electromagnetic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CHDG method is a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element method suitable for the iterative solution of time-harmonic wave propagation problems. Hybrid unknowns corresponding to transmission variables are introduced at the element interfaces and the physical unknowns inside the elements are eliminated, resulting in a hybridized system with favorable properties for fast iterative solution. In this paper, we extend the CHDG method, initially studied for the Helmholtz equation, to the time-harmonic Maxwell equations. We prove that the local problems stemming from hybridization are well-posed and that the fixed-point iteration naturally associated to the hybridized system is contractive. We propose a 3D implementation with a discrete scheme based on nodal basis functions. The resulting solver and different iterative strategies are studied with several numerical examples using a high-performance parallel C++ code.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical formalism and the corresponding numerical techniques to obtain the approximation of fractional-order operators over a 1D domain via the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The method is presented for both constant- and variable-order operators, in either integral or differential forms. Several numerical examples are presented in order to validate the theory against analytical results and to evaluate the performance of the methodology. This formalism paves the way for the solution of fractional-order continuum mechanics models via the SPH method.</description>

      <title>Fast Bellman algorithm for real Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new numerical algorithm for solving the Dirichlet
  problem for the real Monge-Amp\`ere equation. The idea is to represent the
  Monge-Amp\`ere operator as an infimum of a class of linear elliptic operators
  and use Bellman's principle to construct a numeric scheme for approximating
  the operator attaining this infimum.
  We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate
  the performance of the method on several examples with various degrees of
  degeneracy and compare the results to two existing methods. Our method runs considerably faster than the ones
  used for comparison, improving the running time by a factor of 3-10 for smooth,
  strictly convex examples, and by a factor of 20-100 or more for mildly degenerate
  examples.</description>

      <title>Duality-Based Algorithm and Numerical Analysis for Optimal Insulation Problems on Non-Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a numerical approximation of a convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem. The physical problem involves determining the optimal distribution, given by $h\colon \Gamma_I\to [0,+\infty)$, of a given amount $m\in \mathbb{N}$ of insulating material attached to a boundary part $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d \in \mathbb{N}$, subject to conductive heat transfer. To tackle the non-local and non-smooth character of the problem, the article introduces a (Fenchel) duality framework: (a) At the continuous level, using (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a posteriori error identity that can handle arbitrary admissible approximations of the primal and dual formulations of the convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problem; (b) At the discrete level, using discrete (Fenchel) duality relations, we derive an a priori error identity that applies to a Crouzeix--Raviart discretization of the primal formulation and a Raviart--Thomas discretization of the dual formulation. The proposed framework leads to error decay rates that are optimal with respect to the specific regularity of a minimizer. In addition, we prove convergence of the numerical approximation under minimal regularity assumptions. Since the discrete dual formulation can be written as a quadratic program, it is solved using a primal-dual active set strategy interpreted as semismooth Newton method. A solution of the discrete primal formulation is reconstructed from the solution of the discrete dual formulation by means of an inverse generalized Marini formula. This is the first such formula for this class of convex non-local and non-smooth minimization problems.</description>

Abstract: A method for solving an inverse spectral problem for the one-dimensional Dirac equation is developed. The method is based on the Gelfand-Levitan equation and the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. A linear algebraic system of equations is obtained, which can be solved numerically.

      <title>Multilevel Sampling in Algebraic Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a multilevel sampling algorithm for fiber sampling problems in algebraic statistics, inspired by Henry Wynn's suggestion to adapt multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) ideas to discrete models. Focusing on log-linear models, we sample from high-dimensional lattice fibers defined by algebraic constraints. Building on Markov basis methods and results from Diaconis and Sturmfels, our algorithm uses variable step sizes to accelerate exploration and reduce the need for long burn-in. We introduce a novel Fiber Coverage Score (FCS) based on Voronoi partitioning to assess sample quality, and highlight the utility of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) quality metric. Simulations on benchmark fibers show that multilevel sampling outperforms naive MCMC approaches. Our results demonstrate that multilevel methods, when properly applied, provide practical benefits for discrete sampling in algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed DeepONets for drift-diffusion on metric graphs: simulation and parameter identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel physics informed deep learning approach for solving nonlinear drift-diffusion equations on metric graphs. These models represent an important model class with a large number of applications in areas ranging from transport in biological cells to the motion of human crowds. While traditional numerical schemes require a large amount of tailoring, especially in the case of model design or parameter identification problems, physics informed deep operator networks (DeepONet) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution of partial differential equations with the particular advantage that they easily incorporate parameter identification questions. We here present an approach where we first learn three DeepONet models for representative inflow, inner and outflow edges, resp., and then subsequently couple these models for the solution of the drift-diffusion metric graph problem by relying on an edge-based domain decomposition approach. We illustrate that our framework is applicable for the accurate evaluation of graph-coupled physics models and is well suited for solving optimization or inverse problems on these coupled networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Black-Scholes equations via Schr\"{o}dingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct quantum circuits for the Black-Scholes equations, a cornerstone of financial modeling, based on a quantum algorithm that overcome the cure of high dimensionality. Our approach leverages the Schr\"odingerisation technique, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into a system evolved by unitary dynamics. This is achieved through a warped phase transformation that lifts the problem into a higher-dimensional space, enabling the simulation of the Black-Scholes equation on a quantum computer. We will conduct a thorough complexity analysis to highlight the quantum advantages of our approach compared to existing algorithms. The effectiveness of our quantum circuit is substantiated through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Localized Diffusion Models for High Dimensional Distributions Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art tools for various generative tasks. However, estimating high-dimensional score functions makes them potentially suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD). This underscores the importance of better understanding and exploiting low-dimensional structure in the target distribution. In this work, we consider locality structure, which describes sparse dependencies between model components. Under locality structure, the score function is effectively low-dimensional, so that it can be estimated by a localized neural network with significantly reduced sample complexity. This motivates the localized diffusion model, where a localized score matching loss is used to train the score function within a localized hypothesis space. We prove that such localization enables diffusion models to circumvent CoD, at the price of additional localization error. Under realistic sample size scaling, we show both theoretically and numerically that a moderate localization radius can balance the statistical and localization error, leading to a better overall performance. The localized structure also facilitates parallel training of diffusion models, making it potentially more efficient for large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive finite element method for an unregularized semilinear optimal control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise an a posteriori error estimator for an affine optimal control problem subject to a semilinear elliptic PDE and control constraints. To approximate the problem, we consider a semidiscrete scheme based on the variational discretization approach. For this solution technique, we design an a posteriori error estimator that accounts for the discretization of the state and adjoint equations, and prove, under suitable local growth conditions of optimal controls, reliability and efficiency properties of such error estimator. A simple adaptive strategy based on the devised estimator is designed and its performance is illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to develop the anti-Gauss cubature rule for approximating integrals defined on the square whose integrand function may have algebraic singularities at the boundaries. An application of such a rule to the numerical solution of Fredholm integral equations of the second-kind is also explored. The stability, convergence, and conditioning of the proposed Nystr\"om-type method are studied. The numerical solution of the resulting dense linear system is also investigated and several numerical tests are presented.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation principles for finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unique continuation principles are fundamental properties of elliptic partial differential equations, giving conditions that guarantee that the solution to an elliptic equation must be uniformly zero. Since finite-element discretizations are a natural tool to help gain understanding into elliptic equations, it is natural to ask if such principles also hold at the discrete level. In this work, we prove a version of the unique continuation principle for piecewise-linear and -bilinear finite-element discretizations of the Laplacian eigenvalue problem on polygonal domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Namely, we show that any solution to the discretized equation $-\Delta u = \lambda u$ with vanishing Dirichlet and Neumann traces must be identically zero under certain geometric and topological assumptions on the resulting triangulation. We also provide a counterexample, showing that a nonzero \emph{inner solution} exists when the topological assumptions are not satisfied. Finally, we give an application to an eigenvalue interlacing problem, where the space of inner solutions makes an explicit appearance.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of a Fully Discrete Scheme for The Cahn--Hilliard Cross-Diffusion Model in Lymphangiogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a stabilized finite element scheme for the Cahn--Hilliard cross-diffusion model, which is characterized by strongly coupled mobilities, nonlinear diffusion, and complex cross-diffusion terms. These features pose significant analytical and computational challenges, particularly due to the destabilizing effects of cross-diffusion and the absence of standard structural properties. To address these issues, we establish discrete energy stability and prove the existence of a finite element solution for the proposed scheme. A key contribution of this work is the derivation of rigorous error estimates, utilizing the novel $L^{\frac{4}{3}}(0,T; L^{\frac{6}{5}}(\Omega))$ norm for the chemical potential. This enables a comprehensive convergence analysis, where we derive error estimates in the $L^{\infty}(H^1(\Omega))$ and $L^{\infty}(L^2(\Omega))$ norms, and establish convergence of the numerical solution in the $L^{\frac{4}{3}}(0,T; W^{1,\frac{6}{5}}(\Omega))$ norm. Furthermore, the convergence analysis relies on a uniform bound of the form $\sum_{k=0}^n\tau\|\nabla(\cdot)\|_{L^{\frac{6}{5}}}^{\frac{4}{3}}$ to control the chemical potentials, marking a clear departure from the classical $\sum_{k=0}^n\tau\|\nabla(\cdot)\|_{L^{2}}^{2}$ estimate commonly used in Cahn--Hilliard-type models. Our approach builds upon and extends existing frameworks, effectively addressing challenges posed by cross-diffusion effects and the lack of uniform estimates. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the scheme's ability to capture phase separation dynamics consistent with the Cahn--Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>Integrating adaptive optimization into least squares progressive iterative approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Adaptive Gradient Least Squares Progressive iterative Approximation (AdagradLSPIA), an accelerated version of the Least Squares Progressive Iterative Approximation (LSPIA) method, enhanced with adaptive optimization techniques inspired by the adaptive gradient (Adagrad) algorithm. By using historical (accumulated) gradient information to dynamically adjust weights, AdagradLSPIA achieves faster convergence compared to the standard LSPIA method. The effectiveness of AdagradLSPIA is demonstrated through its application to tensor product B-spline surface fitting, where this method consistently outperforms LSPIA in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness to variations in global weight selection.</description>

      <title>A quantitative comparison of high-order asymptotic-preserving and asymptotically-accurate IMEX methods for the Euler equations with non-ideal gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantitative comparison between two different Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) approaches for the Euler equations of gas dynamics, specifically tailored for the low Mach limit. In this regime, a classical IMEX-RK approach involves an implicit coupling between the momentum and energy balance so as to avoid the acoustic CFL restriction, while the density can be treated in a fully explicit fashion. This approach leads to a mildly nonlinear equation for the pressure, which can be solved according to a fixed point procedure. An alternative strategy consists of employing a semi-implicit temporal integrator based on IMEX-RK methods (SI-IMEX-RK). The stiff dependence is carefully analyzed, so as to avoid the solution of a nonlinear equation for the pressure also for equations of state (EOS) of non-ideal gases. The spatial discretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which naturally allows high-order accuracy. The asymptotic-preserving (AP) and the asymptotically-accurate (AA) properties of the two approaches are assessed on a number of classical benchmarks for ideal gases and on their extension to non-ideal gases.</description>

      <title>Stable Volume Dissipation for High-Order Finite-Difference and Spectral-Element Methods with the Summation-by-Parts Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of stable, conservative, and accurate volume dissipation is extended to discretizations that possess a generalized summation-by-parts (SBP) property within a tensor-product framework. The dissipation operators can be applied to any finite-difference or spectral-element scheme that uses the SBP framework, including high-order entropy-stable schemes. Additionally, we clarify the incorporation of a variable coefficient within the operator structure and analyze the impact of a boundary correction matrix on operator structure and accuracy. Following the theoretical development and construction of novel dissipation operators, we relate the presented volume dissipation to the use of upwind SBP operators. When applied to spectral-element methods, the presented approach yields unique dissipation operators that can also be derived through alternative approaches involving orthogonal polynomials. Numerical examples featuring the linear convection, Burgers, and Euler equations verify the properties of the constructed dissipation operators and assess their performance compared to existing upwind SBP schemes, including linear stability behaviour. When applied to entropy-stable schemes, the presented approach results in accurate and robust methods that can solve a broader range of problems where comparable existing methods fail.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Refiner: Accurate Fine-Tuning of Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework to address these issues. A new spatiotemporal adaptation is proposed to generalize any Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) variant to learn maps between Bochner spaces, which can perform an arbitrary-length temporal super-resolution for the first time. To better exploit this capacity, a new paradigm is proposed to refine the commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations with the help from the wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed paradigm trains an FNO only for a few epochs. Then, only the newly proposed spatiotemporal spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The spectral fine-tuning loss function uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type a posteriori error estimator whose evaluation is exact thanks to the Parseval identity. Moreover, unlike the difficult nonconvex optimization problems in the end-to-end training, this fine-tuning loss is convex. Numerical experiments on commonly used NSE benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers under certain conditions.

      <title>Stein's method for marginals on large graphical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many spatial models exhibit locality structures that effectively reduce their intrinsic dimensionality, enabling efficient approximation and sampling of high-dimensional distributions. However, existing approximation techniques mainly focus on joint distributions, and do not guarantee accuracy for low-dimensional marginals. By leveraging the locality structures, we establish a dimension independent uniform error bound for the marginals of approximate distributions. Inspired by the Stein's method, we introduce a novel $\delta$-locality condition that quantifies the locality in distributions, and link it to the structural assumptions such as the sparse graphical models. The theoretical guarantee motivates the localization of existing sampling methods, as we illustrate through the localized likelihood-informed subspace method and localized score matching. We show that by leveraging the locality structure, these methods greatly reduce the sample complexity and computational cost via localized and parallel implementations.</description>

      <title>Core-periphery detection in multilayer networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems that capture different types of interactions between the same set of entities across multiple layers. Core-periphery detection involves partitioning the nodes of a network into core nodes, which are highly connected across the network, and peripheral nodes, which are densely connected to the core but sparsely connected among themselves. In this paper, we propose a new model of core-periphery in multilayer network and a nonlinear spectral method that simultaneously detects the corresponding core and periphery structures of both nodes and layers in weighted and directed multilayer networks. Our method reveals novel structural insights in three empirical multilayer networks from distinct application areas: the citation network of complex network scientists, the European airlines transport network, and the world trade network.</description>
