      <title>Macroscopic Market Making Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In continuation of the macroscopic market making \`a la Avellaneda-Stoikov as a control problem, this paper explores its stochastic game. Concerning the price competition, each agent is compared with the best quote from the others. We start with the linear case. While constructing the solution directly, the ordering property and the dimension reduction in the equilibrium are revealed. For the non-linear case, extending the decoupling approach, we introduce a multidimensional characteristic equation to study the well-posedness of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Properties of coefficients in the characteristic equation are obtained via non-smooth analysis. In addition to novel well-posedness results, the linear price impact arises and the impact function can be further decomposed into two parts in some examples.</description>

      <title>Affine models with path-dependence under parameter uncertainty and their application in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider one-dimensional generalized affine processes under the paradigm of Knightian uncertainty (so-called non-linear generalized affine models). This extends and generalizes previous results in Fadina et al. (2019) and L\"utkebohmert et al. (2022). In particular, we study the case when the payoff is allowed to depend on the path, like it is the case for barrier options or Asian options. To this end, we develop the path-dependent setting for the value function which we do by relying on functional It\^o calculus. We establish a dynamic programming principle which then leads to a functional non-linear Kolmogorov equation describing the evolution of the value function. While for Asian options, the valuation can be traced back to PDE methods, this is no longer possible for more complicated payoffs like barrier options. To handle such payoffs in an efficient manner, we approximate the functional derivatives with deep neural networks and show that the numerical valuation under parameter uncertainty is highly tractable. Finally, we consider the application to structural modelling of credit and counterparty risk, where both parameter uncertainty and path-dependence are crucial and the approach proposed here opens the door to efficient numerical methods in this field.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Market Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the macroscopic market making model \`a la Avellaneda-Stoikov, using continuous processes for orders instead of discrete point processes. The model intends to bridge a gap between market making and optimal execution problems, while shedding light on the influence of order flows on the strategy. We demonstrate our model through three problems. The study provides a comprehensive analysis from Markovian to non-Markovian noises and from linear to non-linear intensity functions, encompassing both bounded and unbounded coefficients. Mathematically, the contribution lies in the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control, guaranteed by the well-posedness of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation or the (non-)Lipschitz forward-backward stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of VaR with jump process: application in corn and soybean markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Value at Risk (VaR) is a quantitative measure used to evaluate the risk linked to the potential loss of investment or capital. Estimation of the VaR entails the quantification of prospective losses in a portfolio of investments, using a certain likelihood, under normal market conditions within a specific time period. The objective of this paper is to construct a model and estimate the VaR for a diversified portfolio consisting of multiple cash commodity positions driven by standard Brownian motions and jump processes. Subsequently, a thorough analytical estimation of the VaR is conducted for the proposed model. The results are then applied to two distinct commodities -- corn and soybean -- enabling a comprehensive comparison of the VaR values in the presence and absence of jumps.</description>

      <title>The geometry of multi-curve interest rate models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problems of consistency and of the existence of finite-dimensional realizations for multi-curve interest rate models of Heath-Jarrow-Morton type, generalizing the geometric approach developed by T. Bj\"ork and co-authors in the classical single-curve setting. We characterize when a multi-curve interest rate model is consistent with a given parameterized family of forward curves and spreads and when a model can be realized by a finite-dimensional state process. We illustrate the general theory in a number of model classes and examples, providing explicit constructions of finite-dimensional realizations. Based on these theoretical results, we perform the calibration of a three-curve Hull-White model to market data and analyse the stability of the estimated parameters.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Asset Pricing in a Unified Bachelier-Black-Scholes-Merton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified, market-complete model that integrates both the Bachelier and Black-Scholes-Merton frameworks for asset pricing. The model allows for the study, within a unified framework, of asset pricing in a natural world that experiences the possibility of negative security prices or riskless rates. In contrast to classical Black-Scholes-Merton, we show that option pricing in the unified model displays a difference depending on whether the replicating, self-financing portfolio uses riskless bonds or a single riskless bank account. We derive option price formulas and extend our analysis to the term structure of interest rates by deriving the pricing of zero-coupon bonds, forward contracts, and futures contracts. We identify a necessary condition for the unified model to support a perpetual derivative. Discrete binomial pricing under the unified model is also developed. In every scenario analyzed, we show that the unified model simplifies to the standard Black-Scholes-Merton pricing under specific limits and provides pricing in the Bachelier model limit. We note that the Bachelier limit within the unified model allows for positive riskless rates. The unified model prompts us to speculate on the possibility of a mixed multiplicative and additive deflator model for risk-neutral option pricing.</description>
