      <title>Core-Corona Decomposition of Very Compact (Neutron) Stars: Accounting for Current Data of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point with neutron-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic model for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP) and the equation of state (EOS) at $\beta$-equilibrium, constrained by neutron-star observations. Using a hybrid framework that combines the holographic V-QCD model with an effective van der Waals description of nuclear matter, we generate a large ensemble of EOSs incorporating nuclear theory uncertainties. Constraining this ensemble with neutron-star mass-radius data and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational waves, we identify a strong first-order deconfinement transition at zero temperature, with a transition strength of $\Delta n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 3.75^{+0.70}_{-0.53}$ and onset density $n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 4.9^{+1.33}_{-1.17}$. The resulting posterior yields $95\%$ credible intervals for the CEP location: $\mu_{\rm{crit}} = 626^{+90}_{-179}\,\rm{MeV}$, $T_{\rm{crit}} = 119^{+14}_{-6}\,\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>QPEs from EMRI Debris Streams Impacting Accretion Disks in Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with hours-days period, brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star-disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically follow the evolution of the stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI's Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream, that subsequently collides with the disk, half an orbit after the previous star-disk encounter. At sufficiently long orbital periods ($\gtrsim 12$ hr), the stream is too dilute to penetrate the disk, and is instead strongly shocked and deflected at its surface through a reverse shock. We obtain the resulting emission and explore implications for QPE observations. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over that from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star or by ejecta confined within its Hill sphere, as was first proposed by Yao et al. 2025. We find that: (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream-disk collision timescale; (2) Flare luminosities of $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) Soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ${\sim}$100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation-Driven Chaotic Tide in a White Dwarf-Massive Black Hole Binary as a Source of Repeating X-ray Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eccentric white dwarf-massive black hole binaries can potentially source some extreme X-ray transients, including the recently observed quasi-periodic X-ray eruptions and tidal disruption events at the galactic nuclei. Meanwhile, they are one of the target gravitational wave sources with extreme mass ratios for future millihertz gravitational wave missions. In this work, we focus on the tidal evolution and orbital dynamics of such binaries under the influence of the tidal backreaction and the dissipative effect from gravitational wave emission. We find that the latter can cause the dynamical tide to evolve chaotically after more than one orbital harmonics encounter the mode resonance through orbital decay. Different from the tidal-driven chaos, which only occurs for pericenter distances within around two times the tidal radius ($R_t$), this gravitational wave-driven chaos can happen at much larger pericenter distances. The growth scales similarly to a diffusive process, in which the tidal energy grows linearly with time on average over a long duration. If the tidal energy eventually approaches the stellar binding energy, achievable when the pericenter distance is less than $4R_t$, it can cause mass ejection as the wave breaks due to nonlinear effects. We show that this can potentially lead to the repeating partial tidal disruptions observed at galactic centers. That means these disruptions can occur at a much larger pericenter distance than previous analytical estimates. Furthermore, if the system can evolve to a close pericenter distance of about 2.7$R_t$, the white dwarf can further lose mass via tidal stripping at each pericenter passage. This provides a mechanism for producing the quasi-periodic eruptions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of QPO During Discovery Outburst of MAXI J1834-021: Estimation of Intrinsic Parameters from Spectro-Temporal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic transient black hole candidate (BHC) MAXI~J1834-021 was detected for the first time by MAXI/GSC on February 05, 2023 and it was active for next $\sim 10$~months. A monotonic evolution of low-frequency QPOs from higher to lower frequencies is observed in the middle-phase of the outburst. We study this evolution of the QPO with the propagating oscillatory shock (POS) model, and it suggests the presence of a receding shock. The POS model fit also estimates the mass of the source to be $12.1\pm0.3~M_\odot$. We also study the boradband ($0.5$-$70$~keV) nature of the source using archival data of NICER and NuSTAR on March 10, 2023 with the both phenomenological (combined disk blackbody plus powerlaw) and physical (\textit{nthComp, kerrbb, TCAF}) models. The mass of the BHC estimated by the \texttt{kerbb} and \texttt{TCAF} models is found to be consistent with POS model fits as well as reported in our recent work. Combining all these methods, we predict mass of the source as $12.3^{+1.1}_{-2.0}~M_\odot$. The \texttt{kerbb} model fit also estimates the spin, distance, and inclination of the source to be $0.13^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $9.2^{+0.4}_{-0.9}$~kpc, and $80^\circ.0$$^{+2.7}_{-6.0}$, respectively. The combined spectral study suggests harder spectral state of the source with a higher dominance of the sub-Keplerian halo accretion rate over the Keplerian disk rate. The consistency of the observed frequency of the QPO with that of obtained from the \texttt{TCAF} model fitted shock parameters, confirms shock oscillation as the origin of the QPO.</description>

      <title>Searching for radio pulses from radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present periodicity and single-pulse searches at 1250 MHz for 22 radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars, conducted using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST). For PSR J1813$-$1246, we successfully detected pulsed signals with a spin period of 48.08 ms and a dispersion measure of 209.85 ${\rm pc cm^{-3}}$, consistent with the spin period measured at gamma-ray wavelengths. The estimated flux density is approximately 9 $\mu$Jy. For the remaining 21 sources, no radio emission was detected, with flux density upper limits of several $ \mu$Jy. The capability to detect pulsars with such low flux densities provides the opportunity to determine if and how these faint sources differ from much radio-brighter pulsars.</description>

      <title>SN 2023xgo: Helium rich Type Icn or Carbon-Flash Type Ibn supernova?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of SN 2023xgo, a transitional Type Ibn/Icn SN, from $-5.6$ to 63 days relative to $r$-band peak. Early spectra show CIII $\lambda$5696 emission like Type Icn SNe, shifting to Type Ibn features. The He I velocities (1800-10000 km s$^{-1}$) and pseudo-equivalent widths are among the highest in the Ibn/Icn class. The light curve declines at 0.14 mag d$^{-1}$ until 30 days, matching SNe Ibn/Icn but slower than fast transients. SN 2023xgo is the faintest in our SN Ibn sample (M$_{r}$ = -17.65 $\pm$ 0.04) but shows typical colour and host properties. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curve suggests a compact CSM shell (10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm), mass-loss rate between 10$^{-4}$-10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with CSM and ejecta masses of $\sim$0.22 and 0.12 M$_{\odot}$, respectively. Post-maximum light-curve, spectral modelling favours a $\sim$3 M$_{\odot}$ helium star progenitor with extended ($\sim$10$^{15}$ cm), stratified CSM (density exponent of 2.9) and mass-loss rate of 0.1-2.7 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These two mass-loss regimes imply a radially varying CSM, shaped by asymmetry or changes in the progenitors mass loss over time. This mass-loss behavior fits both binary and single-star evolution. Early Icn-like features stem from hot carbon ionization, fading to Ibn-like with cooling. SN 2023xgo thus offers rare insight into the connection between SNe Icn, Ibn, and SNe Ibn with ejecta signatures.</description>

      <title>Identifying Compact Chirping SMBHBs in LSST using Bayesian Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe up to ${\sim}100$ million quasars in the next decade. In this work, we show that it is possible to use such data to measure the characteristic frequency evolution of a "chirp" induced by gravitational waves, which can serve as robust evidence for the presence of a compact supermassive black-hole binary. Following the LSST specifications, we generate mock lightcurves consisting of (i) a post-Newtonian chirp produced by orbital motion through, e.g., relativistic Doppler boosting, (ii) a damped random walk representing intrinsic quasar variability, and (iii) Gaussian photometric errors, while assuming non-uniform observations with extended gaps over a period of 10 yr. Through a fully-Bayesian analysis, we show that we can simultaneously measure the chirp and noise parameters with little degeneracy between the two. For chirp signals with an amplitude of $A = 0.5$ mag and a range of times to merger ($t_m = 15{-}10^4$ yr), we can typically measure a non-zero amplitude and positive frequency derivative with over $5\sigma$ credibility. For binaries with $t_m = 50$ yr, we achieve $3\sigma$ ($5\sigma$) confidence that the signal is chirping for $A \gtrsim 0.1$ ($A &gt; 0.2$). Our analysis can take as little as 35 s (and typically $&lt;$ 10 min) to run, making it scalable to a large number of lightcurves. This implies that LSST could, on its own, establish the presence of a compact supermassive black-hole binary, and thus discover gravitational wave sources detectable by LISA and by Pulsar Timing Arrays.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Localization of the Swift-Observed FRB 20241228A in a Star-forming Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2024 December 28, CHIME/FRB detected the thus-far non-repeating FRB 20241228A with a real-time signal-to-noise ratio of $&gt;50$. Approximately 112~s later, the X-ray Telescope onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was on source, the fastest follow-up to-date of a non-repeating FRB (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). Using CHIME/FRB and two of the three CHIME/FRB Outriggers, we obtained a Very Long Baseline Interferometry localization for FRB 20241228A with a 1$\sigma$ confidence ellipse of 11$^{\prime\prime}$ by 0.2$^{\prime\prime}$. This represents the first published localization using both the CHIME-KKO and CHIME-GBO Outriggers. We associate FRB 20241228A with a star-forming galaxy at a redshift of $z = 0.1614\pm0.0002$. The persistent X-ray luminosity limit at this source's location and distance is $&lt;1.2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the $0.3-10$ keV band, the most stringent limit of any non-repeating FRB to-date (Tohuvavohu et al. in prep.). The stellar mass ($\sim 2.6 \times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$) and star formation rate ($\sim 2.9\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) of the host galaxy of FRB 20241228A are consistent with the broader FRB host galaxy population. We measure significant scattering ($\sim$1ms) and scintillation ($\sim$20 kHz at 600 MHz) along the line of sight to this source, and suggest the scintillation screen is Galactic while the scattering screen is extragalactic. FRB 20241228A represents an exciting example of a new era in which we can harness VLBI-localizations and rapid high-energy follow-up to probe FRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>Search for Primordial Black Holes from the International Space Station with the SQM-ISS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the observational capabilities and sensitivity of the SQM-ISS detector to primordial black holes. The SQM-ISS experiment aims to detect slow, non relativistic massive particles within cosmic rays, using a detector on board the International Space Station. The device is designed to recognize the passage of highly penetrating and dense particles in a wide range of mass and charge states such as Strange Quark Matter (SQM). These particles, traveling at speeds typical of gravitationally bound objects in the galaxy - around 250 km/s - are also possible candidates of dark matter. The ability of SQM-ISS to identify penetrating, massive and slow-moving objects allows it also to be sensitive to the detection of primordial black holes. We discuss how black holes, traveling through the detector at velocities compatible with galactic orbital speeds, can be identified based on their interaction signatures.</description>

      <title>On the use and interpretation of signal-model indistinguishability measures for gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difference ("mismatch") between two gravitational-wave (GW) signals is often used to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which they will be distinguishable in a measurement or, alternatively, when the errors in a signal model will lead to biased measurements. It is well known that the standard approach to calculate this "indistinguishability SNR" is too conservative: a model may fail the criterion at a given SNR, but not necessarily incur a biased measurement of any individual parameters. This problem can be solved by taking into account errors orthogonal to the model space (which therefore do not induce a bias), and calculating indistinguishability SNRs for individual parameters, rather than the full $N$-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate this approach with the simple example of aligned-spin binary-black-hole signals, and calculate accurate estimates of the SNR at which each parameter measurement will be biased. In general biases occur at much higher SNRs than predicted from the standard mismatch calculation. Which parameters are most easily biased depends sensitively on the details of a given waveform model, and the location in parameter space, and in some cases the bias SNR is as high as the conservative estimate. We also illustrate how the parameter bias SNR can be used to robustly specify waveform accuracy requirements for future detectors.</description>

      <title>Origin of Radio Emission in Three Nearby Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies with Signatures of Luminous Buried Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 2.3 and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744, accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4 GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of $10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum, characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at high frequencies arises from particles accelerated by merger dynamics or AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Gapless superfluidity in neutron stars: Normal-fluid fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our previous investigation within the time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory showed that the nuclear superfluids contained inside cold neutron stars could become gapless under certain circumstances. The absence of a gap in the energy spectrum of quasiparticle excitations leads to a specific heat that is comparable to that in the normal phase in sharp contrast with the exponential suppression in the BCS phase of type $^1S_0$ pairing. Here, we further study gapless superfluidity within the same microscopic framework focusing on hydrodynamic properties. In particular, we calculate the mass fraction transported by the normal fluid of quasiparticle excitations, and we find that it can be finite even at zero temperature. We derive an approximate analytical formula for arbitrary neutron-proton superfluid mixtures. We also present numerical results for neutron stars. Our study suggests that the dynamics of neutron stars may be much more complicated than previously thought. The realization of gapless superfluidity in neutron stars and its implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electric conductivity and flavor diffusion in a viscous, resistive quark-gluon plasma for weak and strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic calculation of the electric conductivity and net-particle diffusion coefficients for a viscous and resistive ultra-relativistic plasma. Our results might be of interest for several astrophysical and cosmological problems, but the main physical application we have in mind is the hot deconfined matter produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Accordingly, as charged particles of the medium we take three species (flavors) of light (massless for the sake of simplicity) quarks -- $u$, $d$ and $s$ -- and antiquarks, entailing the existence of three macroscopic conserved charges: baryon number ${\cal B}$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$. Our results are valid both in a weakly and in a strongly-magnetized plasma, where the energy stored in the magnetic field is comparable to the one carried by the medium particles. Actually, for a conformal fluid, the behavior of the system only depends on the ratio between the thermal and the magnetic pressure, the so-called plasma beta-parameter, acting as a scaling variable. Our calculation, starting from a relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation, is based on a generalized Chapman-Enskog approach in which space-time gradients and the local electric field are treated as first-order quantities in a perturbative expansion, while terms containing magnetic corrections are considered of zeroth order and hence self-consistently resummed. We find that, also in the strong-field limit, for each conserved charge a generalized Wiedemann-Franz law, connecting charge conductivity and diffusion coefficient, exists. However these transport coefficients acquire a non-trivial tensor structure, reflecting the development of a longitudinal, a transverse and a Hall current as a response to electric fields or density gradients.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon=1/3-\phi$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Using the IPAD-TOV method based on an Intrinsic and Perturbatively Analysis of the Dimensionless (IPAD) Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv GM_{\rm{NS}}/Rc^2\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\overline{\Pi}_{\rm{c}}\equiv\Pi_{\rm{c}}\cdot(1+18\x/25)\equiv\x/(1+3\x^2+4\x)\cdot(1+18\rm{X}/25)$ where $\x\equiv\phi_{\rm{c}}= P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\x$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-insensitively the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Generation of Large-scale Magnetic Fields Upstream of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origins of the magnetic fields that power gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow emission are not fully understood. One possible channel for generating these fields involves the pre-conditioning of the circumburst medium: in the early afterglow phase, prompt photons streaming ahead of the GRB external shock can pair produce, seeding the upstream with drifting electron-positron pairs and triggering electromagnetic microinstabilities. To study this process, we employ 2D periodic particle-in-cell simulations in which a cold electron-proton plasma is gradually enriched with warm electron-positron pairs injected at mildly relativistic speeds. We find that continuous pair injection drives the growth of large-scale magnetic fields via filamentation-like instabilities; the temporal evolution of the field is self-similar and depends on a single parameter, $\left[\alpha/(t_{\rm f} \omega_{\rm pi})\right]^{1/2} t\omega_{\rm pi}$, where $\alpha$ is the ratio of final pair beam density to background plasma density, $t_{\rm f}$ is the duration of pair injection, and $\omega_{\rm pi}$ is the plasma frequency of background protons. Extrapolating our results to parameter regimes realistic for long GRBs, we find that upstream pair enrichment generates weak magnetic fields on scales much larger than the proton skin depth; for bright bursts, the extrapolated coherence scale at a shock radius of $R \sim 10^{17} \, {\rm cm}$ is $\left&lt;\lambda_y\right&gt; \sim 100 \; c/\omega_{\rm pi}$ and the corresponding magnetization is $\sigma \sim 10^{-8}$ for typical circumburst parameters. These results may help explain the persistence of magnetic fields at large distances behind GRB shocks.</description>

      <title>Searching for Radio Transients with Inverted Spectra in Epoch 1 of VLASS and VCSS, and Identification of a Sample of Candidate Relativistic Nuclear Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For radio transients, an inverted spectrum (defined as $\alpha &gt; 0$ for a power law spectrum $S_{\nu}\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) constrains physical properties, which in principle can be a useful criterion for selecting specific targets of interest in a transient search. To test and develop this concept, we have searched epoch 1 of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS; 3.0 GHz) and the VLITE Commensal Sky Survey (VCSS; 340 MHz) for radio transients with inverted spectra. We discover a sample of 21 inverted-spectra transient candidates that are not associated with cataloged active galactic nuclei (AGNs). To the best of our knowledge, three of our candidates have recently been reported by others as radio transients, but none have reported transient counterparts at other wavelengths. We find that our candidates evolve slowly over years and show either highly inverted spectra or peaked spectra over $\sim$1--3 GHz. Within our sample, nine candidates are matched to optical centers of galaxies and have estimated radio spectral luminosities of $L_{3.0\mathrm{GHz}}\sim10^{30}-10^{33}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$. Based on the observed properties, we find the most plausible transient classification for our candidates to be relativistic tidal disruption events. However, it is difficult to rule out variable or transient AGNs with highly inverted spectra. Upon examining physical constraints, we confirm that mainly relativistic transients (on-axis or off-axis) with equipartition energy $E_{\mathrm{eq}}\gtrsim10^{49}-10^{53}\,\mathrm{erg}$ are expected from searching VLASS and VCSS based on inverted spectra. The obtainable physical constraints, however, can be weak due to degeneracy introduced by viewing angle.</description>

      <title>Searching for Axion-Like Particles with X-ray Observations of Alpha Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) in stellar cores, where they interact with electromagnetic fields and electrons, with typical masses between $\mathcal O(0.1)$ and $\mathcal O(10)$ keV. These low-energy ALPs are gravitationally trapped in the orbits of stars and subsequently decay into two photons that we detect as monochromatic X-ray lines. We propose to search for these gravitationally trapped ALPs in the Alpha Centauri binary system, our closest stellar neighbor, using sensitive X-ray detectors like Chandra and eROSITA. Our search for ALP decay signals in the energy range of $0.2$ keV to $10$ keV yielded null results, thus establishing the most stringent limits on ALP interactions to date. In the case of ALP-electron coupling $g_{aee}\leq 10^{-15}$, we have improved the limits on the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ in ALP mass range between $0.25~\keV$ and $5~\keV$, compared to previous measurements, including those from GW170817, SN 2023ixf, and other sources, and specially the improvement reaches about 2 orders of magnitude at the mass of 2 keV. Even tighter constraints are set for larger $g_{aee}$.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>

Abstract: Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.</description>

Abstract: The secondary/primary cosmic-ray ratios and the diffuse backgrounds of gamma rays and neutrinos provide us with complementary information about the transport of Galactic cosmic rays~(CRs). We used the recent measurement of the diffuse gamma ray background in the $\sim \rm TeV -\rm PeV$ range by LHAASO and of the very high-energy diffuse neutrino background from the Galactic disc by IceCube to show that CRs may be accumulating an approximately energy independent grammage $X\sim 0.4\, \rm g \, \rm cm^{-2}$, in regions where gamma rays and neutrinos are produced with a hard spectrum, resembling the source spectrum. We speculate that this grammage reflects the early stages of cosmic ray transport around sources, in what are referred to as cocoons, where particles spend $\sim 0.3\, \rm Myr$ before starting their journey in the Galactic environment.</description>

Abstract: The origin of the high-energy emission in astrophysical jets from black holes is a highly debated issue. This is particularly true for jets from supermassive black holes that are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. So far, the addition of new observations and new messengers have only managed to create more questions than answers. However, the newly available X-ray polarization observations promise to finally distinguish between emission models. We use extensive multiwavelength and polarization campaigns as well as state-of-the-art polarized spectral energy distribution models to attack this problem by focusing on two X-ray polarization observations of blazar BL Lacertae in flaring and quiescent $\gamma$-ray states. We find that regardless of the jet composition and underlying emission model, inverse-Compton scattering from relativistic electrons dominates at X-ray energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos from supernovae, especially those emitted during the late phase of core collapse, are essential for understanding the final stages of massive star evolution. We have been dedicated to developing methods for the analysis of neutrinos emitted during the late phase and observed at Super-Kamiokande (SK). Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the progenitor models of fast radio bursts from population synthesis with the first CHIME/FRB catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic extragalactic radio transients with unknown origins. We performed comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog to test whether the FRB population tracks the cosmic star formation history directly or requires a delay. By fully considering CHIME's complex selection effects and beam response, we find that the hypothesis that the FRB population tracks the SFH is not ruled out by the current data, although a small delay is preferred. This is consistent with the scenario in which young magnetars formed through core-collapse supernovae serve as the progenitors of FRBs. However, we estimate the local volumetric rate of FRB sources with energy above $10^{38}$ erg to be $2.3^{+2.4}_{-1.2} \times 10^5~\rm{Gpc}^{-3}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with previous results. This high volumetric rate means the core-collapse magnetar scenario alone cannot fully account for the observed population. Further theoretical efforts are required to explore alternative or additional progenitor channels for FRBs.</description>

      <title>Dissecting environmental effects with eccentric gravitational wave sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave (GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e&gt; 0.05$). We discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in unprecedented detail.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <title>Energy Reconstruction of Non-fiducial Electron-Positron Events in the DAMPE Experiment Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a space-based Cosmic-Ray (CR) observatory with the aim, among others, to study Cosmic-Ray Electrons (CREs) up to 10 TeV. Due to the low CRE rate at multi-TeV energies, we aim to increasing the acceptance by selecting events outside the fiducial volume. The complex topology of non-fiducial events requires the development of a novel energy reconstruction method. We propose the usage of Convolutional Neural Networks for a regression task to recover an accurate estimation of the initial energy.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.</description>
