      <title>Haag-Kastler stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an alternative implementation of the principle of general local covariance for algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs) which is more flexible and powerful than the original one by Brunetti, Fredenhagen and Verch. This is realized by considering the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK} : \mathbf{Loc}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$ which assigns to each Lorentzian manifold $M$ the category $\mathsf{HK}(M)$ of Haag-Kastler-style AQFTs over $M$ and to each embedding $f:M\to N$ a pullback functor $f^\ast = \mathsf{HK}(f) : \mathsf{HK}(N) \to \mathsf{HK}(M)$ restricting theories from $N$ to $M$. Locally covariant AQFTs are recovered as the points of the $2$-functor $\mathsf{HK}$. The main advantages of this new perspective are: 1.) It leads to technical simplifications, in particular with regard to the time-slice axiom, since global problems on $\mathbf{Loc}$ become families of simpler local problems on individual Lorentzian manifolds. 2.) Some aspects of the Haag-Kastler framework which previously got lost in locally covariant AQFT, such as a relative compactness condition on the open subsets in a Lorentzian manifold $M$, are reintroduced. 3.) It provides a successful and radically new perspective on descent conditions in AQFT, i.e. local-to-global conditions which allow one to recover a global AQFT on a Lorentzian manifold $M$ from its local data in an open cover $\{U_i \subseteq M\}$.</description>

      <title>Non-trivial fixed point of a $\psi^4_d$ fermionic theory, II. Anomalous exponent and scaling operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Renormalization Group (RG) fixed-point theory associated with a fermionic $\psi^4_d$ model in $d=1,2,3$ with fractional kinetic term, whose scaling dimension is fixed so that the quartic interaction is weakly relevant in the RG sense. The model is defined in terms of a Grassmann functional integral with interaction $V^*$, solving a fixed-point RG equation in the presence of external fields, and a fixed ultraviolet cutoff. We define and construct the field and density scale-invariant response functions, and prove that the critical exponent of the former is the naive one, while that of the latter is anomalous and analytic. We construct the corresponding (almost-)scaling operators, whose two point correlations are scale-invariant up to a remainder term, which decays like a stretched exponential at distances larger than the inverse of the ultraviolet cutoff. Our proof is based on constructive RG methods and, specifically, on a convergent tree expansion for the generating function of correlations, which generalizes the approach developed by three of the authors in a previous publication [A. Giuliani, V. Mastropietro, S. Rychkov, JHEP 01 (2021) 026].</description>

      <title>Scattering and Pairing by Exchange Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum interactions exchanging different types of particles play a pivotal r\^{o}le in quantum many-body theory, but they are not sufficiently investigated from a mathematical perspective. Here, we consider a system made of two fermions and one boson, in order to study the effect of such an off-diagonal interaction term, having in mind the physics of cuprate superconductors. Additionally, our model also includes a generalized Hubbard interaction (i.e., a general local repulsion term for the fermions). Regarding pairing, exponentially localized dressed bound fermion pairs are shown to exist and their effective dispersion relation is studied in detail. Scattering properties of the system are derived for two channels: the unbound and bound pair channels. We give particular attention to the regime of very large on-site (Hubbard) repulsions, because this situation is relevant for cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of building non-invertible quantum symmetries (as characterized by actions of unitary fusion categories) on noncommutative tori. We introduce a general method to construct actions of fusion categories on inductive limit C*-algberas using finite dimenionsal data, and then apply it to obtain AT-actions of arbitrary Haagerup-Izumi categories on noncommutative 2-tori, of the even part of the $E_{8}$ subfactor on a noncommutative 3-torus, and of $\text{PSU}(2)_{15}$ on a noncommutative 4-torus.</description>

      <title>Localisation without supersymmetry: towards exact results from Dirac structures in 3D $N = 0$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show, by introducing purely auxiliary gluinos and scalars, that the quantum path integral for a class of 3D interacting non-supersymmetric gauge theories localises. The theories in this class all admit a `Manin gauge theory' formulation, that we introduce; it is obtained by enhancing the gauge algebra of the theory to a Dirac structure inside a Manin pair. This machinery allows us to do localisation computations for every theory in this class at once, including for 3D Yang-Mills theory, and for its Third Way deformation; the latter calculation casts the Third Way path integral into an almost 1-loop exact form.</description>

      <title>Non-saturation of Bootstrap Bounds by Hyperbolic Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years the conformal bootstrap has produced surprisingly tight bounds on many non-perturbative CFTs. It is an open question whether such bounds are indeed saturated by these CFTs. A toy version of this question appears in a recent application of the conformal bootstrap to hyperbolic orbifolds, where one finds bounds on Laplace eigenvalues that are exceptionally close to saturation by explicit orbifolds. In some instances, the bounds agree with the actual values to 11 significant digits. In this work we show, under reasonable assumptions about the convergence of numerics, that these bounds are not in fact saturated. In doing so, we find formulas for the OPE coefficients of hyperbolic orbifolds, using links between them and the Rankin-Cohen brackets of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Symmetry fractionalization and duality defects in Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell theory on a non-spin manifold. Depending on the choice of statistics for line operators, there are three non-anomalous theories and one anomalous theory with different symmetry fractionalizations. We establish the gauging maps that connect the non-anomalous theories by coupling them to a discrete gauge theory. We also construct topological interfaces associated with $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ duality and gauging of electric and magnetic one-form symmetries. Finally, by stacking the topological interfaces, we compose various kinds of duality defects, which lead to non-invertible symmetries of non-spin Maxwell theories.</description>

      <title>Low temperature expansion for the Euclidean $\Phi^4_2$-measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic expansions of the Euclidean $\Phi^4_2$-measure in the low-temperature regime. In particular, this extends the asymptotic expansions of Gaussian function space integrals developed in Schilder (1966) and Ellis and Rosen (1982) to the singular setting, where the field is no longer a function, but just a distribution. As a consequence, we deduce limit theorems, specifically the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem for the $\Phi^4_2$-measure in the low-temperature limit.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Steps of CyclePopping in Weakly Inconsistent U(1)-Connection Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A U(1)-connection graph $G$ is a graph in which each oriented edge is endowed with a unit complex number, the latter being conjugated under orientation flip. We consider cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs), a particular kind of spanning subgraphs of $G$ that have recently found computational applications as randomized spectral sparsifiers. In this context, CRSFs are drawn from a determinantal measure. Under a condition on the connection, Kassel and Kenyon gave an elegant algorithm, named CyclePopping, to sample from this distribution. The algorithm is an extension of the celebrated algorithm of Wilson that uses a loop-erased random walk to sample uniform spanning trees. In this paper, we give an alternative, elementary proof of correctness of CyclePopping for CRSF sampling; we fill the gaps of a proof sketch by Kassel, who was himself inspired by Marchal's proof of the correctness of Wilson's original algorithm. One benefit of the full proof \`a la Marchal is that we obtain a concise expression for the law of the number of steps to complete the sampling procedure, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast. Furthermore, we show how to extend the proof to more general distributions over CRSFs, which are not determinantal. The correctness of CyclePopping is known even in the non-determinantal case from the work of Kassel and Kenyon, so our merit is only to provide an alternate proof. One interest of this alternate proof is again to provide the distribution of the time complexity of the algorithm, in terms of a Poisson point process on the graph loops, or equivalently as a Poisson process on pyramids of cycles, a combinatorial notion introduced by Viennot. Finally, we strive to make the connections to loop measures and combinatorial structures as explicit as possible, to provide a reference for future extensions of the algorithm and its analysis.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated Cartesian grid method is proposed for solving the heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations on irregular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a second-order method for solving general elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) on irregular domains using GPU acceleration, based on Ying's kernel-free boundary integral (KFBI) method. The method addresses limitations imposed by CFL conditions in explicit schemes and accuracy issues in fully implicit schemes for the Laplacian operator. To overcome these challenges, the paper employs a series of second-order time discrete schemes and splits the Laplacian operator into explicit and implicit components. Specifically, the Crank-Nicolson method discretizes the heat equation in the temporal dimension, while the implicit scheme is used for the wave equation. The Schrodinger equation is treated using the Strang splitting method. By discretizing the temporal dimension implicitly, the heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations are transformed into a sequence of elliptic equations. The Laplacian operator on the right-hand side of the elliptic equation is obtained from the numerical scheme rather than being discretized and corrected by the five-point difference method. A Cartesian grid-based KFBI method is employed to solve the resulting elliptic equations. GPU acceleration, achieved through a parallel Cartesian grid solver, enhances the computational efficiency by exploiting high degrees of parallelism. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves second-order accuracy for the heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations. Furthermore, the GPU-accelerated solvers for the three types of time-dependent equations exhibit a speedup of 30 times compared to CPU-based solvers.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the slip-length and on the Prandtl number, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems often present higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order networks, found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have been so far mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical principle to model and mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions often ignored, which can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>T-dualities in gauged linear sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe non-Abelian T-dualities for $\mathcal{N} = 2$ two dimensional gauged linear sigma model (GLSM). We start with the case of left and right $(2, 2)$ supersymmetry (SUSY), $U(1)$ gauge group, and global non-Abelian symmetries. Our analysis applies to the specialization of the GLSM with the global group $SU(2)\times SU(2)$, whose original model is the resolved conifold. We analyze the dual model and compute the periods on the dual geometry, matching the effective potential for the $U(1)$ gauge field, and discuss the coincident singularity at the conifold point. We further present the non-Abelian T-dualization of models with $(0,2)$ SUSY, analyzing the case of global symmetry $SU(2)$. In this case the full non-Abelian duality can be solved. The dual geometries with and without non-perturbative corrections to the superpotential coincide. The structure of the dual non-perturbative corrections employed are determined based on symmetry arguments. The non-Abelian T-dualities reviewed here lead to potential new symmetries between physical theories.</description>

      <title>Review on the matching conditions for the tidal problem: towards the application to more general contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal problem is used to obtain the tidal deformability (or Love number) of stars. The semi-analytical study is usually treated in perturbation theory as a first order perturbation problem over a spherically symmetric background configuration consisting of a stellar interior region matched across a boundary to a vacuum exterior region that models the tidal field. The field equations for the metric and matter perturbations at the interior and exterior regions are complemented with corresponding boundary conditions. The data of the two problems at the common boundary are related by the so called matching conditions. These conditions for the tidal problem are known in the contexts of perfect fluid stars and superfluid stars modelled by a two-fluid. Here we review the obtaining of the matching conditions for the tidal problem starting from a purely geometrical setting, and present them so that they can be readily applied to more general contexts, such as other types of matter fields, different multiple layers or phase transitions. As a guide on how to use the matching conditions, we recover the known results for perfect fluid and superfluid neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates centralizers and twisted centralizers in degenerate and non-degenerate Clifford (geometric) algebras. We provide an explicit form of the centralizers and twisted centralizers of the subspaces of fixed grades, subspaces determined by the grade involution and the reversion, and their direct sums. The results can be useful for applications of Clifford algebras in computer science, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split-step quantum walk operators can be expressed as a generalised version of CMV operators with complex transmission coefficients, which we call rotated CMV operators. Following the idea of Cantero, Moral and Velazquez's original construction of the original CMV operators from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle (OPUC), we show that rotated CMV operators can be constructed similarly via a rotated version of OPUCs with respect to the same measure, and admit an analogous LM-factorisation as the original CMV operators. We also develop the rotated second kind polynomials corresponding to the rotated OPUCs. We then use the LM-factorisation of rotated alternate CMV operators to compute the Gesztesy-Zinchenko transfer matrices for rotated CMV operators.</description>

      <title>Dually weighted multi-matrix models as a path to causal gravity-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a dually-weighted multi-matrix model that for a suitable choice of weights reproduce two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) coupled to the Ising model. When Ising degrees of freedom are removed, this model corresponds to the CDT-matrix model introduced by Benedetti and Henson [Phys. Lett. B 678, 222 (2009)]. We present exact as well as approximate results for the Gaussian averages of characters of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and $A^2$ for a given representation and establish the present limitations that prevent us to solve the model analytically. This sets the stage for the formulation of more sophisticated matter models coupled to two-dimensional CDT as dually weighted multi-matrix models providing a complementary view to the standard simplicial formulation of CDT-matter models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08842v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operators which are constructed from the $\lambda$-opers corresponding to solutions of the $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2$ Gaudin Bethe Ansatz equations. We define and study the connection coefficients called the $Q$-functions. We conjecture that the $Q$-functions obtained from the $\lambda$-opers coincide with the $Q$-functions of the Bazhanov-Lukyanov-Zamolodchikov opers with the monster potential related to the quantum KdV flows. We give supporting evidence for this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1902.01490v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct new families of symplectic capacities indexed by certain symmetric polynomials, defined using rational symplectic field theory. In particular, we introduce a sequence of capacities based on an L-infinity structure on linearized contact homology and rational curve counts with local tangency constraints. We prove various structural properties of these capacities and give some preliminary computations which show that they give state of the art symplectic embedding obstructions in basic examples.</description>

      <title>Density Matrix Formalism for PT-Symmetric Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the Lindblad Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.02445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of Lindblad decoherence, i.e. dissipative effects in an open quantum system due to interaction with an environment, we examine the transition probabilities between the eigenstates in the two-level quantum system described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with the Lindblad equation, for which the parity-time-reversal (PT) symmetry is conserved. First, the density matrix formalism for PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonian systems is developed. It is shown that the Lindblad operators $L^{}_j$ are pseudo-Hermitian, namely, $\eta L^{}_j \eta^{-1} = L^\dagger_j$ with $\eta$ being a linear and positive-definite metric, and respect the PT symmetry as well. We demonstrate that the generalized density matrix $\rho^{}_{\rm G}(t) \equiv \rho(t) \eta$, instead of the normalized density matrix $\rho^{}_{\rm N}(t) \equiv \rho(t)/{\rm tr}\left[\rho(t)\right]$, should be implemented for the calculation of the transition probabilities in accordance with the linearity requirement. Second, the density matrix formalism is used to derive the transition probabilities in general cases of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. In some concrete examples, we calculate compact analytical formulas for the transition probabilities and explore their main features with numerical illustrations. We also make a comparison between our present results and our previous ones using state vectors in the absence of Lindblad decoherence.</description>

      <title>The stringor bundle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set up a framework of 2-Hilbert bundles, which allows to rigorously define the "stringor bundle", a higher differential geometric object anticipated by Stolz and Teichner in an unpublished preprint about 20 years ago. Our framework includes an associated bundle construction, allowing us to associate a 2-Hilbert bundle with a principal 2-bundle and a unitary representation of its structure 2-group. We prove that the Stolz-Teichner stringor bundle is canonically isomorphic to the 2-Hilbert bundle obtained from applying our associated bundle construction to a string structure on a manifold and the stringor representation of the string 2-group that we discovered in earlier work. This establishes a perfect analogy to spin manifolds, representations of the spin groups, and spinor bundles.</description>

      <title>A Chiral ${\Lambda}$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ Symmetry of AdS$_4$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalising the chiral boundary conditions of $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$ gravity for AdS$_4$ gravity, we derive chiral locally AdS$_4$ solutions in the Newman-Unti gauge consistent with a variational principle whose asymptotic symmetry algebra we show, to be an infinite-dimensional chiral extension of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$. This symmetry algebra coincides with the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra in the flat space limit. We posit this symmetry algebra as the chiral version of recently discovered $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra. We postulate line integral charges from the bulk AdS$_4$ gravity corresponding to this chiral symmetry algebra and show that the charges obey the semi-classical limit of a $\mathcal{W}$-algebra that includes a level $\kappa$ Kac-Moody $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$ current algebra. Furthermore, using the standard tools of $2d$ CFT, we derive the quantum version of this $\mathcal{W}$-algebra which may be denoted by $\mathcal{W}(2;(3/2)^2,1^3)$.</description>

      <title>Approximation by the Bessel-Riesz Quotient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How large is the Bessel potential $G_{1,\mu}f$ compared to the Riesz potential $I_1f$ of a given function? We show that, for certain $f$ and $p$, \[\Vert G_{1,\mu} f\Vert_p\approx \omega(I_1f,1/\mu)_p,\] where $\omega(f,t)_p$ is the $L^p$ modulus of continuity. This estimates quantifies how the Bessel potential "fine tunes" the Riesz potential. It is obtained by studying the quotient of the two operators, $E_\mu=\frac{\sqrt{-\Delta}}{\sqrt{\mu^2-\Delta}}$, and exploiting its approximation theoretic properties. We also derive pointwise estimates for the kernel of $E_\mu$ which imply localization type results.</description>

      <title>Semi-Riemannian manifolds with linear differential conditions on the curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-Riemannian manifolds that satisfy (homogeneous) linear differential conditions of arbitrary order on the curvature are analyzed. They include, in particular, the spaces with (higher-order) recurrent curvature, (higher-order) symmetric spaces, as well as entire new families of semi-Riemannian manifolds rarely, or never, considered before in the literature --such as the spaces whose derivative of the Riemann tensor field is recurrent, among many others. Definite proof that all types of such spaces do exist is provided by exhibiting explicit examples of all possibilities in all signatures, except in the Riemannian case with a positive definite metric. Several techniques of independent interest are collected and presented. Of special relevance is the case of Lorentzian manifolds, due to its connection to the physics of the gravitational field. This connection is discussed with particular emphasis on Gauss-Bonnet gravity and in relation with Penrose limits. Many new lines of research open up and a handful of conjectures, based on the results found hitherto, is put forward.</description>

      <title>A near-optimal zero-free disk for the Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The partition function of the Ising model of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G;b)=\sum_{\sigma:V\to \{0,1\}} b^{m(\sigma)}$, where $m(\sigma)$ denotes the number of edges $e=\{u,v\}$ such that $\sigma(u)=\sigma(v)$. We show that for any positive integer $\Delta$ and any graph $G$ of maximum degree at most $\Delta$, $Z_{\text{Ising}}(G;b)\neq 0$ for all $b\in \mathbb{C}$ satisfying $|\frac{b-1}{b+1}| \leq \frac{1-o_\Delta(1)}{\Delta-1}$ (where $o_\Delta(1) \to 0$ as $\Delta\to \infty$). This is optimal in the sense that $\tfrac{1-o_\Delta(1)}{\Delta-1}$ cannot be replaced by $\tfrac{c}{\Delta-1}$ for any constant $c &gt; 1$ subject to a complexity theoretic assumption.
  To prove our result we use a standard reformulation of the partition function of the Ising model as the generating function of even sets. We establish a zero-free disk for this generating function inspired by techniques from statistical physics on partition functions of a polymer models. Our approach is quite general and we discuss extensions of it to a certain types of polymer models.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a coherent definition of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism higher category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define a reflection-positive topological quantum field theory to be a higher dagger functor from $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$ to some target higher dagger category $\mathcal{C}$. Our definitions have a tunable parameter: a group $G$ acting on the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}$ of $(\infty,n)$-categories. Different choices for $G$ accommodate different flavours of higher dagger structure; the universal choice is $G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}) = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$, which implements dagger involutions on all levels of morphisms. The Stratified Cobordism Hypothesis suggests that there should be a map $\mathrm{PL}(n) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)})$, where $\mathrm{PL}(n)$ is the group of piecewise-linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}$ the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories with all adjoints; we conjecture more strongly that $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}) \cong \mathrm{PL}(n)$. Based on this conjecture we propose a notion of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category with unitary duality or $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger category. We outline how to construct a $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger structure on the fully-extended bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_n^X$ for any stable tangential structure $X$; our outline restricts to a rigorous construction of a coherent dagger structure on the unextended bordism $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n,n-1}^X$. The article is a report on the results of a workshop held in Summer 2023, and is intended as a sketch of the big picture and an invitation for more thorough development.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which leads to thermalization under certain conditions on the initial states. These conditions, however, are sensitive to the precise formulation of the hypothesis. In this work, we focus on the important case of low entanglement initial states, which are operationally accessible in many natural physical settings, including experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation. We prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution, we define a random energy smoothing on local Hamiltonians that leads to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such a transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under generic smoothness conditions on the spectrum, the short-time dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This paper delves into classical multiple orthogonal polynomials with an arbitrary number of weights, including Jacobi-Pi\~neiro, Laguerre of both first and second kinds, as well as multiple orthogonal Hermite polynomials. Novel explicit expressions for nearest-neighbor recurrence coefficients, as well as the step line case, are provided for all these polynomial families. Furthermore, new explicit expressions for type I multiple orthogonal polynomials are derived for Laguerre of the second kind and also for multiple Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>The coproduct for the affine Yangian and the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the coproduct and evaluation map for the affine Yangian and the Miura map for non-rectangular $W$-algebras, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which is an affine analogue of the one given in De Sole-Kac-Valeri. As a consequence, we find that the coproduct for the affine Yangian is compatible with the parabolic induction for non-rectangular $W$-algebras via this homomorphism. We also show that the image of this homomorphism is contained in the affine coset of the $W$-algebra in the special case that the $W$-algebra is associated with a nilpotent element of type $(1^{m-n},2^n)$.</description>
