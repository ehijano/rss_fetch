      <title>Probe position determination with multichannel I-V measurements in a two-dimensional sheet$\colon$ Computational method and mathematical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin films and surfaces exhibit many distinctive two-dimensional electronic properties that are absent in bulk crystals. In situ microscale multi-probe measurements have been utilized as an effective method to identify the electrical conductivity of such thin films and surfaces. Precise determination of multi-probe positions is crucial for accurate characterization of the conductance. However, traditional methods that use microscopes for determining multi-probe positions often impose significant constraints on experimental setups. In some cases, installing a microscope is not even feasible. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel method to determine probe positions using electrical signals from the probes. This method enables precise determination of probe positions using a reference sheet and reference probes, even at low or high temperatures and under ultra-high vacuum or high-pressure conditions. The proposed method simplifies the integration of microscale multi-probe measurement systems into various devices, thereby advancing research on thin films and surfaces.</description>

      <title>A simple method for deriving the birdcage coil magnetic field with experimental validation at 4 T, 7 T and 15.2 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy rely on the magnetic fields generated by radiofrequency volume coils to acquire high-quality data. Consequently, a comprehensive understanding of electromagnetic field behavior in RF volume coils is essential for optimizing imaging techniques and designing advanced coils. This study introduces a theoretical model for the magnetic field generated by a birdcage coil, based on a spherical geometry approach. To validate the proposed model, phantom images were acquired at different resonant frequencies, and the magnetic field produced by the RF coil was compared with experimental data. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the theoretical model, offering valuable insights into the behavior of electromagnetic fields in RF coils. This study provides a promising framework for further analysis and development of RF coil design, with significant implications for advancing both MRI and spectroscopy technologies.</description>

      <title>(111) Si spin qubits constructed on L point of band structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (001) Si spin qubits are being intensively studied because they have structures similar to that of CMOS devices currently being produced, and thus have the advantage of utilizing state-of-the-art miniaturization, integration, and variation-reduction-technologies. However, there are still issues, such as further improvement of relaxation and decoherence time, stabilization of valley-splitting control, and reduction of the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. In this study, new measures are proposed to address these three issues. Instead of confining an electron to the minimum energy point $X_0$ of the conduction band along the band structure $\Gamma-\Delta-X$ in (001) Si crystals, we propose confining an electron to the L point along $\Gamma-\Lambda-L$ in (111) Si crystals. At the $X_0$ point, the symmetry causes spin-orbit interaction to act on the electron, and the sixfold degeneracy is lifted into a fourfold and a twofold, and the valley-splitting of the twofold conflicts with the two-level system. In the symmetry of the $L$ point, substantial spin polarization disappears, facilitating the reduction of the spin-orbit interaction, and the fourfold degeneracy is lifted to threefold and single, and the single becomes ground state. The need to increase the magnitude of the valley-splitting is exempt, allowing the electron to be controlled away from the interface, which is expected to reduce the variation caused by the roughness of the interface. Data on the confinement of an electron to the $L$ point and the control of fourfold degeneracy are needed, and it is hoped that prototype silicon spin qubits constructed on (111) Si crystals will be developed and that the proposed device structure will help implement quantum computers based on Si devices.</description>

      <title>Computational Studies of NaVTe Half Heusler Alloy for Green Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To lessen the quick depletion of fossil fuels and the resulting environmental harm, it is necessary to investigate effective and eco-friendly materials that can convert lost energy into electricity. The structural, optical, electronic, thermo-electric, and thermodynamic properties of the novel half-Heusler (HH) material NaVTe were examined in the current work using density functional theory (DFT). The Birch-Murnaghan equations of states were used to confirm the structural stability of the NaVTe HH alloy under investigation. These equations show that the compound in question has structural stability because its ground-state energy levels are negative. For spin-down configurations, NaVTe possesses an energy band gap of 3.2 eV, according to band structure and total density of state analysis. NaVTe is a material that is desirable for optoelectronic applications due to its optical features, which include maximum conductivity and absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The figure of merit and other thermodynamic and thermoelectric parameters are calculated. According to these predicted outcomes, the NaVTe HH alloy would be the ideal option for thermo-electric and renewable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Small polarons mediated near-room-temperature metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide and their hopping dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers pursuing advanced photoelectric devices have discovered near room-temperature metal-insulator transitions (MIT) in non-volatile VO2. Despite theoretical investigations suggesting that polaron dynamics mediate the MIT, direct experimental evidence remains scarce. In this study, we present direct evidence of the polaron state in insulating VO2 through high-resolution spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements and first-principles calculations. We illustrate the complementary role of polaron dynamics in facilitating Peierls and Mott transitions, thereby contributing to the MIT processes. Furthermore, our observations and characterizations of conventional metallic and correlated plasmons in the respective phases of the VO2 film offer valuable insights into their electron structures. This investigation enhances comprehension of the MIT mechanism in correlated systems and underscores the roles of polarons, lattice distortions, and electron correlations in facilitating phase transition processes in strongly-correlated systems. Additionally, the detailed detection of small polarons and plasmons serves as inspiration for the development of new device functionalities.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal metasurfaces with epsilon-near-zero materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal optics enables asymmetric transmission of light when its sources and detectors are exchanged. A canonical example -- optical isolator -- enables light propagation in only one direction, similar to how electrical diodes enable unidirectional flow of electric current. Nonreciprocal optics today, unlike nonreciprocal electronics, remains bulky. Recently, nonlinear metasurfaces opened up a pathway to strong optical nonreciprocity at the nanoscale. However, demonstrations to date were based on optically slow nonlinearities involving thermal effects or phase transition materials. In this work, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal metasurface with an ultra-fast optical response based on indium tin oxide in its epsilon-near-zero regime. It operates in the spectral range of 1200-1300 nm with incident power densities of 40-70 GW/cm$^2$. Furthermore, the nonreciprocity of the metasurface extends to both amplitude and phase of the forward/backward transmission opening a pathway to nonreciprocal wavefront control at the nanoscale.</description>
