      <title>Meromorphic Convexity on Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of meromorphic convexity is defined and studied on complex manifolds. Using this notion, in analogy with Stein manifolds, a new class of complex manifolds, called {\calligra M }-manifolds, is introduced. This is a class of complex manifolds with a good supply of global meromorphic functions, in particular, it includes all Stein manifolds and projective manifolds. It is also shown that there exist noncompact complex manifolds, known as long $\mathbb C^2$, that are {\calligra M }-manifolds but do not contain any nonconstant holomorphic functions.</description>

      <title>Quantitative correspondence between quasi-symmetric mappings on complete metric spaces and rough quasi-isometric mappings on their hyperbolic fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a quantitative correspondence between power quasi-symmetric mappings on complete metric spaces and rough quasi-isometric mappings on their hyperbolic fillings. In particular, we prove that the exponents in the power quasi-symmetric mappings coincide with the coefficients in the rough quasi-isometric mappings. This shows that the obtained correspondence is both sharp and consistent. In this way, we generalize the corresponding result by Bj\"orn, Bj\"orn, Gill, and Shanmugalingam (J. Reine Angew. Math., 2017) from the setting of rooted trees to that of hyperbolic fillings.</description>

      <title>From pathological to paradigmatic: A retrospective on Eremenko and Lyubich's entire functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article surveys the impact of Eremenko and Lyubich's paper ''Examples of entire functions with pathological dynamics'', published in 1987 in the Journal of the LMS. Through a clever extension and use of classical approximation theorems, the authors constructed examples exhibiting behaviours previously unseen in holomorphic dynamics. Their work laid foundational techniques and posed questions that have since guided a good part of the development of transcendental dynamics.</description>

      <title>$m$-Pseudo-effectivity and a Monge-Amp\`ere-Type Equation for Forms of Positive Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an $n$-dimensional compact K\"ahler manifold, we continue our study of $m$-positivity in two ways. We first propose generalisations of the notions of pseudo-effective and big Bott-Chern cohomology classes of bidegree $(1,\,1)$ by relaxing the standard positivity hypotheses to their $m$-counterparts after we have proved a Lamari-type duality lemma in bidegree $(m,\,m)$. Independently, we propose a Monge-Amp\`ere-type non-linear pde whose distinctive feature is that its solutions, if any, are forms of positive degree rather than functions. We prove a form of uniqueness for the solutions and, under the assumption that a solution exists, we give a geometric application involving the $m$-bigness notion introduced in the first part.</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes an asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$ in a general non-Gaussian setting. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmic decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>
