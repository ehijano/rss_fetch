      <title>Market-Based Asset Price Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider volume weighted average price (VWAP) as the 1st market-based statistical moment and derive the dependence of higher statistical moments of price on statistical moments and correlations of the values and volumes of market trades. If all trade volumes are constant during the averaging interval, then the market-based statistical moments equal the frequency-based. We approximate market-based probability of price by a finite number of statistical moments. The use of VWAP results in zero price-volume correlations. We derive the expressions of market-based correlations between prices and squares of trade volumes and between squares of prices and volumes. To forecast market-based averages and volatility of asset prices, one should predict two statistical moments and the correlation of their trade values and volumes. We explain how that limits the number of predicted statistical moments of prices by the first two and limits the accuracy of the forecasts of the probability of asset prices by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the accuracy and reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like those developed by BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of asset prices.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Probability of Stock Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the dependence of market-based statistical moments of returns on statistical moments and correlations of the current and past trade values. We use Markowitz's definition of value weighted return of a portfolio as the definition of market-based average return of trades during the averaging period. Then we derive the dependence of market-based volatility and higher statistical moments of returns on statistical moments, volatilities, and correlations of the current and past trade values. We derive the approximations of the characteristic function and the probability of returns by a finite number q of market-based statistical moments. To forecast market-based average and volatility of returns at horizon T, one should predict the first two statistical moments and correlation of current and past trade values at the same horizon. We discuss the economic reasons that limit the number of predicted statistical moments of returns by the first two. That limits the accuracy of the forecasts of probability of returns by the accuracy of the Gaussian approximations. To improve the reliability of large macroeconomic and market models like BlackRock's Aladdin, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed., the developers should use market-based statistical moments of returns.</description>
