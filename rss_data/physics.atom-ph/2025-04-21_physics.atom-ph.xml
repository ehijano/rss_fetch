      <title>Unconventional Chemical Bonding of Lanthanide-OH Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the low lying adiabatic relativistic electronic states of lanthanide monohydroxide (Ln-OH) molecules near their linear equilibrium geometries. We focus on heavy, magnetic DyOH and ErOH relevant to fundamental symmetry tests. We use a restricted-active-space self-consistent field method combined with spin-orbit coupling as well as a relativistic coupled-cluster method. In addition, electric dipole and magnetic moments are computed with the self-consistent field method. Analysis of the results from both methods shows that the dominant molecular configuration of the ground state is one where an electron from the partially filled and submerged 4f orbital of the lanthanide atom moves to the hydroxyl group, leaving the closed outer-most 6s$^2$ lone electron pair of the lanthanide atom intact in sharp contrast to the bonding in alkaline-earth monohydroxides and YbOH, where an electron from the outer-most s shell moves to the hydroxyl group. For linear molecules the projection of the total electron angular momentum on the symmetry axis is a conserved quantity with quantum number $\Omega$ and we study the polynomial $\Omega$ dependence of the energies of the ground states as well as their electric and magnetic moments. We find that the lowest energy states have $|\Omega|=15/2$ and 1/2 for DyOH and ErOH, respectively. The zero field splittings among these $\Omega$ states is approximately $hc\times 1\,000$~cm$^{-1}$. We find that the permanent dipole moments for both triatomics are fairly small at 0.23 atomic units. The magnetic moments are closely related to that of the corresponding atomic Ln$^+$ ion in an excited electronic state. We also realize that the total electron angular momentum is to good approximation conserved and has a quantum number of 15/2 for both triatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>High precision spectroscopy of trilobite Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform three-photon photoassociation to obtain high resolution spectra of $^{87}$Rb trilobite dimers for the principal quantum numbers $n = 22,24,25,26$, and $27$. The large binding energy of the molecules in combination with a relative spectroscopic resolution of $10^{-4}$ provides a rigorous benchmark for existing theoretical models. A recently developed Green's function framework, which circumvents the convergence issues that afflicted previous studies,, is employed to theoretically reproduce the vibrational spectrum of the molecule with high accuracy. The relatively large molecular binding energy are primarily determined by the low energy $S$-wave electron-atom scattering length, thereby allowing us to extract the $^3S_1$ scattering phase shift with unprecedented accuracy, at low energy regimes inaccessible to free electrons.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Calculations of Electric Dipole Polarizabilities in the Li, Na and K Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out first-principle calculations of scalar and tensor components of the static electric dipole polarizabilities of six low-lying states of lithium (Li), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) alkali atoms in the linear response approach. Results are compared from the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) method, third-order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT(3) method), random phase approximation (RPA) and singles and doubles approximated relativistic coupled-cluster theory (RCCSD method). We find the DHF and RPA results are close to each other, while the MBPT(3) and RCCSD results are close to each other. This suggests that pair-correlation effects play significant roles over core-polarization effects to determine these quantities accurately in the above alkali atoms. We also compare contributions arising through the core, core-valence and valence correlations through all the methods in Li, Na and K, which show that the core-valence contributions are negligibly small in all the methods and there is no particular trends of the core and valence correlation contributions with the size of the atom. Uncertainties to the RCCSD results are estimated to quote the final values, and they are compared with the previous calculations and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally highly excited trilobite molecules stabilized by non-adiabatic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the observation of highly excited ($\nu \sim 100)$ vibrational states of a trilobite ultralong-range Rydberg molecule in $^{87}$Rb. These states manifest spectroscopically in a regularly spaced series of peaks red-detuned from the $25f_{7/2}$ dissociation threshold. The existence and observed stability of these states requires the almost complete suppression of the adiabatic decay pathway induced by the $P$-wave shape resonance of Rb. This stabilization is predicted to occur only for certain Rydberg levels where the avoided crossing between trilobite and $P$-wave dominated butterfly potential energy curves nearly vanishes, allowing the vibrational states to diabatically traverse the crossing with almost unit probability. This is the first direct measurement of beyond-Born-Oppenheimer physics in long-range Rydberg molecules, and paves the way for future experiments to access and manipulate wavepackets formed from high-lying vibrational states.</description>

      <title>On damping of Rabi oscillations in two-photon Raman excitation in cold $^{87}$Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon Raman excitation between the ground hyperfine states $|5 \ ^2S_{1/2}, F = 2\rangle$ and $|5 \ ^2S_{1/2}, F = 1\rangle$ of $^{87}$Rb atom has been experimentally studied. The Rabi coupling strengths of various transition involved have been calculated in presence of a weak magnetic field. A density matrix formalism has been developed to understand the experimentally observed damping of Rabi oscillations of population in a hyperfine state of $^{87}$Rb atom during interaction with the Raman laser beams. The observed damping of Rabi oscillations has been attributed to the dephasing during the light atom interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunnelling without a barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunneling is an iconic concept that captures the peculiarity of quantum dynamics but, despite its ubiquity, questions remain. We focus on strong-field tunneling, which is vital to all attosecond science. We find an unexpected optical tunneling event that happens when the instantaneous electric field vanishes and there is no barrier. This event arises from a color switchover in a strongly polychromatic field. The tunneling without a barrier reveals the disconnect between the standard intuition built on the picture of a quasistatic barrier and the nonadiabatic nature of the process.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model on a neutral atom quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using the Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm on a neutral atom quantum computer. We test the ground-state energy of spin systems with up to 15 spins. Two different encoding schemes are used: an individual spin encoding where each spin is represented by one qubit, and an efficient Gray code encoding scheme which only requires a number of qubits that scales with the logarithm of the number of spins. This more efficient encoding, together with zero noise extrapolation techniques, is shown to improve the fidelity of the simulated energies with respect to exact solutions.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced quantum nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chirality, nonreciprocity, and quantum correlations are at the center of a wide range of intriguing effects and applications across natural sciences and emerging quantum technologies. However, the direct link combining these three essential concepts has remained unknown till now. Here, we establish a chiral non-Hermitian platform with flying atoms and demonstrate chirality-induced nonreciprocal bipartite quantum correlations between two channels: Quantum correlation emerges when two spatially separated light beams of the same polarization propagate in opposite directions in the atomic cloud, and it becomes zero when they travel in the same direction. Thus, just by flipping the propagation direction of one of the beams while keeping its polarization the same as the other beam, we can create or annihilate quantum correlations between two channels. We also show that this nonreciprocal quantum correlation can be extended to multi-color sidebands with Floquet engineering. Our findings may pave the road for realizing one-way quantum effects, such as nonreciprocal squeezing or entanglement, with a variety of chiral devices, for the emerging applications of e.g., directional quantum network or nonreciprocal quantum metrology.</description>
