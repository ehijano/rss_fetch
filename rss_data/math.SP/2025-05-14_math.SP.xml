      <title>Inverse problem for semi-infinite Jacobi matrices and associated Hilbert spaces of analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamic problems for the discrete systems with discrete time associated with finite and semi-infinite Jacobi matrices. The result of the paper is a procedure of association of special Hilbert spaces of functions, namely de Branges space, playing an important role in the inverse spectral theory, with these systems. %Thus the procedure, offered by the authors in the %previous papers now is extended to the case of semi-infinite %Jacobi matrices. We point out the relationships with the classical moment problems theory and compare properties of classical Hankel matrices associated with moment problems with properties of matrices of connecting operators associated with dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap with polynomial rate for random covering surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we show that the recent work of Magee, Puder and van Handel [MPvH25] can be applied to obtain an optimal spectral gap result with polynomial error rate for uniformly random covers of closed hyperbolic surfaces. Let $X$ be a closed hyperbolic surface. We show there exists $b,c&gt;0$ such that a uniformly random degree-$n$ cover $X_{n}$ of $X$ has no new Laplacian eigenvalues below $\frac{1}{4}-cn^{-b}$ with probability tending to $1$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Connected signed graphs with given inertia indices and given girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $\Gamma=(G, \sigma)$ is a connected signed graph with at least one cycle. The number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ are called positive inertia index, negative inertia index and nullity of $\Gamma$, which are denoted by $i_+(\Gamma)$, $i_-(\Gamma)$ and $\eta(\Gamma)$, respectively. Denoted by $g$ the girth, which is the length of the shortest cycle of $\Gamma$. We study relationships between the girth and the negative inertia index of $\Gamma$ in this article. We prove $i_{-}(\Gamma)\geq \lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil-1$ and extremal signed graphs corresponding to the lower bound are characterized. Furthermore, the signed graph $\Gamma$ with $i_{-}(\Gamma)=\lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil$ for $g\geq 4$ are given. As a by-product, the connected signed graphs with given positive inertia index, nullity and given girth are also determined, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Spectra of Sieved Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a family of examples of discrete Schr\"odinger operators whose spectral dimension is not invariant under sieving. The examples are produced from the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, which is one of the main models of a one-dimensional quasicrystal. We also give a family of examples in which the local Hausdorff dimension tends to zero in some parts of the spectrum as the sieving parameter is sent to infinity.</description>

      <title>Extremising eigenvalues of the GJMS operators in a fixed conformal class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$. If $s$ is a positive integer satisfying $2s&lt;n$, we let $P_g^s$ be the GJMS operator of order $2s$ in $M$. We investigate in this paper the extremal values taken by fixed eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ as $h$ runs though the whole conformal class $[g]$. Due to the conformal covariance of $P_g^s$ we need only consider two variational problems: maximising negative eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ and minimising positive eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ when $h \in [g]$. These extremal values are conformal invariants of $(M,g)$ and optimisers for these problems, when they exist, are known to not be smooth metrics in general. To overcome this we define and investigate eigenvalues for singular conformal metrics, that we call \emph{generalised eigenvalues}. We develop a new variational framework for renormalised eigenvalues of any index over the set of admissible (singular) conformal factors: we obtain semi-continuity results and Euler-Lagrange equations for local extremals. Using this framework we prove, under mild assumptions on $(M,g)$ and $s$, several new (non)-existence results for extremals of renormalised eigenvalues over $[g]$. These include, among other results, a maximisation result for negative eigenvalues, the minimisation of the principal eigenvalue of $P_g^s$ and the analysis of several invariants of the round sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n, g_0)$. We also establish a strong connection between the existence of optimisers and (nodal) solutions of prescribed $Q$-curvature equations. Our analysis covers the case of any order $s \ge 1$ and allows $P_g^s$ to have kernel. When $s=1$ and $P_g^1$ is the conformal Laplacian, this problem was previously investigated when $k=1, 2$. Our work strongly generalises previous results to eigenvalues of any index.</description>

      <title>Unified approach to classical equations of inverse problem theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary control (BC-) method is an approach to inverse problems based upon their deep relations to control and system theory. We show that the classical integral equations of inverse problem theory (Gelfand-Levitan, Krein and Marchenko equations) can be derived in the framework of the BC-method in a unified way. Namely, to solve each of these equations is in fact to solve a relevant boundary control problem, whereas its solution is determined by the inverse data.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequality with zero magnetic field in doubly connected domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the lowest eigenvalue of a magnetic Laplacian depends on the geometry of a planar domain with a disk shaped hole, where the magnetic field is generated by a singular flux. Under Dirichlet boundary conditions on the inner boundary and Neumann boundary conditions on the outer boundary, we show that this eigenvalue is maximized when the domain is an annulus, for a fixed area and magnetic flux. As consequences, we establish geometric inequalities for eigenvalues in settings with both singular and localized magnetic fields. We also propose a conjecture for a general optimality result and establish its validity for large magnetic fluxes.</description>
