      <title>Concurrency Constrained Scheduling with Tree-Like Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates concurrency-constrained scheduling problems, where the objective is to construct a schedule for a set of jobs subject to concurrency restrictions. Formally, we are given a conflict graph $G$ defined over a set of $n$ jobs, where an edge between two jobs in $G$ indicates that these jobs cannot be executed concurrently. Each job may have distinct attributes, such as processing time, due date, weight, and release time. The goal is to determine a schedule that optimizes a specified scheduling criterion while adhering to all concurrency constraints. This framework offers a versatile model for analyzing resource allocation problems where processes compete for shared resources, such as access to shared memory. From a theoretical perspective, it encompasses several classical graph coloring problems, including Chromatic Number, Sum Coloring, and Interval Chromatic Number.
  Given that even the simplest concurrency-constrained scheduling problems are NP-hard for general conflict graphs, this study focuses on conflict graphs with bounded treewidth. Our results establish a dichotomy: Some problems in this setting can be solved in FPT time, while others are shown to be XALP-complete for treewidth as parameter. Along the way, we generalize several previously known results on coloring problems for bounded treewidth graphs. Several of the FPT algorithms are based on the insight that completion times are bounded by the Grundy number of the conflict graph - the fact that this number is bounded by the product of treewidth and the logarithm of the number of vertices then leads to the FPT time bound.</description>

      <title>Elimination Distance to Dominated Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Dominated Cluster Deletion problem we are given an undirected graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $d$ and the question is to decide whether there exists a set of at most $k$ vertices whose removal results in a graph in which each connected component has a dominating set of size at most $d$. In the Elimination Distance to Dominated Clusters problem we are again given an undirected graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $d$ and the question is to decide whether we can recursively delete vertices up to depth $k$ such that each remaining connected component has a dominating set of size at most $d$. Bentert et al.~[Bentert et al., MFCS 2024] recently provided an almost complete classification of the parameterized complexity of Dominated Cluster Deletion with respect to the parameters $k$, $d$, $c$, and $\Delta$, where $c$ and $\Delta$ are the degeneracy, and the maximum degree of the input graph, respectively. In particular, they provided a non-uniform algorithm with running time $f(k,d)\cdot n^{O(d)}$. They left as an open problem whether the problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter $k+d+c$. We provide a uniform algorithm running in time $f(k,d)\cdot n^{O(d)}$ for both Dominated Cluster Deletion and Elimination Distance to Dominated Clusters. We furthermore show that both problems are FPT when parameterized by $k+d+\ell$, where $\ell$ is the semi-ladder index of the input graph, a parameter that is upper bounded and may be much smaller than the degeneracy $c$, positively answering the open question of Bentert et al. We almost complete the picture by providing an almost full classification for the parameterized complexity and kernelization complexity of Elimination Distance to Dominated Clusters. The one difficult base case that remains open is whether treedepth (the case $d=0$) is NP-hard on graphs of bounded maximum degree.</description>

      <title>Normality of 8-Bit Bent Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bent functions are Boolean functions in an even number of variables that are indicators of Hadamard difference sets in elementary abelian 2-groups. A bent function in m variables is said to be normal if it is constant on an affine space of dimension m/2. In this paper, we demonstrate that all bent functions in m = 8 variables -- whose exact count, determined by Langevin and Leander (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 59(1--3): 193--205, 2011), is approximately $2^106$ share a common algebraic property: every 8-variable bent function is normal, up to the addition of a linear function. With this result, we complete the analysis of the normality of bent functions for the last unresolvedcase, m= 8. It is already known that all bent functions in m variables are normal for m &lt;= 6, while for m &gt; = 10, there exist bent functions that cannot be made normal by adding linear functions. Consequently, we provide a complete solution to an open problem by Charpin (J. Complex. 20(2-3): 245-265, 2004)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any positive integers $g$ and $t$, there is a $K_{6}^{(1)}$-induced-minor-free graph of girth at least $g$ that is not a region intersection graph over the class of $K_t$-minor-free graphs. This answers in a strong form the recently raised question of whether for every graph $H$ there is a graph $H'$ such that $H$-induced-minor-free graphs are region intersection graphs over $H'$-minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decomposition of Forman-Ricci Curvature on Vietoris-Rips Complexes and Data Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Forman-Ricci curvature (FRC) is an efficient tool that characterizes essential geometrical features and associated transitions of real-world networks, extending seamlessly to higher-dimensional computations in simplicial complexes. In this article, we provide two major advancements: First, we give a decomposition for FRC, enabling local computations of FRC. Second, we construct a set-theoretical proof enabling an efficient algorithm for the local computation of FRC in Vietoris-Rips (VR) complexes.Strikingly, this approach reveals critical information and geometric insights often overlooked by conventional classification techniques. Our findings open new avenues for geometric computations in VR complexes and highlight an essential yet under-explored aspect of data classification: the geometry underpinning statistical patterns.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Weighted Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several resource allocation settings involve agents with unequal entitlements represented by weights. We analyze weighted fair division from an asymptotic perspective: if $m$ items are divided among $n$ agents whose utilities are independently sampled from a probability distribution, when is it likely that a fair allocation exist? We show that if the ratio between the weights is bounded, a weighted envy-free allocation exists with high probability provided that $m = \Omega(n\log n/\log\log n)$, generalizing a prior unweighted result. For weighted proportionality, we establish a sharp threshold of $m = n/(1-\mu)$ for the transition from non-existence to existence, where $\mu\in (0,1)$ denotes the mean of the distribution. In addition, we prove that for two agents, a weighted envy-free (and weighted proportional) allocation is likely to exist if $m = \omega(\sqrt{r})$, where $r$ denotes the ratio between the two weights.</description>

      <title>Token Sliding Reconfiguration on DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and two independent sets of same size, the Independent Set Reconfiguration Problem under token sliding ask whether one can, in a step by step manner, transform the first independent set into the second one. In each step we must preserve the condition of independence. Further, referring to solution vertices as tokens, we are only permitted to slide a token along an edge. Until the recent work of Ito et al. [Ito et al. MFCS 2022] this problem was only considered on undirected graphs. In this work, we study reconfiguration under token sliding focusing on DAGs.
  We present a complete dichotomy of intractability in regard to the depth of the DAG, by proving that this problem is NP-complete for DAGs of depth 3 and $\textrm{W}[1]$-hard for depth 4 when parameterized by the number of tokens $k$, and that these bounds are tight. Further, we prove that it is fixed parameter tractable on DAGs parameterized by the combination of treewidth and $k$. We show that this result applies to undirected graphs, when the number of times a token can visit a vertex is restricted.</description>

      <title>The frequency $K_i$s for symmetrical traveling salesman problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The frequency $K_i$s ($i\in[4,n]$) are studied for symmetrical traveling salesman problem ($TSP$) to identify the edges in optimal Hamiltonian cycle ($OHC$). A frequency $K_i$ is computed with a sort of ${{i}\choose{2}}$ optimal $i$-vertex paths with given endpoints (optimal $i$-vertex path) in a corresponding $K_i$ in $K_n$. In frequency $K_i$, the frequency of an edge is the number of the optimal $i$-vertex paths containing the edge in the corresponding $K_i$. Given an $OHC$ edge related to $K_i$, it has a frequency bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the corresponding frequency $K_i$, and that of an ordinary edge not in $OHC$ is smaller than $\frac{i+2}{2}$. On average, an $OHC$ edge in $K_i$ has a frequency bigger than $\frac{i^2-4i+7}{2}$ whereas an ordinary edge has a frequency smaller than 2. Moreover, given a frequency $K_i$ containing an $OHC$ edge related to $K_n$, the frequency of the $OHC$ edge is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ in the worst average case. It implies that the average frequency of an $OHC$ edge computed with frequency $K_i$s is bigger than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$. It also found that the probability that an $OHC$ edge is contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths keeps stable or increases according to $i\in [4, n]$. As the frequency $K_i$s are used to compute the frequency of an edge, each $OHC$ edge has its own peak frequency at $i=P_0$ where $P_0=\frac{n}{2} + 2$ for even $n$ or $\frac{n+1}{2} + 1$ for odd $n$. For ordinary edges out of $OHC$, the probability that they are contained in optimal $i$-vertex paths decreases according to $i$. Moreover, the average frequency of an ordinary edge will be smaller than $\frac{1}{2}{{i}\choose{2}}$ if $i \geq [0.3660n + 1.5849]$. Based on these findings, an algorithm is presented to find $OHC$ in $O(n^62^{0.3660n})$ time using dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14\%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>On Supports for graphs of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{E})$ be a hypergraph. A support is a graph $Q$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the elements in $E$ is connected. We consider the problem of constructing a support for hypergraphs defined by connected subgraphs of a host graph. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of connected subgraphs of $G$. Let the vertices of $G$ be partitioned into two sets the \emph{terminals} $\mathbf{b}(V)$ and the \emph{non-terminals} $\mathbf{r}(V)$. We define a hypergraph on $\mathbf{b}(V)$, where each $H\in\mathcal{H}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the vertices of $\mathbf{b}(V)$ in $H$.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a support for the \emph{dual hypergraph} - a hypergraph on $\mathcal{H}$ where each $v\in \mathbf{b}(V)$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $v$. In fact, we construct supports for a common generalization of the primal and dual settings called the \emph{intersection hypergraph}.
  As our main result, we show that if the host graph $G$ has bounded genus and the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy a condition of being \emph{cross-free}, then there exists a support that also has bounded genus. Our results are a generalization of the results of Raman and Ray (Rajiv Raman, Saurabh Ray: Constructing Planar Support for Non-Piercing Regions. Discret. Comput. Geom. 64(3): 1098-1122 (2020)).
  Our techniques imply a unified analysis for packing and covering problems for hypergraphs defined on surfaces of bounded genus. We also describe applications of our results for hypergraph colorings.</description>
