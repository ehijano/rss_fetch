      <title>Comparing Self-Disclosure Themes and Semantics to a Human, a Robot, and a Disembodied Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As social robots and other artificial agents become more conversationally capable, it is important to understand whether the content and meaning of self-disclosure towards these agents changes depending on the agent's embodiment. In this study, we analysed conversational data from three controlled experiments in which participants self-disclosed to a human, a humanoid social robot, and a disembodied conversational agent. Using sentence embeddings and clustering, we identified themes in participants' disclosures, which were then labelled and explained by a large language model. We subsequently assessed whether these themes and the underlying semantic structure of the disclosures varied by agent embodiment. Our findings reveal strong consistency: thematic distributions did not significantly differ across embodiments, and semantic similarity analyses showed that disclosures were expressed in highly comparable ways. These results suggest that while embodiment may influence human behaviour in human-robot and human-agent interactions, people tend to maintain a consistent thematic focus and semantic structure in their disclosures, whether speaking to humans or artificial interlocutors.</description>

      <title>User-Centered Insights into Assistive Navigation Technologies for Individuals with Visual Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigational challenges significantly impact the independence and mobility of Individuals with Visual Impairment (IVI). While numerous assistive technologies exist, their adoption remains limited due to usability challenges, financial constraints, and a lack of alignment with user needs. This study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining structured surveys and virtual workshops with 19 IVI to investigate their experiences, needs, and preferences regarding assistive technologies for navigation and daily living. The survey results provide insights into participants technological competence, preferences for assistive devices, and willingness to adopt new solutions. In parallel, workshop discussions offer qualitative perspectives on key navigation challenges, including difficulties in detecting overhead obstacles, navigating environments with complex layout, and the limitations of existing technologies. Findings highlight the need for assistive devices that integrate both navigational guidance and high-level spatial awareness, allowing users to build mental maps of their surroundings. Additionally, multimodal feedback, combining audio, haptic, and tactile cues, emerges as a crucial feature to accommodate diverse user preferences and environmental conditions. The study also underscores financial and training barriers that limit access to advanced assistive technologies. Based on these insights, we recommend the development of customizable, user-friendly, and most importantly affordable navigation aids that align with the daily needs of IVI. The findings from this study provide guidance for technology developers, researchers, and policymakers working toward more inclusive and effective assistive solutions.</description>

      <title>Towards Intelligent VR Training: A Physiological Adaptation Framework for Cognitive Load and Stress Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Virtual Reality (VR) systems have the potential to enhance training and learning experiences by dynamically responding to users' cognitive states. This research investigates how eye tracking and heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to detect cognitive load and stress in VR environments, enabling real-time adaptation. The study follows a three-phase approach: (1) conducting a user study with the Stroop task to label cognitive load data and train machine learning models to detect high cognitive load, (2) fine-tuning these models with new users and integrating them into an adaptive VR system that dynamically adjusts training difficulty based on physiological signals, and (3) developing a privacy-aware approach to detect high cognitive load and compare this with the adaptive VR in Phase two. This research contributes to affective computing and adaptive VR using physiological sensing, with applications in education, training, and healthcare. Future work will explore scalability, real-time inference optimization, and ethical considerations in physiological adaptive VR.</description>

      <title>Towards Holistic Prompt Craft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an account of an ongoing practice-based Design Research programme that explores the interaction affordances of real-time AI image generators. Based on our experiences from three installations, we reflect on the design of PromptJ, a user interface built around the concept of a prompt mixer. Our first contribution is a series of strong concepts based on our reflections of designing and deploying PromptJ. We cohere and abstract our strong concepts into the notion of Holistic Prompt Craft, which describes the importance of considering all relevant parameters concurrently. Finally, we present PromptTank, a prototype design which exemplifies the principles of Holistic Prompt Craft. Our contributions are articulated as strong concepts or intermediate knowledge that are intended to inform and inspire practitioners and researchers who are designing with image generation models or developing novel interaction paradigms for generative AI systems more generally.</description>

      <title>Can dialogues with AI systems help humans better discern visual misinformation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread emergence of manipulated news media content poses significant challenges to online information integrity. This study investigates whether dialogues with AI about AI-generated images and associated news statements can increase human discernment abilities and foster short-term learning in detecting misinformation. We conducted a study with 80 participants who engaged in structured dialogues with an AI system about news headline-image pairs, generating 1,310 human-AI dialogue exchanges. Results show that AI interaction significantly boosts participants' accuracy in identifying real versus fake news content from approximately 60\% to 90\% (p$&lt;$0.001). However, these improvements do not persist when participants are presented with new, unseen image-statement pairs without AI assistance, with accuracy returning to baseline levels (~60\%, p=0.88). These findings suggest that while AI systems can effectively change immediate beliefs about specific content through persuasive dialogue, they may not produce lasting improvements that transfer to novel examples, highlighting the need for developing more effective interventions that promote durable learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Winding Path of Learning: Exploring Affective, Cognitive, and Action-Oriented Prompts for Communication Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since high dropout rates in online learning platforms were reported, various factors affecting learner retention have been identified, with learners' perceptions of their experiences playing a crucial role in shaping their persistence. For instance, Kittur et al. highlight how success expectations are shaped by perceived system fit and course difficulty.
  Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) present new possibilities for GenAI-mediated learning. AI-generated instructional messages are often perceived as clearer than human-written content, but their impact on learners' perceptions of skill-building experiences remains underexplored.
  This study examines GenAI-mediated learning in a self-directed context, focusing on communication skills. We compare three messaging styles - Affective, Cognitive, and Action-Oriented - to investigate their influence on learners' perceptions of the learning process. We applied this approach to ten instructional units, using GenAI to generate 30 learning items. Three evaluators assessed them for desirability and appropriateness through numerical ratings and open-ended feedback. The 180 excerpts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis, revealing four overarching themes: Prerequisite Common Ground, Intrinsic Value, User Responses, and Expressed Preferences.
  We discuss these insights to inform the design of GenAI-mediated, self-directed skill-building, with the goal of enhancing engagement, persistence, and learning outcomes.</description>

      <title>AI, Help Me Think$\unicode{x2014}$but for Myself: Assisting People in Complex Decision-Making by Providing Different Kinds of Cognitive Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we design AI tools that effectively support human decision-making by complementing and enhancing users' reasoning processes? Common recommendation-centric approaches face challenges such as inappropriate reliance or a lack of integration with users' decision-making processes. Here, we explore an alternative interaction model in which the AI outputs build upon users' own decision-making rationales. We compare this approach, which we call ExtendAI, with a recommendation-based AI. Participants in our mixed-methods user study interacted with both AIs as part of an investment decision-making task. We found that the AIs had different impacts, with ExtendAI integrating better into the decision-making process and people's own thinking and leading to slightly better outcomes. RecommendAI was able to provide more novel insights while requiring less cognitive effort. We discuss the implications of these and other findings along with three tensions of AI-assisted decision-making which our study revealed.</description>

      <title>Assessing employment and labour issues implicated by using AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter critiques the dominant reductionist approach in AI and work studies, which isolates tasks and skills as replaceable components. Instead, it advocates for a systemic perspective that emphasizes the interdependence of tasks, roles, and workplace contexts. Two complementary approaches are proposed: an ethnographic, context-rich method that highlights how AI reconfigures work environments and expertise; and a relational task-based analysis that bridges micro-level work descriptions with macro-level labor trends. The authors argue that effective AI impact assessments must go beyond predicting automation rates to include ethical, well-being, and expertise-related questions. Drawing on empirical case studies, they demonstrate how AI reshapes human-technology relations, professional roles, and tacit knowledge practices. The chapter concludes by calling for a human-centric, holistic framework that guides organizational and policy decisions, balancing technological possibilities with social desirability and sustainability of work.</description>

      <title>Human Trust in AI Search: A Large-Scale Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power generative search engines which, in turn, drive human information seeking and decision making at scale. The extent to which humans trust generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can therefore influence what we buy, how we vote and our health. Unfortunately, no work establishes the causal effect of generative search designs on human trust. Here we execute ~12,000 search queries across seven countries, generating ~80,000 real-time GenAI and traditional search results, to understand the extent of current global exposure to GenAI search. We then use a preregistered, randomized experiment on a large study sample representative of the U.S. population to show that while participants trust GenAI search less than traditional search on average, reference links and citations significantly increase trust in GenAI, even when those links and citations are incorrect or hallucinated. Uncertainty highlighting, which reveals GenAI's confidence in its own conclusions, makes us less willing to trust and share generative information whether that confidence is high or low. Positive social feedback increases trust in GenAI while negative feedback reduces trust. These results imply that GenAI designs can increase trust in inaccurate and hallucinated information and reduce trust when GenAI's certainty is made explicit. Trust in GenAI varies by topic and with users' demographics, education, industry employment and GenAI experience, revealing which sub-populations are most vulnerable to GenAI misrepresentations. Trust, in turn, predicts behavior, as those who trust GenAI more click more and spend less time evaluating GenAI search results. These findings suggest directions for GenAI design to safely and productively address the AI "trust gap."</description>

      <title>Classifying Subjective Time Perception in a Multi-robot Control Scenario Using Eye-tracking Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As automation and mobile robotics reshape work environments, rising expectations for productivity increase cognitive demands on human operators, leading to potential stress and cognitive overload. Accurately assessing an operator's mental state is critical for maintaining performance and well-being. We use subjective time perception, which can be altered by stress and cognitive load, as a sensitive, low-latency indicator of well-being and cognitive strain. Distortions in time perception can affect decision-making, reaction times, and overall task effectiveness, making it a valuable metric for adaptive human-swarm interaction systems.
  We study how human physiological signals can be used to estimate a person's subjective time perception in a human-swarm interaction scenario as example. A human operator needs to guide and control a swarm of small mobile robots. We obtain eye-tracking data that is classified for subjective time perception based on questionnaire data. Our results show that we successfully estimate a person's time perception from eye-tracking data. The approach can profit from individual-based pretraining using only 30 seconds of data. In future work, we aim for robots that respond to human operator needs by automatically classifying physiological data in a closed control loop.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Interaction Framework for Efficient Human-Robot Collaborative Shelf Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing presence of service robots in human-centric environments, such as warehouses, demands seamless and intuitive human-robot collaboration. In this paper, we propose a collaborative shelf-picking framework that combines multimodal interaction, physics-based reasoning, and task division for enhanced human-robot teamwork.
  The framework enables the robot to recognize human pointing gestures, interpret verbal cues and voice commands, and communicate through visual and auditory feedback. Moreover, it is powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) which utilizes Chain of Thought (CoT) and a physics-based simulation engine for safely retrieving cluttered stacks of boxes on shelves, relationship graph for sub-task generation, extraction sequence planning and decision making. Furthermore, we validate the framework through real-world shelf picking experiments such as 1) Gesture-Guided Box Extraction, 2) Collaborative Shelf Clearing and 3) Collaborative Stability Assistance.</description>

      <title>Setup-Invariant Augmented Reality for Teaching by Demonstration with Surgical Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) is an effective tool in robotic surgery education as it combines exploratory learning with three-dimensional guidance. However, existing AR systems require expert supervision and do not account for differences in the mentor and mentee robot configurations. To enable novices to train outside the operating room while receiving expert-informed guidance, we present dV-STEAR: an open-source system that plays back task-aligned expert demonstrations without assuming identical setup joint positions between expert and novice. Pose estimation was rigorously quantified, showing a registration error of 3.86 (SD=2.01)mm. In a user study (N=24), dV-STEAR significantly improved novice performance on tasks from the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery. In a single-handed ring-over-wire task, dV-STEAR increased completion speed (p=0.03) and reduced collision time (p=0.01) compared to dry-lab training alone. During a pick-and-place task, it improved success rates (p=0.004). Across both tasks, participants using dV-STEAR exhibited significantly more balanced hand use and reported lower frustration levels. This work presents a novel educational tool implemented on the da Vinci Research Kit, demonstrates its effectiveness in teaching novices, and builds the foundation for further AR integration into robot-assisted surgery.</description>

      <title>Ice-Breakers, Turn-Takers and Fun-Makers: Exploring Robots for Groups with Teenagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Successful, enjoyable group interactions are important in public and personal contexts, especially for teenagers whose peer groups are important for self-identity and self-esteem. Social robots seemingly have the potential to positively shape group interactions, but it seems difficult to effect such impact by designing robot behaviors solely based on related (human interaction) literature. In this article, we take a user-centered approach to explore how teenagers envisage a social robot "group assistant". We engaged 16 teenagers in focus groups, interviews, and robot testing to capture their views and reflections about robots for groups. Over the course of a two-week summer school, participants co-designed the action space for such a robot and experienced working with/wizarding it for 10+ hours. This experience further altered and deepened their insights into using robots as group assistants. We report results regarding teenagers' views on the applicability and use of a robot group assistant, how these expectations evolved throughout the study, and their repeat interactions with the robot. Our results indicate that each group moves on a spectrum of need for the robot, reflected in use of the robot more (or less) for ice-breaking, turn-taking, and fun-making as the situation demanded.</description>

      <title>Visualisation of a multidimensional point cloud as a 3D swarm of avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article presents an innovative approach to the visualisation of multidimensional data, using icons inspired by Chernoff faces. The approach merges classical projection techniques with the assignment of particular data dimensions to mimic features, capitalizing on the natural ability of the human brain to interpret facial expressions. The technique is implemented as a plugin to the dpVision open-source image handling platform. The plugin allows the data to be interactively explored in the form of a swarm of "totems" whose position in hyperspace as well as facial features represent various aspects of the data. Sample visualisations, based on synthetic test data as well as the vinhoverde 15-dimensional database on Portuguese wines, confirm the usefulness of our approach to the analysis of complex data structures.</description>

Abstract: Social media platforms face heightened risks during major political events; yet, how platforms adapt their moderation practices in response remains unclear. The Digital Services Act Transparency Database offers an unprecedented opportunity to systematically study content moderation at scale, enabling researchers and policymakers to assess platforms' compliance and effectiveness. Herein, we analyze 1.58 billion self-reported moderation actions taken by eight large social media platforms during an extended period of eight months surrounding the 2024 European Parliament elections. Our findings reveal a lack of adaptation in moderation strategies, as platforms did not exhibit significant changes in their enforcement behaviors surrounding the elections. This raises concerns about whether platforms adapted their moderation practices at all, or if structural limitations of the database concealed possible adjustments. Moreover, we found that noted transparency and accountability issues persist nearly a year after initial concerns were raised. These results highlight the limitations of current self-regulatory approaches and underscore the need for stronger enforcement and data access mechanisms to ensure that online platforms uphold their responsibility in safeguarding democratic processes.</description>

      <title>Neural Signal Compression using RAMAN tinyML Accelerator for BCI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality, multi-channel neural recording is indispensable for neuroscience research and clinical applications. Large-scale brain recordings often produce vast amounts of data that must be wirelessly transmitted for subsequent offline analysis and decoding, especially in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) utilizing high-density intracortical recordings with hundreds or thousands of electrodes. However, transmitting raw neural data presents significant challenges due to limited communication bandwidth and resultant excessive heating. To address this challenge, we propose a neural signal compression scheme utilizing Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs), which achieves a compression ratio of up to 150 for compressing local field potentials (LFPs). The CAE encoder section is implemented on RAMAN, an energy-efficient tinyML accelerator designed for edge computing, and subsequently deployed on an Efinix Ti60 FPGA with 37.3k LUTs and 8.6k register utilization. RAMAN leverages sparsity in activation and weights through zero skipping, gating, and weight compression techniques. Additionally, we employ hardware-software co-optimization by pruning CAE encoder model parameters using a hardware-aware balanced stochastic pruning strategy, resolving workload imbalance issues and eliminating indexing overhead to reduce parameter storage requirements by up to 32.4%. Using the proposed compact depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder (DS-CAE) model, the compressed neural data from RAMAN is reconstructed offline with superior signal-to-noise and distortion ratios (SNDR) of 22.6 dB and 27.4 dB, along with R2 scores of 0.81 and 0.94, respectively, evaluated on two monkey neural recordings.</description>

      <title>Leveraging GCN-based Action Recognition for Teleoperation in Daily Activity Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caregiving of older adults is an urgent global challenge, with many older adults preferring to age in place rather than enter residential care. However, providing adequate home-based assistance remains difficult, particularly in geographically vast regions. Teleoperated robots offer a promising solution, but conventional motion-mapping teleoperation imposes unnatural movement constraints on operators, leading to muscle fatigue and reduced usability. This paper presents a novel teleoperation framework that leverages action recognition to enable intuitive remote robot control. Using our simplified Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (S-ST-GCN), the system recognizes human actions and executes corresponding preset robot trajectories, eliminating the need for direct motion synchronization. A finite-state machine (FSM) is integrated to enhance reliability by filtering out misclassified actions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework enables effortless operator movement while ensuring accurate robot execution. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of teleoperation with action recognition for enabling caregivers to remotely assist older adults during activities of daily living (ADLs). Future work will focus on improving the S-ST-GCN's recognition accuracy and generalization, integrating advanced motion planning techniques to further enhance robotic autonomy in older adult care, and conducting a user study to evaluate the system's telepresence and ease of control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emotions, shaped by past experiences, significantly influence decision-making and goal pursuit. Traditional cognitive-behavioral techniques for personal development rely on mental imagery to envision ideal selves, but may be less effective for individuals who struggle with visualization. This paper introduces Emotional Self-Voice (ESV), a novel system combining emotionally expressive language models and voice cloning technologies to render customized responses in the user's own voice. We investigate the potential of ESV to nudge individuals towards their ideal selves in a study with 60 participants. Across all three conditions (ESV, text-only, and mental imagination), we observed an increase in resilience, confidence, motivation, and goal commitment, and the ESV condition was perceived as uniquely engaging and personalized. We discuss the implications of designing generated self-voice systems as a personalized behavioral intervention for different scenarios.</description>

      <title>SpeechCap: Leveraging Playful Impact Captions to Facilitate Interpersonal Communication in Social Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social Virtual Reality (VR) emerges as a promising platform bringing immersive, interactive, and engaging mechanisms for collaborative activities in virtual spaces. However, interpersonal communication in social VR is still limited with existing mediums and channels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method for mediating real-time conversation in social VR, which uses impact captions, a type of typographic visual effect widely used in videos, to convey both verbal and non-verbal information. We first investigated the design space of impact captions by content analysis and a co-design session with four experts. Next, we implemented SpeechCap as a proof-of-concept system, with which users can communicate with each other using speech-driven impact captions in VR. Through a user study (n=14), we evaluated the effectiveness of the visual and interaction design of impact captions, highlighting the interactivity and the integration of verbal and non-verbal information in communication mediums. Finally, we discussed topics of visual rhetoric, interactivity, and ambiguity as the main findings from the study, and further provided design implications for future work for facilitating interpersonal communication in social VR.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of Scalable Content Annotation Using Multi-LLM Consensus and Human Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content annotation at scale remains challenging, requiring substantial human expertise and effort. This paper presents a case study in code documentation analysis, where we explore the balance between automation efficiency and annotation accuracy. We present MCHR (Multi-LLM Consensus with Human Review), a novel semi-automated framework that enhances annotation scalability through the systematic integration of multiple LLMs and targeted human review. Our framework introduces a structured consensus-building mechanism among LLMs and an adaptive review protocol that strategically engages human expertise. Through our case study, we demonstrate that MCHR reduces annotation time by 32% to 100% compared to manual annotation while maintaining high accuracy (85.5% to 98%) across different difficulty levels, from basic binary classification to challenging open-set scenarios.</description>

      <title>User-Centered AI for Data Exploration: Rethinking GenAI's Role in Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in GenAI have enabled automation in data visualization, allowing users to generate visual representations using natural language. However, existing systems primarily focus on automation, overlooking users' varying expertise levels and analytical needs. In this position paper, we advocate for a shift toward adaptive GenAI-driven visualization tools that tailor interactions, reasoning, and visualizations to individual users. We first review existing automation-focused approaches and highlight their limitations. We then introduce methods for assessing user expertise, as well as key open challenges and research questions that must be addressed to allow for an adaptive approach. Finally, we present our vision for a user-centered system that leverages GenAI not only for automation but as an intelligent collaborator in visual data exploration. Our perspective contributes to the broader discussion on designing GenAI-based systems that enhance human cognition by dynamically adapting to the user, ultimately advancing toward systems that promote augmented cognition.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Human-AI Teaming: A Review and Outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, with clear potential to enhance decision-making and productivity. Yet, the collaborative decision-making process between humans and AI remains underdeveloped, often falling short of its transformative possibilities. This paper explores the evolution of AI agents from passive tools to active collaborators in human-AI teams, emphasizing their ability to learn, adapt, and operate autonomously in complex environments. This paradigm shifts challenges traditional team dynamics, requiring new interaction protocols, delegation strategies, and responsibility distribution frameworks. Drawing on Team Situation Awareness (SA) theory, we identify two critical gaps in current human-AI teaming research: the difficulty of aligning AI agents with human values and objectives, and the underutilization of AI's capabilities as genuine team members. Addressing these gaps, we propose a structured research outlook centered on four key aspects of human-AI teaming: formulation, coordination, maintenance, and training. Our framework highlights the importance of shared mental models, trust-building, conflict resolution, and skill adaptation for effective teaming. Furthermore, we discuss the unique challenges posed by varying team compositions, goals, and complexities. This paper provides a foundational agenda for future research and practical design of sustainable, high-performing human-AI teams.</description>

      <title>Automating Customer Needs Analysis: A Comparative Study of Large Language Models in the Travel Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many tasks, such as extracting valuable insights from vast amounts of textual data. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of LLMs for the extraction of travel customer needs from TripAdvisor and Reddit posts. Leveraging a diverse range of models, including both open-source and proprietary ones such as GPT-4 and Gemini, we aim to elucidate their strengths and weaknesses in this specialized domain. Through an evaluation process involving metrics such as BERTScore, ROUGE, and BLEU, we assess the performance of each model in accurately identifying and summarizing customer needs. Our findings highlight the efficacy of opensource LLMs, particularly Mistral 7B, in achieving comparable performance to larger closed models while offering affordability and customization benefits. Additionally, we underscore the importance of considering factors such as model size, resource requirements, and performance metrics when selecting the most suitable LLM for customer needs analysis tasks. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights for businesses seeking to leverage advanced NLP techniques to enhance customer experience and drive operational efficiency in the travel industry.</description>

      <title>Human and LLM Biases in Hate Speech Annotations: A Socio-Demographic Analysis of Annotators and Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07991v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of online platforms exacerbated the spread of hate speech, demanding scalable and effective detection. However, the accuracy of hate speech detection systems heavily relies on human-labeled data, which is inherently susceptible to biases. While previous work has examined the issue, the interplay between the characteristics of the annotator and those of the target of the hate are still unexplored. We fill this gap by leveraging an extensive dataset with rich socio-demographic information of both annotators and targets, uncovering how human biases manifest in relation to the target's attributes. Our analysis surfaces the presence of widespread biases, which we quantitatively describe and characterize based on their intensity and prevalence, revealing marked differences. Furthermore, we compare human biases with those exhibited by persona-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that while persona-based LLMs do exhibit biases, these differ significantly from those of human annotators. Overall, our work offers new and nuanced results on human biases in hate speech annotations, as well as fresh insights into the design of AI-driven hate speech detection systems.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test: A Critical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the recent publication "ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test" by Restrepo Echavarr\'ia (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.</description>
