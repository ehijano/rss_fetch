      <title>Accelerating Instanton Theory with the Line Integral String Method, Gaussian Process Regression, and Selective Hessian Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Gaussian process regression enhanced line integral string method to accelerate ring polymer instanton calculations of tunneling rates and tunneling splittings in molecular proton transfer reactions. By exploiting uncertainty estimates from the surrogate representation, we show that the number of force evaluations required to converge an instanton path becomes effectively independent of the number of beads used to discretize the pathway. To reduce the computational overhead associated with training, particularly when Hessian information is included, we implement graphics processing unit accelerated black box matrix matrix multiplication, achieving an order of magnitude speedups relative to standard implementations. For rate calculations, we introduce a selective Hessian training strategy that distinguishes flexible modes strongly coupled to the transferring proton from more rigid modes weakly coupled to the reaction coordinate. This enables the construction of accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with substantially fewer Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal demonstrate that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations. The approach is further extended to tunneling splitting calculations for the formic acid dimer and malonaldehyde, yielding splittings in reasonable agreement with experiment and high level theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic tensor contraction for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Vibrational infrared and Raman spectra of the methanol molecule with equivariant neural-network property surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric dipole and polarizability surfaces are developed for the methanol molecule using {\it ab initio} electronic structure data, computed at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, and equivariant neural networks. These property surfaces are used to compute vibrational infrared and Raman intensities up to the OH stretching fundamental vibration. The intensity computations use the vibrational energies and wave functions obtained in continued variational vibrational computations from earlier work [J. Chem. Phys. 163, 064101 (2025)]. The vibrational representation accounts for the large-amplitude torsion and uses curvilinear normal coordinates for the small-amplitude modes, allowing truncation of the vibrational basis set and the integration grid.</description>

      <title>Semi-Local Exchange-Correlation Approximations in Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density functional theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure calculations, with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and machine learning. At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.
  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.
  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous radiation chemistry emerges through ultrafast proton transfer and ion-radical formation
  with unexplored energy-redistribution dynamics steering the subsequent reactions. We performed
  time-resolved disruptive probing on pure water dimer, (H$_2$O)$_2$, to disentangle the post-ionization
  reactions. Through kinetic-energy-resolved ion imaging, we unraveled the dynamics in the (H$_2$O)$_2^+$
  ground state: at low-energy ($\sim$0.05 eV) ultrafast proton transfer ($\sim$19 fs) is
  followed by H$_3$O$^+$+OH fragmentation ($\sim$360~fs). At higher energies, proton
  transfer becomes hindered ($\sim$60 fs) while the subsequent fragmentation becomes faster
  ($\sim$210 fs), evolving into coupled dynamics ($&gt;0.15$ eV, $\sim$100 fs). Moreover, we
  observed H$_2$O)$_2^+$ stabilization proceeding through a Zundel-like structure. This reveals how
  ion-radical formation in ionized hydrogen-bonded networks shapes reactivity in aqueous dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ghost Embedding Bridging Chemistry and One-Body Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological rules play a central role in the design of chemical reactions and materials with targeted properties. Typically, these are formulated heuristically in terms of non-interacting orbitals and bands, yet show remarkable accuracy in predicting the complex behavior of intrinsically interacting many-body systems. While their non-interacting formulation makes them easy to interpret, it potentially hinders the development of new rules for systems governed by strong correlation, such as transition metal-based materials. In this work, we present a rigorous framework that allows bridging between fully interacting, even strongly correlated, systems and an effective one-body picture in terms of quasiparticles. Further, we present a computational strategy to efficiently and accurately access the main components of such a description: the embedding approximation of the ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz. We illustrate the capabilities of this quasiparticle formulation on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and apply their reformulated version to toy ``reactions'' which exemplify the main scenarios covered by them.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Synthetic Impurities Affect Glyphosate Solubility and Crystal Growth Using Free Energy Calculations and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>Extended phase-space symplectic integration for electron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom by comparing different modes of implementation of extended phase space integration.</description>

      <title>SeQuant Framework for Symbolic and Numerical Tensor Algebra. I. Core Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SeQuant is an open-source library for symbolic algebra of tensors over commutative (scalar) and non-commutative (operator) rings. The key innovation supporting most of its functionality is a graph-theoretic tensor network (TN) canonicalizer that can handle tensor networks with symmetries faster than their standard group-theoretic counterparts. The TN canonicalizer is used for routine simplification of conventional tensor expressions, for optimizing application of Wick's theorem (used to canonicalize products of tensors over operator fields), and for manipulation of the intermediate representation leading to the numerical evaluation. Notable features of SeQuant include support for noncovariant tensor networks (which often arise from tensor decompositions) and for tensors with modes that depend parametrically on indices of other tensor modes (such dependencies between degrees of freedom are naturally viewed as nesting of tensors, "tensors of tensors" arising in block-wise data compressions in data science and modern quantum simulation). SeQuant blurs the line between pure symbolic manipulation/code generation and numerical evaluation by including compiler-like components to optimize and directly interpret tensor expressions using external numerical tensor algebra frameworks. The SeQuant source code is available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant.</description>

      <title>The geometric control of boundary-catalytic branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of the geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to catalytic branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on absorbing regions of the boundary. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction in a bounded domain. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics, chemistry, and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt% and 50 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;ulti-binding &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;ites &lt;b&gt;U&lt;/b&gt;nited in &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;ovalent-&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rganic &lt;b&gt;F&lt;/b&gt;ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (FeCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt% and 72.6 g H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/L at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15-20 kJ/mol) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.</description>
