      <title>Explicit Families of Spinor Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a recipe for building explicit representations of the real Clifford algebras once an explicit family is given in dimensions $1$ through $4$. We further give an explicit construction of spin coordinate systems for a given real spinor module and use it to explicitly compute the parallel transport of spinor fields. We further highlight some novelties such as the relationship with the spectrum of the spinor Dirac operator and the Hodge de Rham operator when a parallel spinor field exists and a brief discussion of spinors along a hypersurface in $\bR^4$. Lastly, we extend our construction to arbitrary signature quadratic forms thus providing a complete and explicit family of spinor representations for all mixed signature Clifford algberas. We show that in all cases the spinor representations can be expressed as tensor products of multi-vectors over the fields $\bR$, $\bC$, and $\bH$.</description>

      <title>Volume growth of horospheres in diagonalizable Heintze groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the volume growth of horospheres in a Heintze group of the form R ___ A R d with A a diagonal derivation. We conclude that the isometry and quasi-isometry classes of horospheres (with their intrinsic geometry) coincide. Furthermore, if A is not a scalar multiple of the identity, then there are exactly two such classes, characterized by their volume growth, which we calculate explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify that LA-Courant algebroids provide the Manin triple framework for double Lie bialgebroids. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between double Lie bialgebroids and LA-Manin triples, i.e., LA-Courant algebroids equipped with a pair of complementary LA-Dirac structures. This work sheds light on the infinitesimal-global correspondence between LA-Courant algebroids and multiplicative Courant algebroids.</description>

      <title>Existence proofs for rotationally symmetric translating solutions to mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There exist rotationally symmetric translating solutions to mean curvature flow that can be written as a graph over Euclidean space. This result is well-known. Its proof uses the symmetry and techniques from partial differential equations. However, the result can also be formulated as an existence result for a singular ordinary differential equation. Here, we provide different methods to prove existence of these solutions based on the study of the singular ordinary differential equation without using methods from partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Cancellation properties for exotic $4$-dimensional positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruberman constructed families $\{g_n\vert n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathcal{R}^+ (M)$ of metrics of positive scalar curvature on certain $4$-manifolds which are concordant but lie in different path components of $\mathcal{R}^+ (M)$. We prove a cancellation result along the following lines. For each closed manifold $N$, there is a map $\nu_N: \mathcal{R}^+ (M) \to \mathcal{R}^+ (M \times N)$, well-defined up to homotopy, that takes the product with $N$. We prove that when $N$ has positive dimension $\nu_N$ takes all metrics of Ruberman's family to the same path component. This is trivial when $N$ has a psc metric and follows from pseudoisotopy theory when $\dim (N) \geq 3$. Our proof is cobordism theoretic in nature and also applies to $\dim(N) =1,2$. The proof relies on rigidity properties for the action of the diffeomorphism group on $\mathcal{R}^+(L)$ for high-dimensional $N$ and a calculation of $\pi_1(\mathrm{MTSO(4)})$ that we also carry out.
  Recently, Auckly and Ruberman exhibited examples of elements in higher homotopy groups of $\mathcal{R}^+(M^4)$ for certain $M$. Using the same method, we also prove that these elements lie in the kernel of the induced map $(\nu_N)_*$ on rational homotopy.</description>

      <title>On geometric spectral functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spectral functionals associated with Dirac and Laplace-type differential operators on manifolds, defined via the Wodzicki residue, extending classical results for Dirac operators derived from the Levi-Civita connection to geometries with torsion. The local densities of these functionals recover fundamental geometric tensors, including the volume form, Riemannian metric, scalar curvature, Einstein tensor, and torsion tensor. Additionally, we introduce chiral spectral functionals using a grading operator, which yields novel spectral invariants. These constructions offer a richer spectral-geometric characterization of manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of deformations of quasi-Hamiltonian $G$-spaces to Hamiltonian $G$-spaces and provide several examples. In particular, we show that the double $G \times G$ of a Lie group, viewed as a quasi-Hamiltonian $G \times G$-space, deforms smoothly to the cotangent bundle $T^*G$. Likewise, any conjugacy class of $G$ sufficiently close to the identity deforms to a coadjoint orbit. We further show that the moduli space of flat $G$-connections on a compact oriented surface with boundaries deforms to $T^*G^n$ for some $n$.</description>

      <title>Rotation angles of a rotating disc -- A toy model exhibiting the geometric phase --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a simple kinematic model, which is a rotating disc on the edge of another fixed disc without slipping, and study the rotation angle of the rotating disc. The rotation angle consists of two parts, the dynamical phase $\Delta_d$ and the geometric phase $\Delta_g$. The former is a dynamical rotation of the disc itself, and the geometric motion of the disc characterizes the latter. In fact, $\Delta_g$ is regarded as the geometric phase appearing in several important contexts in physics. The clue to finding the explicit form of $\Delta_g$ is the Baumkuchen lemma, which we called. Due to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, in the case that the rotating disc comes back to the initial position, $\Delta_g$ is interpreted as the signed area of a two-sphere enclosed by the trajectory of the Gauss vector, which is a unit normal vector on the moving disc. We also comment on typical models sharing the common underlying structure, which include Foucault's pendulum, Dirac's monopole potentials, and Berry phase. Hence, our model is a very simple but distinguished one in the sense that it embodies the essential concepts in differential geometry and theoretical physics such as the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the geometric phase, and the fiber bundles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometric Theory of Principal Bundle Constrained Systems: Strong Transversality Conditions and Variational Framework for Gauge Field Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric mechanics framework for constrained systems on principal bundles. Our key innovation is the development and rigorous characterization of the strong transversality condition that establishes a fundamental connection between constraint distributions and principal bundle structures through a Lie algebra dual distribution function $\lambda: P \to \mathfrak{g}^*$. We prove this condition is equivalent to a $G$-equivariant splitting of the Atiyah exact sequence. We establish the theoretical foundation by proving both existence theorems (for principal bundles satisfying $\text{ad}^*\Omega\lambda = 0$ with parallelizable base manifolds) and uniqueness theorems (for semi-simple Lie algebras with trivial centers). From variational principles, we derive the dynamic connection equation $\partial_t\omega = d^{\omega}\eta - \iota_{X_H}\Omega$, which reveals interaction mechanisms between gauge fields and matter fields in constrained systems. Our work introduces the Spencer cohomology mapping and proves its isomorphism with de Rham cohomology of the principal bundle, creating an exact correspondence between topological invariants and physical conservation laws. Through Zorn's lemma, we provide constructive proof of hierarchical fibrization, explaining topological mechanisms of constraint structure changes. The framework unifies gauge field theory and constrained mechanics, offering insights into non-ideal constraints, geometric phases, and topological invariants. Our analysis demonstrates that the strong transversality condition captures geometric effects from constraint-curvature coupling that standard approaches cannot detect. This theoretical framework opens new avenues for analyzing complex physical systems, applying to fluid dynamics and Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We can view the Lipschitz constant as a height function on the space of maps between two manifolds and ask (as Gromov did nearly 30 years ago) what its ``Morse landscape'' looks like: are there high peaks, deep valleys and mountain passes? A simple and relatively well-studied version of this question: given two points in the same component (homotopic maps), does a path between them (a homotopy) have to pass through maps of much higher Lipschitz constant? Now we also consider similar questions for higher-dimensional cycles in the space. We make this precise using the language of persistent homology and give some first results.</description>

      <title>Horospherically Convex Optimization on Hadamard Manifolds Part I: Analysis and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesic convexity (g-convexity) is a natural generalization of convexity to Riemannian manifolds. However, g-convexity lacks many desirable properties satisfied by Euclidean convexity. For instance, the natural notions of half-spaces and affine functions are themselves not g-convex. Moreover, recent studies have shown that the oracle complexity of geodesically convex optimization necessarily depends on the curvature of the manifold (Criscitiello and Boumal, 2022; Criscitiello and Boumal, 2023; Hamilton and Moitra, 2021), a computational bottleneck for several problems, e.g., tensor scaling. Recently, Lewis et al. (2024) addressed this challenge by proving curvature-independent convergence of subgradient descent, assuming horospherical convexity of the objective's sublevel sets. Using a similar idea, we introduce a generalization of convex functions to Hadamard manifolds, utilizing horoballs and Busemann functions as building blocks (as proxies for half-spaces and affine functions). We refer to this new notion as horospherical convexity (h-convexity). We provide algorithms for both nonsmooth and smooth h-convex optimization, which have curvature-independent guarantees exactly matching those from Euclidean space; this includes generalizations of subgradient descent and Nesterov's accelerated method. Motivated by applications, we extend these algorithms and their convergence rates to minimizing a sum of horospherically convex functions, assuming access to a weighted-Fr\'echet-mean oracle.</description>

      <title>Existence of free boundary disks with constant mean curvature in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.16323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a surface $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ diffeomorphic to $S^2$, Struwe (Acta Math., 1988) proved that for almost every $H$ below the mean curvature of the smallest sphere enclosing $\Sigma$, there exists a branched immersed disk which has constant mean curvature $H$ and boundary meeting $\Sigma$ orthogonally. We reproduce this result using a different approach and improve it under additional convexity assumptions on $\Sigma$. Specifically, when $\Sigma$ itself is convex and has mean curvature bounded below by $H_0$, we obtain existence for all $H \in (0, H_0)$. Instead of the heat flow used by Struwe, we use a Sacks-Uhlenbeck type perturbation. As in previous joint work with Zhou (arXiv:2012.13379), a key ingredient for extending existence across the measure zero set of $H$'s is a Morse index upper bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022 Baraglia and Konno showed the following: for a smooth family of a homotopy $K3$ surface $X \to \mathbb{X} \stackrel{\pi}{\to} B$, if the tangent bundle along the fibers $T_B \mathbb{X}$ admits a spin structure, then $\mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ also admits a spin structure, where $\mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ is the vector bundle consisting of self-dual harmonic 2-forms. In this paper, we show that $T_B \mathbb{X} \oplus \pi^\ast \mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ admits a canonical spin structure. The proof is carried out by canonically constructing a lifting $O(1)$-gerbe for the spin structure on $\mathcal{H}^+(\mathbb{X})$ using the families Seiberg--Witten equations, starting from a lifting $O(1)$-gerbe for the spin structure on $T_B \mathbb{X}$.</description>

Abstract: The discretization of Cartan's exterior calculus of differential forms has been fruitful in a variety of theoretical and practical endeavors: from computational electromagnetics to the development of Finite-Element Exterior Calculus, the development of structure-preserving numerical tools satisfying exact discrete equivalents to Stokes' theorem or the de Rham complex for the exterior derivative have found numerous applications in computational physics. However, there has been a dearth of effort in establishing a more general discrete calculus, this time for differential forms with values in vector bundles over a combinatorial manifold equipped with a connection. In this work, we propose a discretization of the exterior covariant derivative of bundle-valued differential forms. We demonstrate that our discrete operator mimics its continuous counterpart, satisfies the Bianchi identities on simplicial cells, and contrary to previous attempts at its discretization, ensures numerical convergence to its exact evaluation with mesh refinement under mild assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We establish quantitative second-order Sobolev regularity for functions having a $2$-integrable $p$-Laplacian in bounded RCD spaces, with $p$ in a suitable range. In the finite-dimensional case, we also obtain Lipschitz regularity under the assumption that $p$-Laplacian is sufficiently integrable. Our results cover both $p$-Laplacian eigenfunctions and $p$-harmonic functions having relatively compact level sets.</description>
