      <title>The Taylor Measure and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel collection of signed measures, which will be apply called Taylor measures. Stochastic versions of the new measures are also defined and studied. We illustrate, through examples, how the deterministic and stochastic versions of the proposed Taylor measures emerge as a unifying framework that includes many concepts from mathematics and probability theory as special cases.</description>

      <title>The Limiting Spectral Distribution for Sparse Elliptic Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies sparse elliptic random matrix models which generalize both the classical elliptic ensembles and sparse i.i.d. matrix models by incorporating correlated entries and a tunable sparsity parameter $p_n$. Each $n\times n$ matrix $X_n$ is formed by entry-wise multiplication of an elliptic random matrix by an elliptic matrix of Bernoulli($p_n$) variables, where $np_n\to\infty$, allowing for interpolation between dense and sparse regimes. The main result establishes that under appropriate normalization, the empirical spectral measures of these matrices converge weakly in probability to the uniform measure on a rotated ellipsoid in the complex plane as the dimension $n$ tends to infinity. Interestingly, the shape of the limiting ellipsoid depends not just on the mirrored entry-wise correlation structure, but also non-trivially on the sparsity limit $p=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}p_n\in[0,1]$. The main result generalizes and recovers many classical results in sparse and dense regimes for elliptic and i.i.d. random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Perfect t-embeddings of doubly periodic Aztec diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-scale geometry of t-surfaces -- pairs of perfect t-embeddings and their associated origami maps -- arising from dimer models on Aztec diamonds with periodic edge weights. We prove that these t-surfaces converge to space-like maximal surfaces in the Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$. We observe that the frozen and gas regions influence the geometry of the limiting surface in striking ways: all frozen regions collapse to four boundary points, regardless of the number of frozen regions, while each gas region collapses to a distinct light-like cusp in the interior of the surface. In the absence of gas regions, the limiting surface lies entirely within $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$; in the general case, however, this is no longer true.
  The limiting surface is sensitive to the detailed structure of the model: both the positions of the cusps, and the placement of the boundary vertices, depend on the precise way the edge weights are distributed on the Aztec diamond. Nevertheless, we show that the global conformal structure remains robust and coincides with the Kenyon-Okounkov conformal structure. We further conjecture that the cusp locations encode the shift in the discrete Gaussian component that appears in the global fluctuations of the dimer model.</description>

      <title>Conditional exponential directed last passage percolation under a one-point upper large deviation event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under typical scaling, the last passage time field of the directed last passage percolation model with exponential site distributions converges to the KPZ fixed point. In this paper, we consider an atypical scenario in which the last passage time to a specific site is unusually large, and we explore how the last passage time field changes under this one-point upper large deviation event. We prove a conditional law of large numbers and compute the limiting fluctuations in certain regimes. Our proofs rely on an analysis of explicit multi-point distributions.</description>

      <title>Switching Diffusion Systems with Past-Dependent Switching and Countable State Space: Successful Couplings and Strong Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies a class of switching diffusion systems where the switching component takes values in a countable state space and its transition rates depend on the history of the continuous component. Under suitable conditions, we construct a successful coupling that establishes stability of the underlying process in the total variation norm. The coupling approach also enables us to derive strong ergodicity for the underlying process. Finally, we illustrate the main results with an $N$-body mean-field model featuring past-dependent switching and a countable state space.</description>

      <title>Dependent Default Modeling through Multivariate Generalized Cox Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multivariate framework for modeling dependent default times that extends the classical Cox process by incorporating both common and idiosyncratic shocks. Our construction uses c\`adl\`ag, increasing processes to model cumulative intensities, relaxing the requirement of absolutely continuous compensators. Analytical tractability is preserved through the multiplicative decomposition of Az\'ema supermartingales under assumptions that guarantee deterministic compensators. The framework captures a wide range of dependence structures and allows for both simultaneous and non-simultaneous defaults. We derive closed-form expressions for joint survival probabilities and illustrate the flexibility of the model through examples based on L\'evy subordinators, compound Poisson processes, and shot-noise processes, encompassing several well-known models from the literature as special cases. Finally, we show how the framework can be extended to incorporate stochastic continuous components, thereby unifying gradual and abrupt sources of default risk.</description>

      <title>On the spatio-temporal increments of nonlinear parabolic SPDEs and the open KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spatio-temporal increments of the solutions to nonlinear parabolic SPDEs on a bounded interval with Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin boundary conditions. We identify the exact local and uniform spatio-temporal moduli of continuity for the sample functions of the solutions. These moduli of continuity results imply the existence of random points in space-time at which spatio-temporal oscillations are exceptionally large. We also establish small-ball probability estimates and Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm for spatio-temporal increments. Our method yields extension of some of these results to the open KPZ equation on the unit interval with inhomogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Our key ingredients include new strong local non-determinism results for linear stochastic heat equation under various types of boundary conditions, and detailed estimates for the errors in linearization of spatio-temporal increments of the solution to the nonlinear equation.</description>

      <title>On local large deviations for decoupled random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decoupled standard random walk is a sequence of independent random variables $(\hat{S}_n)_{n \geq 1}$ such that, for each $n \geq 1$, the distribution of $\hat{S}_n$ is the same as that of $S_n = \xi_1 + \ldots + \xi_n$, where $(\xi_k)_{k \geq 1}$ are independent copies of a nonnegative random variable $\xi$. We consider the counting process $(\hat{N}(t))_{t\geq 0}$ defined as the number of terms $\hat{S}_n$ in the sequence $(\hat{S}_n)_{n \geq 1}$ that lie within the interval $[0, t]$. Under various assumptions on the tail distribution of $\xi$, we derive logarithmic asymptotics for the local large deviation probabilities $\mathbb{P}\{\hat{N}(t) = \lfloor b \, \mathbb{E}[\hat{N}(t)] \rfloor\}$ as $t \to \infty$ for a fixed constant $b &gt; 0$. These results are then applied to obtain a logarithmic local large deviations asymptotic for the counting process associated with the infinite Ginibre ensemble and, more generally, for determinantal point processes with the Mittag-Leffler kernel.</description>

      <title>A resolution of the Gaussian hyperplane tessellation conjecture on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how many hyperplanes with independent standard Gaussian directions one needs to produce a $\delta$-uniform tessellation of a subset $S$ of the Euclidean sphere, meaning that for any pair of points in $S$ the fraction of hyperplanes separating them corresponds to their geodesic distance up to an additive error $\delta$. It was conjectured that $\delta^{-2}w_*(S)^2$ Gaussian random hyperplanes are necessary and sufficient for this purpose, where $w_*(S)$ is the Gaussian complexity of $S$. We falsify this conjecture by constructing a set $S$ where $\delta^{-3}w_*(S)^2$ Gaussian hyperplanes are necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <title>The discrete periodic Pitman transform: invariances, braid relations, and Burke properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the discrete periodic Pitman transform, first introduced by Corwin, Gu, and the fifth author. We prove that, for polymers in a periodic environment, single-path and multi-path partition functions are preserved under the action of this transform on the weights in the polymer model. As a corollary, we prove that the discrete periodic Pitman transform satisfies the same braid relations that are satisfied for the full-line Pitman transform, shown by Biane, Bougerol, and O'Connell. Combined with a new inhomogeneous Burke property for the periodic Pitman transform, we prove a multi-path invariance result for the periodic inverse-gamma polymer under permutations of the column parameters. In the limit to the full-line case, we obtain a multi-path extension of a recent invariance result of Bates, Emrah, Martin, Sepp\"al\"ainen, and the fifth author, in both positive and zero-temperature. Additionally, we give a combinatorial description of the distribution of the $2$-component jointly invariant measures for a discrete-time Markov chain.</description>

      <title>On the Foundations of Dynamic Games and Probability: Decision Making in Stochastic Extensive Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an abstract and general language for the fundamental objects underlying dynamic games under probabilistic uncertainty is developed. Combining the theory of decision trees by Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2005) and a Harsanyian notion of exogenous uncertainty, the concept of stochastic decision forests is introduced. Exogenous information is modelled via filtration-like objects providing dynamic updates on the "realised tree", and an abstract decision-theoretic model of adapted choice is formulated.
  Based on this, a consistent model of "rules" is introduced, leading to the notion of stochastic extensive forms, generalising Al\'os-Ferrer--Ritzberger (2008, 2011). Well-posedness is completely characterised in terms of order-theoretic properties of the underlying forest. Moreover, the language of stochastic extensive forms addresses a vast class of dynamic decision problems formulated in terms of time-indexed paths of action -- a first step towards an approximation theory of continuous-time games based on stochastic processes. In this formulation, a well-posed theory obtains if and only if the time half-axis is essentially well-ordered.
  Therefore, a relaxed game-theoretic model of "extensive form characteristics" is introduced: the stochastic process form. Its action processes arise from well-posed action path stochastic extensive forms under tilting convergence, which is introduced in order to faithfully describe accumulating reaction behaviour. The problem of instantaneous reaction and information about it is tackled by introducing vertically extended continuous time, for which a suitable stochastic analysis is developed. Stochastic process forms admit a natural notion of information sets, subgames, and equilibrium. The theory applies to stochastic differential and timing games, e.g., addressing issues in Fudenberg--Tirole (1985) and Riedel--Steg (2017) .</description>

      <title>General asymptotic representations of indexes based on the functional empirical process and the residual functional empirical process and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to establish a general asymptotic representation (\textit{GAR}) for a wide range of statistics, employing two fundamental processes: the functional empirical process (\textit{fep}) and the residual functional empirical process introduced by Lo and Sall (2010a, 2010b), denoted as \textit{lrfep}. The functional empirical process (\textit{fep}) is defined as follows:
  $$ \mathbb{G}_n(h)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \{h(X_j)-\mathbb{E}h(X_j)\}, $$
  \Bin [where $X$, $X_1$, $\cdots$, $X_n$ is a sample from a random $d$-vectors $X$ of size $(n+1)$ with $n\geq 1$ and $h$ is a measurable function defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\mathbb{E}h(X)^2&lt;+\infty$]. It is a powerful tool for deriving asymptotic laws. An earlier and simpler version of this paper focused on the application of the (\textit{fep}) to statistics $J_n$ that can be turned into an asymptotic algebraic expression of empirical functions of the form
  $$ J_n=\mathbb{E}h(X) + n^{-1/2} \mathbb{G}_n(h) + o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/2}). \ \ \ \textit{SGAR} $$
  \Bin However, not all statistics, in particular welfare indexes, conform to this form. In many scenarios, functions of the order statistics $X_{1,n}\leq$, $\cdots$, $\leq X_{n,n}$ are involved, resulting in $L$-statistics. In such cases, the (\textit{fep}) can still be utilized, but in combination with the related residual functional empirical process introduced by Lo and Sall (2010a, 2010b). This combination leads to general asymptotic representations (GAR) for a wide range of statistical indexes
  $$ J_n=\mathbb{E}h(X) + n^{-1/2} \biggr(\mathbb{G}_n(h) + \int_{0}^{1} \mathbb{G}_n(\tilde{f}_s) \ell(s) \ ds + o_{\mathbb{P}}(1)\biggr), \ \ \textit{FGAR} $$</description>

      <title>Kaminsky Type Functional Equations and Bivariate Residual Lifetimes Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers generalizations of the functional equations that characterize the lack-of-memory properties at univariate and bivariate levels. Specifically, we extend the univariate functional equation introduced by Kaminsky (1983) (that characterizes the Gompertz distribution) and the corresponding bivariate strong and weak versions later studied in Marshall and Olkin (2015) by allowing the conditional survival distribution to be a fully general time dependent distortion of the unconditional one: in particular, we show that the solutions of these generalized functional equations coincide with the solutions of the functional equations studied in Ricci (2024). Since the univariate functional equation leads only to a trivial case and the solutions of the strong bivariate functional equation have been already studied in the literature, the analysis is focused on the weak bivariate case, where joint residual lifetimes are conditioned on survival beyond a common threshold t. In view of potential applications to insurance risk analysis, the impact of the time dependent distortion on the aging properties of the associated distribution is analized as well as the time dependent dependence structure of the residual lifetimes through time-varying versions of the Kendall's function and of the tail dependence coefficients. Many examples are provided and a wide family of bivariate survival distributions satisfying the generalized weak functional equation is constructed through a mixing approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate physical aspects of path signatures by formulating randomised path developments within the framework of matrix models in quantum field theory. Using tools from physics, we introduce a new family of randomised path developments and derive corresponding loop equations. We then interpret unitary randomised path developments as time evolution operators on a Hilbert space of qubits. This leads to a definition of a quantum path signature feature map and associated quantum signature kernel through a quantum circuit construction. In the case of the Gaussian matrix model, we study a random ensemble of Pauli strings and formulate a quantum algorithm to compute such kernel.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Deterministic Sampling for Constrained Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel class of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMP) that are designed to sample from constrained probability distributions $\pi$ supported on a convex set $\mathcal{M}$. This class of PDMPs adapts the concept of a mirror map from convex optimisation to address sampling problems. Such samplers provides unbiased algorithms that respect the constraints and, moreover, allow for exact subsampling. We demonstrate the advantages of these algorithms on a range of constrained sampling problems where the proposed algorithm outperforms state of the art stochastic differential equation-based methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The developments over the last five decades concerning numerical discretisations of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations have lead to reliable tools for their approximation: those include stable methods to properly address the incompressibility constraint, stable discretisations to account for convection dominated problems, efficient time (splitting) methods, and methods to tackle their nonlinear character. While these tools may successfully be applied to reliably simulate even more complex fluid flow PDE models, their understanding requires a fundamental revision in the case of stochastic fluid models, which are gaining increased importance nowadays.
  This work motivates and surveys optimally convergent numerical methods for the stochastic Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations that were obtained in the last decades. Furtheremore, we computationally illustrate the failure of some of those methods from the deterministic setting, if they are straight-forwardly applied to the stochastic case. In fact, we explain why some of these deterministic methods perform sub-optimally by highlighting crucial analytical differences between the deterministic and stochastic equations -- and how modifications of the deterministic methods restore their optimal performance if they properly address the probabilistic nature of the stochastic problem.
  Next to the numerical analysis of schemes, we propose a general benchmark of prototypic fluid flow problems driven by different types of noise to also compare new algorithms by simulations in terms of complexities, efficiencies, and possible limitations. The driving motivation is to reach a better comparison of simulations for new schemes in terms of accuracy and complexities, and to also complement theoretical performance studies for restricted settings of data by more realistic ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the decay of correlations in time for (1+1)-dimensional polymer models in the KPZ universality class has been a challenging topic. Following numerical studies by physicists, concrete conjectures were formulated by Ferrari and Spohn (Ferrari-Spohn '16) in the context of planar exponential last passage percolation. These have mostly been resolved by various authors. In the context of positive temperature lattice models, however, these questions have remained open. We consider the time correlation problem for the exactly solvable inverse-gamma polymer in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We establish, up to constant factors, upper and lower bounds on the correlation between free energy functions for two polymers rooted at the origin (droplet initial condition) when the endpoints are either close together or far apart. We find the same exponents as predicted in (Ferrari-Spohn '16). Our arguments rely on the understanding of stationary polymers, coupling, and random walk comparison. We use recently established moderate deviation estimates for the free energy. In particular, we do not require asymptotic analysis of complicated exact formulae.</description>

      <title>SDE driven by cylindrical $\alpha$-stable process with distributional drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\alpha \in (1,2)$, we study the following stochastic differential equation driven by a non-degenerate symmetric $\alpha$-stable process in $\mathbb{R}^d$:
  \begin{align*} {\rm d} X_t=b(t,X_t){\mathord{{\rm d}}} t+\sigma(t,X_{t-}){\mathord{{\rm d}}} L_t^{(\alpha)},\ \ X_0 =x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \end{align*} where $b$ belongs to $ L^\infty(\mathbb{R}_+;\mathbf{C}^{-\beta}(\mathbb{R}^d))$ with some $\beta\in(0,\alpha-1)$, and $\mathbf{C}^\beta$ denotes a Besov space (see Definition (2.2) below). The coefficient $\sigma:\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d \otimes \mathbb{R}^d$ is a measurable matrix-valued function. The noise $L_t^{(\alpha)}=(L_t^{(\alpha),1},...,L_t^{(\alpha),d})$ consists of independent $1$-dimensional symmetric $\alpha$-stable processes, and is referred to as a cylindrical $\alpha$-stable process. We establish the well-posedness of weak solutions to the SDE, and provide quantitative stability estimates with respect to the drift coefficients.</description>

      <title>Sharp concentration for sums of matrices with Markovian dependence through universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a sum of random matrices generated by a $\psi$-mixing Markov chain has similar spectral properties to a Gaussian matrix with the same mean and covariance structure. This nonasymptotic universality principle enables sharp concentration inequalities when combined with recent advances in the Gaussian literature. We illustrate the theory with examples, showing how it enables polynomial dimensional improvements relative to previous Markovian matrix concentration results when applied to Wigner-type matrices, and how one can recover sharp limiting values for a model used to study of spectral clustering techniques.
  A key challenge in the proof is that techniques based only on classical cumulants, which can be used when summands are independent, are not sufficient on their own for efficient estimates in a Markovian setting. Our approach exploits Boolean cumulants and a change--of--measure argument.</description>

      <title>Gelation in cluster coagulation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of gelation in the cluster coagulation model introduced by Norris [\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}, 209(2):407-435 (2000)], where pairs of clusters of types $(x,y)$ taking values in a measure space $E$, merge to form a new particle of type $z\in E$ according to a transition kernel $K(x,y, \mathrm{d} z)$. This model possesses enough generality to accommodate inhomogeneities in the evolution of clusters, including variations in their shape or spatial distribution. We derive general, sufficient criteria for stochastic gelation in this model. As particular cases, we extend results related to the classical Marcus--Lushnikov coagulation process, showing that reasonable `homogenous' coagulation processes with exponent $\gamma&gt;1$ yield gelation; and also, coagulation processes with kernel $\bar{K}(m,n)~\geq~(m \wedge n) \log{(m \wedge n)}^{3 +\epsilon}$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the multi-point probability distribution of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a half-space, starting from a general deterministic initial condition. More precisely, let $h(t,x)$ denote the height function of TASEP at position $x$ and time $t$; we provide an explicit formula for \begin{equation*} \mathbb{P}(h(t,y_1)\leq s_1, \ldots, h(t,y_m)\leq s_m). \end{equation*} The formula presented is well-suited for the scaling limit analysis. By applying a 1:2:3 scaling, we derive the probability distribution for the half-space KPZ fixed point, which is conjectured to be the universal process for the limit of the KPZ universality models restricted to a half-space.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius concentration for inhomogeneous random matrices with independent entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a square random matrix of size $n$, with mean zero, independent but not identically distributed entries, with variance profile $S$. When entries are i.i.d. with unit variance, the spectral radius of $n^{-1/2}A$ converges to $1$ whereas the operator norm converges to 2. Motivated by recent interest in inhomogeneous random matrices, in particular non-Hermitian random band matrices, we formulate general upper bounds for $\rho(A)$, the spectral radius of $A$, in terms of the variance $S$. We prove (1) after suitable normalization $\rho(A)$ is bounded by $1+\epsilon$ up to the optimal sparsity $\sigma_*\gg (\log n)^{-1/2}$ where $\sigma_*$ is the largest standard deviation of an individual entry; (2) a small deviation inequality for $\rho(A)$ capturing fluctuation beyond the optimal scale $\sigma_*^{-1}$; (3) a large deviation inequality for $\rho(A)$ with Gaussian entries and doubly stochastic variance; and (4) boundedness of $\rho(A)$ in certain heavy-tailed regimes with only $2+\epsilon$ finite moments and inhomogeneous variance profile $S$. The proof relies heavily on the trace moment method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide probabilistic and computational results on Markovian multivariate Hawkes processes and induced population processes. By applying the Markov property, we characterize in closed form a joint transform, bijective to the probability distribution, of the population process and its underlying intensity process. We demonstrate a method that exploits the transform to obtain analytic expressions for transient and stationary multivariate moments of any order, as well as auto- and cross-covariances. We reveal a nested sequence of block matrices that yields the moments in explicit form and brings important computational advantages. We also establish the asymptotic behavior of the intensity of the multivariate Hawkes process in its nearly unstable regime, under a specific parameterization. In extensive numerical experiments, we analyze the computational complexity, accuracy and efficiency of the established results.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega_1, \ldots, \Omega_m$ be probability spaces, let $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \cdots \times \Omega_m$ be their product and let $A_1, \ldots, A_n \subset \Omega$ be events. Suppose that each event $A_i$ depends on $r_i$ coordinates of a point $x \in \Omega$, $x=\left(\xi_1, \ldots, \xi_m\right)$, and that for each event $A_i$ there are $\Delta_i$ of other events $A_j$ that depend on some of the coordinates that $A_i$ depends on. Let $\Delta=\max\{5,\ \Delta_i: i=1, \ldots, n\}$ and let $\mu_i=\min\{r_i,\ \Delta_i+1\}$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. We prove that if $P(A_i) &lt; (3\Delta)^{-3\mu_i}$ for all $i$, then for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$, the probability $P\left( \bigcap_{i=1}^n \overline{A}_i\right)$ of the intersection of the complements of all $A_i$ can be computed within relative error $\epsilon$ in polynomial time from the probabilities $P\left(A_{i_1} \cap \ldots \cap A_{i_k}\right)$ of $k$-wise intersections of the events $A_i$ for $k = e^{O(\Delta)} \ln (n/\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>On the surjectivity of the conditional expectation given a real random variable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distributions of random couples $(X,Y)$ with $X$ real-valued such that any non-negative integrable random variable $f(X)$ can be represented as a conditional expectation, $f(X)=\mathbb{E}[g(Y)|X]$, for some non-negative measurable function $g$. It turns out that this representation property is related to the smallness of the support of the conditional law of $X$ given $Y$, and in particular fails when this conditional law almost surely has a non-zero absolutely continuous component with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We give a sufficient condition for the representation property and check that it is also necessary under some additional assumptions (for instance when $X$ or $Y$ are discrete). We also exhibit a rather involved example where the representation property holds but the sufficient condition does not. Finally, we discuss a weakened representation property where the non-negativity of $g$ is relaxed. This study is motivated by the calibration of time-discretized path-dependent volatility models to the implied volatility surface.</description>

      <title>Universality for fluctuations of counting statistics of random normal matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fluctuations of the number of eigenvalues of $n\times n$ random normal matrices depending on a potential $Q$ in a given set $A$. These eigenvalues are known to form a determinantal point process, and are known to accumulate on a compact set called the droplet under mild conditions on $Q$. When $A$ is a Borel set strictly inside the droplet, we show that the variance of the number of eigenvalues $N_A^{(n)}$ in $A$ has a limiting behavior given by
  \begin{align*} \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\sqrt n}\operatorname{Var } N_A^{(n)} = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt\pi}\int_{\partial_* A} \sqrt{\Delta Q(z)} \, d\mathcal H^1(z), \end{align*} where $\partial_* A$ is the measure theoretic boundary of $A$, $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ denotes the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and $\Delta = \partial_z \overline{\partial_z}$. We also consider the case where $A$ is a microscopic dilation of the droplet and fully generalize a result by Akemann, Byun and Ebke for arbitrary potentials. In this result $d\mathcal H^1(z)$ is replaced by the harmonic measure at $\infty$ associated with the exterior of the droplet. This second result is proved by strengthening results due to Hedenmalm-Wennman and Ameur-Cronvall on the asymptotic behavior of the associated correlation kernel near the droplet boundary.</description>

      <title>Operator dependent para-controlled calculus, periodic homogenisation and singular PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variant of the para-controlled distributions framework based on operator dependent (generalised) Besov spaces. These spaces were introduced by Kerkyacharian-Petrushev ([KP15]). In contrast to the Fourier decomposition in the classical setting, they are built from spectral decomposition of general self-adjoint elliptic operators. A major difference is that products of two spectrally localised functions in general have ``frequencies" spread over the whole spectrum. We obtain a decay estimate on ``high frequency" component of the product of two spectrally-localised functions. This enables us to obtain uniform bounds for the naturally associated para-product and commutator operations over a class of operators. This in particular includes the family of periodic homogenisation operators uniform in the oscillation parameter.
  Next, we show convergence properties of these operations in the periodic homogenisation setting. A key ingredient is the convergence of the generalised Littlewood-Paley block operators with quantitative dependence on the spectrum level. The proof combines a novel clustering argument to group nearby eigenvalues, Weyl's asymptotic formula that implies quantitative bounds on the sizes and locations of the eigenvalue clusters, together with a result by Kenig-Lin-Shen ([KLS13]) on convergence of individual eigenvalues.
  Finally, we apply this framework to periodic homogenisation problems for dynamical $\Phi^4_3$ and KPZ equations. Assuming the convergence of stochastic objects to their homogenised limit, we show that the solutions and fluxes also converge to the corresponding limits. The convergence of the explicit stochastic terms with suitable renormalisations will be treated in a separate note.</description>

      <title>Shift-Dispersion Decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\'er Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divergence functions are measures of distance or dissimilarity between probability distributions that serve various purposes in statistics and applications. We propose decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\'er distances$-$which compare two distributions by integrating over their differences in distribution or quantile functions$-$into directed shift and dispersion components. These components are obtained by dividing the differences between the quantile functions into contributions arising from shift and dispersion, respectively. Our decompositions add information on how the distributions differ in a condensed form and consequently enhance the interpretability of the underlying divergences. We show that our decompositions satisfy a number of natural properties and are unique in doing so in location-scale families. The decompositions allow to derive sensitivities of the divergence measures to changes in location and dispersion, and they give rise to weak stochastic order relations that are linked to the usual stochastic and the dispersive order. Our theoretical developments are illustrated in two applications, where we focus on forecast evaluation of temperature extremes and on the design of probabilistic surveys in economics.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>A notion of partial order in the Choose the Leader model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we continue the study of non-chaotic asymptotic correlations in many element systems and discuss the emergence of a new notion of asymptotic correlation -- partial order -- in the Choose the Leader (CL) system. Similarly to the newly defined notion of order, partial order refers to alignment of the elements in the system -- though it allows for deviation from total adherence. Our presented work revolves around the definition of partial order and shows its emergence in the CL model in its original critical scaling. Furthermore, we discuss the propagation of partial order in the CL model and give a quantitative estimate to the convergence to this state. This new notion (as well as that of order) opens the door to exploring old and new (probabilistic) models of biological and societal nature in a more realistic way.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices, Riemannian geometry, and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each $n \geq 1$ and sign pattern $\epsilon \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$, we introduce a cone of real symmetric matrices $LPM_n(\epsilon)$: those with leading principal $k \times k$ minors of signs $\epsilon_k$. These cones are pairwise disjoint and their union $LPM_n$ is an open dense cone in all symmetric matrices; they subsume positive and negative definite matrices, and symmetric (P-,) N-, PN-, almost P-, and almost N- matrices. We show that each $LPM_n$ matrix $A$ admits an uncountable family of Cholesky-type factorizations - yielding a unique lower triangular matrix $L$ with positive diagonals - with additional attractive properties: (i) each such factorization is algorithmic; and (ii) each such Cholesky map $A \mapsto L$ is a smooth diffeomorphism from $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ onto an open Euclidean ball.
  We then show that (iii) the (diffeomorphic) balls $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ are isometric Riemannian manifolds as well as isomorphic abelian Lie groups, each equipped with a translation-invariant Riemannian metric (and hence Riemannian means/barycentres). Moreover, (iv) this abelian metric group structure on each $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ - and hence the log-Cholesky metric on Cholesky space - yields an isometric isomorphism onto a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex version of this also holds.
  In the latter part, we show that the abelian group $PD_n$ of positive definite matrices, with its bi-invariant log-Cholesky metric, is precisely the identity-component of a larger group with an alternate metric: the open dense cone $LPM_n$. This also holds for Hermitian matrices over several subfields $\mathbb{F} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. As a result, (v) the groups $LPM_n^{\mathbb{F}}$ and $LPM_\infty^{\mathbb{F}}$ admit a rich probability theory, and the cones $LPM_n(\epsilon), TPM_n(\epsilon)$ admit Wishart densities with signed Bartlett decompositions.</description>
