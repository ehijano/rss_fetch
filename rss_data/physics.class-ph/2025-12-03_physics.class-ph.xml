      <title>Numerical analysis of the impact of water temperature setpoint and energy strategies on indoor pool performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor swimming pools (ISPs) consume significant amounts of electrical and thermal energy to ensure the heating of water and air, ventilation, and maintaining adequate humidity levels. This is measured in GWh per year for large installations, such as Olympic swimming pools (SPs). In this paper, the problem is initially addressed using a phenomenological approach at steady state of the air-water coupling, based on a real case study. The aim is to identify the key phenomena and the constraints that are the most sensitive, including those related to water and air quality management. A key action lever is found in evaporation, and more specifically, water temperature and the indoor dewpoint temperature, which act as its precursors. In a second step, two different strategies were tested to reduce energy consumption for water heating. It was determined that a strategy which incorporates night setback in conjunction with a precise restart time yields a maximum gain of 4%. The second strategy aims to enhance the energy recovery of thermal solar panels by enabling slight overheating of the pool. Its large volume provides effective energy storage, with estimated energy savings of up to 17% for a 1___ C overheating. This strategy appears to be a viable option, as it is straightforward to implement. However, the impact of water overheating on the energy consumption of AHU still needs to be analyzed and managed.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Prediction of Sintering Deformation in 3D-Printed Porcelain Filament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sintering of printed porcelain filaments can be strongly affected by overhang geometry, thin features, and printing-induced anisotropy. These effects are particularly difficult to simulate because they require accurately capturing the interplay between sintering kinetics, viscous deformation, and macroscopic anisotropy. In this study, a robust and predictive model is established experimentally using anisotropic sintering dilatometry combined with overhang-deformation calibration through finite element simulations (FEM).  The sintering behavior is identified using a porosity-temperature-independent minimization strategy applied to multi-rate dilatometry. Pellet anisotropy is incorporated via FEM by imposing directional sintering stresses. The deformation behavior is then calibrated by adjusting the shear viscosity to match overhang shapes deformation. The resulting model is finally validated on overhanging bar geometries. This step-by-step approach provides a comprehensive assessment of porcelain sintering while accurately capturing deformation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Conservation of Momentum and Energy in the Lorenz-Abraham-Dirac Equation of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a brief review of the modified causal Lorentz-Abraham classical equation of motion for an extended charged sphere and its limit to the mass-renormalized modified causal Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation of motion as the radius of the charged sphere approaches zero, a streamlined derivation is given for the conditions on the external force required for these modified equations of motion to satisfy conservation of momentum and energy.</description>
