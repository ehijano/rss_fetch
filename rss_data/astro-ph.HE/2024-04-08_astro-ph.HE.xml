      <title>On the transition stage of pulsar pulsed radio emission and its potential association with radio pulsar nulling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the precise mechanism of generating pulsed coherent radio emission from pulsars remains elusive, certain gap-invoking models (especially, the inner gap model) offer a comprehensive and plausible explanation for the genesis and termination of such emissions. However, the transition stage between the period of persistent radio emission and the period of radio quiet remains poorly understood, despite observations indicating that a radio pulsar in the pulse nulling state is undergoing the transition stage. In this study, we present a qualitative explanation for the elusive transition stage by modeling pulsar magnetospheres analytically as equivalent RC circuits based on the inner gap model. Our result indicates that, due to lengthy spin-down, older radio pulsars will gradually shift from the state of persistent radio emission to a certain type of pulse nulling state by delayed sparks within their inner gaps.</description>

      <title>Central Engine and Spectral Energy Distribution Properties of High Redshift Gamma Ray Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the properties of central engines in the $\gamma$-ray blazars located at high redshifts beyond z~&gt;~0.4, where the extra-galactic background light (EBL) starts affecting their $\gamma$-ray spectra. The physical engine that provides power to the blazars of very high bolometric luminosity is assumed to be a highly collimated jet of matter moving relativistically away from the supermassive black hole (SMBH), located in the central region of the host galaxy, in a direction aligned toward the Earth. Due to their peculiar geometry and special physical conditions, blazars at redshifts beyond z~&gt;~0.4 are bright enough to be detected in the $\gamma$-ray energy band. In this work, we investigate the physical properties of high-$z$ $\gamma$-ray blazars detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the \emph{Fermi} satellite. We also study the properties of their emission regions and the central engines and discuss cosmological and astrophysical implications.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Accretion-Driven Starquakes in Recycled Millisecond Pulsars using Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recycled millisecond pulsars are susceptible to starquakes as they are continuously accreting matter from their binary companion. A starquake happens when the rotational frequency of the star crosses its breaking frequency. In this study, we perform a model analysis of an accreting neutron star suffering a starquake. We analyze two models: a spherical star with accreting mountains and a deformed star with accreting mountains. We find that as the star crosses the breaking frequency and suffers a starquake there is a sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal arriving from them. It is interesting to note that the amplitude of the gravitational wave signals increases suddenly for the spherical star. In contrast, for the deformed star, the amplitude of the continuous gravitational wave signal decreases suddenly. This sudden change in the continuous gravitational wave signal in recycled millisecond pulsars can be a unique signature for such pulsars undergoing a starquake.</description>

      <title>Relativistic jet ejections from slim disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ejection mechanism of relativistic jets from slim disks is studied. Since the radiation pressure is dominant in the slim disk, radiative energy flow arises along the pressure gradient in the vertical direction. The divergence of the radiative flux tells us that the radiative energy flow from a bottom layer near the equatorial plane is absorbed by another layer upper than the boundary surface. The absorbed energy accumulates in the upper layer as the matter advances inward and calculations show that the specific energy of the flow in the upper layer can be as large as $\sim c^{2}$ near the black hole when the accretion rate through the upper layer is relatively low. Since the specific energy $\sim c^{2}$ is much larger than the gravitational energy, the height of the upper layer could significantly increase then. Hence, the innermost part of the upper layer after almost all the angular momentum has been removed could have a much larger height than the black hole size and collide with one another around the central axis of the disk, bouncing back from the axis as simultaneously expanding along the axis. The flow is expected to go outward along the central axis and to become supersonic due to the cross-section-change of the flow, getting the relativistic jets finally.</description>

      <title>Nuclear uncertainties associated with the ejecta of a neutron-star black-hole accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e. temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a neutron star-black hole accretion disk and the find spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration and Nonthermal Emission at the Intrabinary Shock of Spider Pulsars. I: Non-Radiative Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider pulsars are compact binary systems composed of a millisecond pulsar and a low-mass companion. Their X-ray emission - modulated on the orbital period - is interpreted as synchrotron radiation from high-energy electrons accelerated at the intrabinary shock. We perform global two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of the intrabinary shock, assuming that the shock wraps around the companion star. When the pulsar spin axis is nearly aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we find that the magnetic energy of the relativistic pulsar wind - composed of magnetic stripes of alternating field polarity - efficiently converts to particle energy at the intrabinary shock, via shock-driven reconnection. The highest energy particles accelerated by reconnection can stream ahead of the shock and be further accelerated by the upstream motional electric field. In the downstream, further energization is governed by stochastic interactions with the plasmoids / magnetic islands generated by reconnection. We also extend our earlier work (Cort\'es &amp; Sironi 2022) by performing simulations that have a larger (and more realistic) companion size and a more strongly magnetized pulsar wind. We confirm that our first-principles synchrotron spectra and lightcurves are in good agreement with X-ray observations.</description>

      <title>The black hole low mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple, and formed without a kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence suggests that when compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars form, they may receive a ``natal kick,'' where the stellar remnant gains momentum. Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial, yet limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks. Here, we report the discovery that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3500 astronomical units away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole likely received a sub-5 kilometer per second kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery reveals that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of low-mass X-ray binaries involving a hierarchical triple structure. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3-5 billion years ago, and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is likely that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field oscillation model of pulsar radio emission: prediction of an observable effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of pulsars, the rotating-lighthouse model has been the choice of model to explain the radiation pulsation of pulsars. After discovering that some main sequence stars (e.g., CU Virginis) and ultracool dwarfs (e.g., TVLM 513-46546) also behave like pulsars, the lighthouse model was again adopted to explain their pulse signals. Our research found that if we use the magnetic-field oscillation (MO) model, we can explain the pulse radiation results better regardless of whether its source is a neutron star, a main-sequence star or an ultracool dwarf. We propose a verifiable prediction that can be used to evaluate the MO model. Our prediction is that there is a 90 degree phase lag between the magnetic field and radio signal of TVLM 513-46546, and the zero-crossing point of the magnetic field is the moment when the direction of the light's circular polarization is reversed. No new observations are needed to check this prediction, but certain existing data needs to be re-mined.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Origin of Ultra-long Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it discovered two ultra-long period radio transients GLEAM-X J162759.5-523504.3 (J1627) and GPM J1839$-$10 (J1839) with spin periods longer than 1000 s. The origin of these two ultra-long period radio transients is intriguing in understanding the spin evolution of neutron stars (NSs). In this work, we diagnose whether the interaction between strong magnetized NSs and fallback disks can spin NSs down to the observed ultra-long period. Our simulations found that the magnetar+fallback disk model can account for the observed period, period derivative, and X-ray luminosity of J1627 in the quasi-spin-equilibrium stage. To evolve to the current state of J1627, the initial mass-accretion rate of the fallback disk and the magnetic field of the NS are in the range of $(1.1-30)\times10^{24}~\rm g\,s^{-1}$ and $(2-5)\times10^{14}~\rm G$, respectively. In an active lifetime of fallback disk, J1839 is impossible to achieve the observed upper limit of period derivative. Therefore, we propose that J1839 may be in the second ejector phase after the fallback disk becomes inactive. Those NSs with a magnetic field of $(2-6)\times10^{14}~\rm G$ and a fallback disk with an initial mass-accretion rate of $\sim10^{24}-10^{26}~\rm g\,s^{-1}$ are the possible progenitors of J1839.</description>

      <title>Bell Instability-Mediated Diffusive Shock Acceleration at Supernova Blast Wave Shock Propagating in the ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova blast wave shock is a very important site of cosmic-ray acceleration. However, the detailed physical process of acceleration, in particular, non-linear interplay between cosmic-ray streaming and magnetic field amplification has not been studied under a realistic environment. In this paper, using a unique and novel numerical method, we study cosmic-ray acceleration at supernova blast wave shock propagating in the interstellar medium with well-resolved magnetic field amplification by non-resonant hybrid instability (or Bell instability). We find that the magnetic field is mildly amplified under typical ISM conditions that leads to maximum cosmic-ray energy ~30 TeV for supernova remnants with age ~1000 years consistent with gamma-ray observations. The strength of the amplified magnetic field does not reach so-called saturation level, because cosmic-ray electric current towards the shock upstream has finite spatial extent, by which Bell instability cannot experience many e-folding times.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Massive Distant Clusters Survey: A Radio Halo in a Massive Galaxy Cluster at z = 1.23</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current paradigm, high redshift radio halos are expected to be scarce due to inverse Compton energy losses and redshift dimming, which cause them to be intrinsically faint. This low occurrence fraction is predicted by cosmic ray electron turbulent re-acceleration models. To date, only a handful of radio halos have been detected at redshift z &gt; 0.8. We report the MeerKAT detection of a radio halo hosted by a galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0329.2-2330 at z = 1.23, making it the highest redshift halo detected thus far. Using L-band and UHF-band observations, we derive a radio halo spectral index of $\alpha^{1.3GHz}_{0.8GHz}$ = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.4 and a radio power of P$_{1.4GHz}$ = (4.4 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This result further confirms that there is rapid magnetic field amplification in galaxy clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Ultra-deep cover: an exotic and jetted tidal disruption event candidate disguised as a gamma-ray burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified as either short GRBs with durations $\lesssim 2$ s that are powered by compact object mergers, or long GRBs with durations $\gtrsim 2$ s that powered by the deaths of massive stars. Recent results, however, have challenged this dichotomy and suggest that there exists a population of merger-driven long bursts. One such example, GRB 191019A, has a $t_{90} \approx 64$ s but many of its other properties -- including its host galaxy, afterglow luminosity and lack of associated supernova -- are more consistent with a short GRB. Here we propose an alternative interpretation: that GRB 191019A (which is located in the nucleus of its host) is an atypical jetted tidal disruption event (TDE). In particular, we suggest the short timescale and rapid decline, not expected for standard TDEs, are the result of an "ultra-deep" encounter, in which the star came well within the tidal radius of the black hole and promptly self-intersected, circularised, accreted, and launched a relativistic outflow. This model reproduces the timescale and luminosity through a prompt super-Eddington accretion phase and accounts for the lack of late optical emission. This would make GRB 191019A only the fifth jetted TDE and the first discovered ultra-deep TDE. The ultra-deep TDE model can be distinguished from merger-driven long GRBs via the soft X-ray flash that results from prompt self-intersection of the debris stream; the detection of this flash will be possible with wide-field and soft-X-ray satellites such as $\textit{Einstein Probe}$ or $\textit{SVOM}$.</description>

      <title>Maximal mass of the neutron star with a deconfined quark core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of equation of state for the matter in the neutron star plays an important role in determining its maximal mass. In addition, it must comply with the condition of causality. Noting that the central density of a maximally massive neutron star is well above the nuclear saturation density, a deconfined quark core in the central region is motivated in this paper. We analyze this scenario by employing the MIT bag model to represent the core region and one of the unified equations of state for the region outside the core. Such combination is found to solve the problem of causality violation. In each case of the combined equations of state, the radial profile of $\rho r^2$ displays a peak and dominant contribution to the total mass of the star comes from the region around the peak value of $\rho r^2$, whereas the contribution is small from the regions near the center and the surface. This peak occurs in the region of hadronic matter for the combinations considered in this paper. Importantly, we find that the position of the peak in $\rho r^2$ is well-correlated with the maximal mass -- the highest value of $1.98\ M_\odot$ obtains for the case with the peak occurring farthest from the center. This gravitational threshold being obtained for a non-rotating neutron star, we expect the threshold to lie well above 2 $ M_\odot$ for a rapidly rotating neutron star, that may explain the existance of massive pulsars from recent astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Unified equations of state for cold nonaccreting neutron stars with Brussels-Montreal functionals. V. Improved parametrization of the nucleon density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We previously studied the inner crust and the pasta mantle of a neutron star within the 4th-order extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) approach with consistent proton shell corrections added perturbatively via the Strutinsky integral (SI) theorem together with the contribution due to pairing. To speed up the computations and avoid numerical problems, we adopted parametrized nucleon density distributions. However, the errors incurred by the choice of the parametrization are expected to become more significant as the mean baryon number density is increased, especially in the pasta mantle where the differences in the energy per nucleon of the different phases are very small, typically a few keV. To improve the description of these exotic structures, we discuss the important features that a nuclear profile should fulfill and introduce two new parametrizations. Performing calculations using the BSk24 functional, we find that these parametrizations lead to lower ETF energy solutions for all pasta phases than the parametrization we adopted before and more accurately reproduce the exact equilibrium nucleon density distributions obtained from unconstrained variational calculations. Within the ETFSI method, all parametrizations predict the same composition in the region with quasi-spherical clusters. However, the two new parametrizations lead to a different mantle structure at mean baryon densities above about 0.07 fm^-3, at which point lasagna is energetically favored. Interestingly, spherical clusters reappear in the pasta region. The inverted pasta phases such as bucatini and Swiss cheese are still found in the densest region above the core in all cases.</description>

Abstract: The recent 230 GHz observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration are able to image the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy showing the shadow of the black hole, photon ring, and a ring-like structure that agrees with thermal synchrotron emission from the accretion disc. However, at lower frequencies, M87 is characterized by a large-scale jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. It is necessary to explore the impacts of non-thermal emission on black hole shadow images and extended jets, especially at lower frequencies. In this study, we aim to compare models with different electron heating prescriptions to one another and to investigate how these prescriptions and non-thermal electron distributions may affect black hole shadow images and broadband spectrum energy distribution function (SED). We perform general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) calculations in various two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models utilizing different black hole spins and different electron heating prescriptions coupling with different electron distribution functions (eDFs). Through the comparison with GRRT images and SEDs, we found that when considering variable kappa eDF, parameterized prescription of R-beta model with Rh = 1 is similar to the model with electron heating in the morphology of images, and the SEDs at the high-frequency. This is consistent with previous studies using thermal eDFs. However, the nuance between them could be differentiated through the diffuse extended structure seen in GRRT images, especially at a lower frequency, and the behavior of SEDs at low frequency. The emission from the nearside jet region is enhanced for reconnection heating case and it will increase if including the contribution from the regions with stronger magnetization or considering magnetic energy contribution to kappa eDF mainly in the magnetized regions.</description>

      <title>Study of mass outflow rates from magnetized advective accretion disk around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and discuss a model formalism to study the properties of mass outflows that are emerged out from a relativistic, magnetized, viscous, advective accretion flow around a rotating black hole. In doing so, we consider the toroidal component as the dominant magnetic fields and synchrotron process is the dominant cooling mechanism inside the accretion disk. With this, we self-consistently solve the coupled accretion-ejection governing equations in the steady state and obtain the shock-induced global inflow-outflow solutions in terms of the inflow parameters, namely plasma-$\beta$ ($=p_{\rm gas}/p_{\rm mag}$, $p_{\rm gas}$ and $p_{\rm mag}$ being gas and magnetic pressures), accretion rates ($\dot m$) and viscosity ($\alpha_{\rm B}$), respectively. Using these solutions, we compute the mass outflow rate ($R_{\dot m}$, the ratio of outflow to inflow mass flux) and find that mass loss from the magnetized accretion disk continues to take place for wide range of inflow parameters and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$). We also observe that $R_{\dot m}$ strongly depends on plasma-$\beta$, $\dot m$, $\alpha_{\rm B}$ and $a_{\rm k}$, and it increases as the magnetic activity inside the accretion disk is increased. Further, we compute the maximum mass outflow rate ($R^{\rm max}_{\dot m}$) by freely varying the inflow parameters and find that for magnetic pressure dominated disk, $R^{\rm max}_{\dot m} \sim 24\%$ ($\sim 30\%$) for $a_{\rm k}=0.0$ ($0.99$). Finally, while discussing the implication of our model formalism, we compute the maximum jet kinetic power using $R^{\rm max}_{\dot m}$ which appears to be in close agreement with the observed jet kinetic power of several black hole sources.</description>

      <title>Flickering pulsations in bright X-ray pulsars: the evidence of gravitationally lensed and eclipsed accretion column</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is expected that extreme mass accretion rate onto strongly magnetised neutron star results in appearance of accretion columns above stellar surface. For a distant observer, rotation of a star results in periodic variations of X-ray flux. Because the mass accretion rate fluctuates around the average value, the pulse profiles are not stable and demonstrate fluctuations as well. In the case of bright X-ray pulsars, however, pulse fluctuations are not solely attributed to variations in the mass accretion rate. They are also influenced by the variable height of the columns, which is dependent on the mass accretion rate. This study delves into the process of pulse profile formation in bright X-ray pulsars, taking into account stochastic fluctuations in the mass accretion rate, the corresponding variations in accretion column geometry and gravitational bending. Our analysis reveals that potential eclipses of accretion columns by a neutron star during their spin period should manifest specific features in pulse profile variability. Applying a novel pulse profile analysis technique, we successfully detect these features in the bright X-ray transient V0332+53 at luminosities $\gtrsim 2\times 10^{38}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. This detection serves as compelling evidence for the eclipse of an accretion column by a neutron star. Detection of the eclipse places constraints on the relation between neutron star mass, radius and accretion column height. Specifically, we can establish an upper limit on the accretion column height, which is crucial for refining theoretical models of extreme accretion.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Rastall Gravity: from low-mass HESS J1731-347 to high-mass PSR J0952-0607 pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to Rastall gravity we introduce matter-geometry nonminimal coupling which is proportional to the gradient of quadratic curvature invariants. Those are mimicking the conformal trace anomaly when backreaction of the quantum fields to a curved spacetime geometry is considered. We consider a static spherically symmetric stellar structure with anisotropic fluid and Krori-Barua metric potentials model to examine the theory. Confronting the model with NICER+XMM-Newton observational constraints on the pulsar PSR J0740$+$6620 quantifies the amount of the nonminimal coupling via a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon\simeq -0.01$. We verify that the conformal symmetry is broken everywhere inside the pulsar as the trace anomaly $\Delta&gt;0$, or equivalently the trace of the stress-energy tensor $\mathfrak{T}&lt;0$, whereas the adiabatic sound speed does not violate the conjecture conformal upper limit $v_r^2/c^2 = 1/3$. The maximum compactness accordingly is $C_\text{max}=0.752$ which is $4\%$ higher than GR. Notably, if the conformal sound speed constraint is hold, observational data excludes $\epsilon \geq 0$ up to $\geq 1.6\sigma$. The stellar model is consistent with the self-bound structure with soft linear equation of state. Investigating possible connection with MIT bag model of strange quarks sets physical bounds from microscopic physics which confirm the negative value of the parameter $\epsilon$. We estimate a radius $R=13.21 \pm 0.96$ km of the most massive observed compact star PSR J0952$-$0607 with $M=2.35\pm0.17 M_\odot$. Finally, we show that the corresponding mass-radius diagram fits well lowest-mass pulsar HESS J1731$-$347 and highest-mass pulsar PSR J0952$-$0607 ever observed as well as the intermediate mass range as obtained by NICER and LIGO/Virgo observations.</description>

      <title>Probing the Circumstellar Environment of highly luminous type IIn SN ASASSN-14il</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present long-term photometric and spectroscopic studies of Circumstellar Material (CSM)-Ejecta interacting supernova (SN) ASASSN-14il in the galaxy PGC 3093694. The SN reaches a peak $r$-band magnitude of $\sim$ $-20.3 \pm 0.2$ mag rivaling SN 2006tf and SN 2010jl. The multiband and the pseudo-bolometric lightcurve show a plateau lasting $\sim 50$ days. Semi-analytical CSM interaction models can match the high luminosity and decline rates of the lightcurves but fail to faithfully represent the plateau region and the bumps in the lightcurves. The spectral evolution resembles the typical SNe IIn dominated by CSM interaction, showing blue-continuum and narrow Balmer lines. The lines are dominated by electron scattering at early epochs. The signatures of the underlying ejecta are visible as the broad component in the H$\alpha$ profile from as early as day 50, hinting at asymmetry in the CSM. A narrow component is persistent throughout the evolution. The SN shows remarkable photometric and spectroscopic similarity with SN 2015da. However, the different polarization in ASASSN-14il compared to SN 2015da suggests an alternative viewing angle. The late-time blueshift in the H$\alpha$ profiles supports dust formation in the post-shock CSM or ejecta. The mass-loss rate of 2-7 M$_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ suggests a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) progenitor in an eruptive phase for ASASSN-14il.</description>

      <title>Observation of Gravitational Waves from the Coalescence of a $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ Compact Object and a Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a coalescing compact binary with component masses $2.5-4.5~M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0~M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible level). The gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 was observed during the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network on 2023 May 29 by the LIGO Livingston Observatory. The primary component of the source has a mass less than $5~M_\odot$ at 99% credibility. We cannot definitively determine from gravitational-wave data alone whether either component of the source is a neutron star or a black hole. However, given existing estimates of the maximum neutron star mass, we find the most probable interpretation of the source to be the coalescence of a neutron star with a black hole that has a mass between the most massive neutron stars and the least massive black holes observed in the Galaxy. We estimate a merger rate density of $55^{+127}_{-47}~\text{Gpc}^{-3}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star-black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources constitute about 60% of the total merger rate inferred for neutron star-black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star-black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.</description>

      <title>Kpc-Scale Neutral Iron K$\alpha$ Emission in the Starburst-AGN NGC 4945: a Relic AGN Outflow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 4945 contains a well-known heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its core, with prior reports of strong nuclear and off-nuclear neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission due to the AGN activity. We report the discovery of very extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission with the XMM-Newton EPIC pn in a $\sim5$ kpc by $\sim10$ kpc region that is misaligned with the plane of the inclined optical galaxy disk by $\sim60$ degrees in projection. After a careful consideration of the crowded center of the galaxy and numerous unresolved hard X-ray sources present, we estimate that $\sim15$% of the Fe K$\alpha$ is extended on kpc-sized scales. The overall size and misalignment of the region follows an unusual pattern of radio polarization that is not typical of starbursts or normal disk galaxies but has been interpreted as possibly due to AGN activity. We suggest that the extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission arose from a period of AGN eruption several million years ago - a relic of a past AGN ejection episode.</description>

      <title>Super-extremal black holes in the quasitopological electromagnetic field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a simple generalization of electromagnetism, referred to as quasitopological electromagnetic field theory, is characterized by the presence of dyonic black-hole solutions of the Einstein field equations that, in certain parameter regions, are characterized by four horizons. In the present compact paper we reveal the existence, in this non-linear electrodynamic field theory, of super-extremal black-hole spacetimes that are characterized by the four degenerate functional relations $[g_{00}(r)]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[dg_{00}(r)/dr]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^2g_{00}(r)/dr^2]_ {r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^3g_{00}(r)/dr^3]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=0$, where $g_{00}(r)$ is the $tt$-component of the curved line element and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the black-hole horizon radius. In particular, using analytical techniques we prove that the quartically degenerate super-extremal black holes are characterized by the universal (parameter-{\it independent}) dimensionless compactness parameter $M/r_{\text{H}}={2\over3}(2\gamma+1)$, where $\gamma\equiv{_2F_1}(1/4,1;5/4;-3)$.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the Origin of Detectable Cataclysmic Variables in Globular Clusters: Testing the Importance of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the current detectable cataclysmic variable (CV) population in Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we show that there is not a clear relation between the number of sources per unit of mass and the stellar encounter rate, the cluster mass, or the cluster central density. If any, only in the case of core-collapsed GCs could there be an anticorrelation with the stellar encounter rate. Our findings contrast with previous studies where clear positive correlations were identified. Our results suggest that correlations between faint X-ray sources, from which often conclusions for the CV population are drawn, and the GC parameters considered here, are likely influenced by other type of X-ray sources, including other types of compact binaries, which have X-ray luminosities similar to CVs. The findings presented here also suggest that the role of primordial systems is more important than previously believed and that dynamical formation has less influence in the current detectable CV population. The long-standing paradigm that GCs are efficient factories of CVs formed via dynamical interactions does not seem to be supported by current observations.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a discriminator for horizons in equatorial eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal heating in a binary black hole system is driven by the absorption of energy and angular momentum by the black hole's horizon. Previous works have shown that this phenomenon becomes particularly significant during the late stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) into a rapidly spinning massive black hole, a key focus for future low-frequency gravitational-wave observations by (for instance) the LISA mission. Past analyses have largely focused on quasi-circular inspiral geometry, with some of the most detailed studies looking at equatorial cases. Though useful for illustrating the physical principles, this limit is not very realistic astrophysically, since the population of EMRI events is expected to arise from compact objects scattered onto relativistic orbits in galactic centers through many-body events. In this work, we extend those results by studying the importance of tidal heating in equatorial EMRIs with generic eccentricities. Our results suggest that accurate modeling of tidal heating is crucial to prevent significant dephasing and systematic errors in EMRI parameter estimation. We examine a phenomenological model for EMRIs around exotic compact objects by parameterizing deviations from the black hole picture in terms of the fraction of radiation absorbed compared to the BH case. Based on a mismatch calculation we find that reflectivities as small as $|\mathcal{R}|^2 \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ are distinguishable from the BH case, irrespective of the value of the eccentricity. We stress, however, that this finding should be corroborated by future parameter estimation studies.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Analysis of Three-Dimensional Anisotropy in Imbalanced Alfv\'enic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze in-situ observations of imbalanced solar wind turbulence to evaluate MHD turbulence models grounded in "Critical Balance" (CB) and "Scale-Dependent Dynamic Alignment" (SDDA). At energy injection scales, both outgoing and ingoing modes exhibit a weak cascade; a simultaneous tightening of SDDA is noted. Outgoing modes persist in a weak cascade across the inertial range, while ingoing modes shift to a strong cascade at $\lambda \approx 3 \times 10^{4} d_i$, with associated spectral scalings deviating from expected behavior due to "anomalous coherence" effects. The inertial range comprises two distinct sub-inertial segments. Beyond $\lambda \gtrsim 100 d_i$, eddies adopt a field-aligned tube topology, with SDDA signatures mainly evident in high amplitude fluctuations. The scaling exponents $\zeta_{n}$ of the $n$-th order conditional structure functions, orthogonal to both the local mean field and fluctuation direction, align with the analytical models of Chandran et al. 2015 and Mallet et al. 2017, indicating "multifractal" statistics and strong intermittency; however, scaling in parallel and displacement components is more concave than predicted, possibly influenced by expansion effects. Below $\lambda \approx 100 d_i$, eddies become increasingly anisotropic, evolving into thin current sheet-like structures. Concurrently, $\zeta_{n}$ scales linearly with order, marking a shift towards "monofractal" statistics. At $\lambda \approx 8 d_i$, the increase in aspect ratio halts, and the eddies become quasi-isotropic. This change may signal tearing instability, leading to reconnection, or result from energy redirection into the ion-cyclotron wave spectrum, aligning with the "helicity barrier". Our analysis utilizes 5-point structure functions, proving more effective than the traditional 2-point method in capturing steep scaling behaviors at smaller scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.09211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present detailed microscopic simulations of high-energy cosmic-ray air showers penetrating high-altitude ice layers that can be found at the polar regions. We use a combination of the CORSIKA Monte Carlo code and the Geant4 simulation toolkit, and focus on the particle cascade that develops in the ice to describe its most prominent features. We discuss the impact of the ice layer on the total number of particles in function of depth of the air shower, and we give a general parameterization of the charge distribution in the cascade front in function of Xmax of the cosmic ray air shower, which can be used for analytical and semi-analytical calculations of the expected Askaryan radio emission of the in-ice particle cascade. We show that the core of the cosmic ray air shower dominates during the propagation in ice, therefore creating an in-ice particle cascade strongly resembling a neutrino-induced particle cascade. Finally, we present the results of microscopic simulations of the Askaryan radio emission of the in-ice particle cascade, showing that the emission is dominated by the shower core, and discuss the feasibility of detecting the plasma created by the particle cascade in the ice using RADAR echo techniques.</description>

      <title>Neutrino follow-up with the Zwicky Transient Facility: Results from the first 24 campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) performs a systematic neutrino follow-up program, searching for optical counterparts to high-energy neutrinos with dedicated Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observations. Since first light in March 2018, ZTF has taken prompt observations for 24 high-quality neutrino alerts from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, with a median latency of 12.2 hours from initial neutrino detection. From two of these campaigns, we have already reported tidal disruption event (TDE) AT 2019dsg and likely TDE AT 2019fdr as probable counterparts, suggesting that TDEs contribute &gt;7.8% of the astrophysical neutrino flux. We here present the full results of our program through to December 2021. No additional candidate neutrino sources were identified by our program, allowing us to place the first constraints on the underlying optical luminosity function of astrophysical neutrino sources. Transients with optical absolutes magnitudes brighter that $-21$ can contribute no more than 87% of the total, while transients brighter than $-22$ can contribute no more than 58% of the total, neglecting the effect of extinction and assuming they follow the star formation rate. These are the first observational constraints on the neutrino emission of bright populations such as superluminous supernovae. None of the neutrinos were coincident with bright optical AGN flares comparable to that observed for TXS 0506+056/IC170922A, with such optical blazar flares producing no more than 26% of the total neutrino flux. We highlight the outlook for electromagnetic neutrino follow-up programs, including the expected potential for the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Mapping the AMS-02 and CALET Data onto the Source Spectra and Residence Times of Galactic Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent measurements of the spectral intensities of cosmic-ray nuclei have suggested that the ratio of Boron to Carbon nuclei, $R(E)$, comprises two components, $R_1(E)$ which carries all of the energy dependence and the other $R_A$, a constant independent of energy per nucleon. This finding supports the earlier theoretical expectations and results of gamma-ray astronomy that one of these components is attributable to spallation in a cocoon like region surrounding the sources and the other in the general interstellar medium before cosmic rays leak away from the Galaxy. A new model-independent way of analyzing cosmic-ray spectra is presented here to shed light on the recent findings: Imposing the single constraint that the source function of B nuclei is minimal we use a cascade of rate equations to map point-by-point the observed cosmic ray spectra of p, B, C, O and Fe on to their source spectra and the two life-times of cosmic rays $\tau_G$ in the Galaxy and $\tau_S$ in the cocoons surrounding the sources. The model independent results show that the appropriate choice is $\tau_S(E)$ is responsible for $R_1(E)$ and the source spectra are power laws with indices of $\sim-2.7$.</description>

      <title>A 3D Diffusive and Advective Model of Electron Transport Applied to the Pulsar Wind Nebula HESS J1825-137</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HESS J1825-137 is one of the most powerful and luminous TeV gamma-ray pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe), making it an excellent laboratory to study particle transportation around pulsars. We present a model of the (diffusive and advective) transport and radiative losses of electrons from the pulsar PSRJ1826-1334 powering HESSJ1825-137 using interstellar medium gas (ISM) data, soft photon fields and a spatially varying magnetic field. We find that for the characteristic age of 21 kyr, PSR J1826-1334 is unable to meet the energy requirements to match the observed X-ray and gamma-ray emission. An older age of 40 kyr, together with an electron conversion efficiency of 0.14 and advective flow of $v = 0.002c$, can reproduce the observed multi-wavelengh emission towards HESS J1825-137. A turbulent ISM with magnetic field of $B = 20\,{\mu}G$ to $60\,{\mu}G$ to the north of HESS J1825-137 (as suggested by ISM observations) is required to prevent significant gamma-ray contamination towards the northern TeV source HESS J1826-130.</description>

      <title>Curvature in the very-high energy gamma-ray spectrum of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radio galaxy M87 is a variable very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray source, exhibiting three major flares reported in 2005, 2008, and 2010. Despite extensive studies, the origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission is yet to be understood. In this study, we investigate the VHE gamma-ray spectrum of M87 during states of high gamma-ray activity, utilizing 20.2$\,$ hours the H.E.S.S. observations. Our findings indicate a preference for a curved spectrum, characterized by a log-parabola model with extra-galactic background light (EBL) model above 0.3$\,$TeV at the 4$\sigma$ level, compared to a power-law spectrum with EBL. We investigate the degeneracy between the absorption feature and the EBL normalization and derive upper limits on EBL models mainly sensitive in the wavelength range 12.4$\,$$\mu$m - 40$\,$$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Nature of Gravitational-Wave Emission in Core-collapse Supernovae with Perturbative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can provide crucial information about the central engines of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In order to unveil the nature of GW emission in CCSNe, we apply perturbative analyses with the same underlying equations as simulations to diagnose oscillations of the proto-neutron star (PNS) during $\sim$1 s postbounce. In the pseudo-Newtonian case, we find that radial profiles of GW emission match well between the perturbative analysis with $l=2$ and simulations inside the PNS at \emph{any} frequency and time. This confirms that the GW emission of CCSNe arises from the global PNS oscillations in the perturbative regime. Based on this, we solve for the discrete eigenmodes with a free PNS surface and tentatively identify a set of $g$ modes and the $f$ mode contributing to the peak GW emission. We also offer a possible explanation for the power gap in the GW spectrum found in simulations that lies at the frequency with vanishing cumulative emission of the PNS. Our results enhance the predictive power of perturbative analyses in the GW signals of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous millisecond-duration radio pulses with extragalactic origin, which were discovered more than a decade ago. Despite the numerous samples, the physical origin of FRBs remains poorly understood. FRBs have been thought to originate from young magnetars or accreting compact objects (COs). Massive stars or COs are predicted to be embedded in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The dense disk absorbs FRBs severely, making them difficult to observe. However, progenitors ejecta or outflow feedback from the accreting COs interact with the disk material to form a cavity. The existence of the cavity can reduce the absorption by the dense disk materials, making FRBs escape. Here we investigate the production and propagation of FRBs in AGN disks and find that the AGN environments lead to the following unique observational properties, which can be verified in future observation. First, the dense material in the disk can cause large dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM). Second, the toroidal magnetic field in the AGN disk can cause Faraday conversion. Third, during the shock breakout, DM and RM show non-power-law evolution patterns over time. Fourth, for accreting-powered models, higher accretion rates lead to more bright bursts in AGN disks, accounting for up to 1% of total bright repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{tdescore}$: An Accurate Photometric Classifier for Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical surveys have become increasingly adept at identifying candidate Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in large numbers, but classifying these generally requires extensive spectroscopic resources. Here we present $\texttt{tdescore}$, a simple binary photometric classifier that is trained using a systematic census of $\sim$3000 nuclear transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The sample is highly imbalanced, with TDEs representing $\sim$2% of the total. $\texttt{tdescore}$ is nonetheless able to reject non-TDEs with 99.6% accuracy, yielding a sample of probable TDEs with recall of 77.5% for a precision of 80.2%. $\texttt{tdescore}$ is thus substantially better than any available TDE photometric classifier scheme in the literature, with performance not far from spectroscopy as a method for classifying ZTF nuclear transients, despite relying solely on ZTF data and multi-wavelength catalogue cross-matching. In a novel extension, we use `SHapley Additive exPlanations' ($\texttt{SHAP}$) to provide a human-readable justification for each individual $\texttt{tdescore}$ classification, enabling users to understand and form opinions about the underlying classifier reasoning. $\texttt{tdescore}$ can serve as a model for photometric identification of TDEs with time-domain surveys, such as the upcoming Rubin observatory.</description>
