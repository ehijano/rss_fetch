      <title>Three-Dimensional Venus Cloud Structure Simulated by a General Circulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clouds have a great impact on Venus's energy budget and climate evolution, but its three-dimensional structure is still not well understood. Here we incorporate a simple Venus cloud physics scheme into a flexible GCM to investigate the three-dimensional cloud spatial variability. Our simulations show good agreement with observations in terms of the vertical profiles of clouds and H2SO4 vapor. H2O vapor is overestimated above the clouds due to efficient transport in the cloud region. The cloud top decreases as latitude increases, qualitatively consistent with Venus Express observations. The underlying mechanism is the combination of H2SO4 chemical production and meridional circulation. The mixing ratios of H2SO4 at 50-60 km and H2O vapors in the main cloud deck basically exhibit maxima around the equator, due to the effect of temperature's control on the saturation vapor mixing ratios of the two species. The cloud mass distribution is subject to both H2SO4 chemical production and dynamical transport and shows a pattern that peaks around the equator in the upper cloud while peaks at mid-high latitudes in the middle cloud. At low latitudes, H2SO4 and H2O vapors, cloud mass loading and acidity show semidiurnal variations at different altitude ranges, which can be validated against future missions. Our model emphasizes the complexity of the Venus climate system and the great need for more observations and simulations to unravel its spatial variability and underlying atmospheric and/or geological processes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Empirical Solar Energetic Particle Scaling Relations II. Coronal Mass Ejections</title>

Abstract: Aims. The space radiation environment conditions and the maximum expected coronal mass ejection (CME) speed are being assessed through the investigation of scaling laws between the peak proton flux and fluence of Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events with the speed of the CMEs. Methods. We utilize a complete catalog of SEP events, covering the last ~25 years of CME observations (i.e. 1997 to 2017). We calculate the peak proton fluxes and integrated event fluences for those events reaching an integral energy of up to E&gt; 100 MeV, covering the period of the last ~25 years of CME observations. For a sample of 38 strong SEP events, we first investigate the statistical relations between the recorded peak proton fluxes (IP) and fluences (FP) at a set of integral energies of E &gt;10 MeV, E&gt;30 MeV, E&gt;60 MeV, and E&gt;100 MeV versus the projected CME speed near the Sun (VCME) obtained by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO). Based on the inferred relations, we further calculate the integrated energy dependence of both IP and FP, assuming that they follow an inverse power-law with respect to energy. By making use of simple physical assumptions, we combine our derived scaling laws to estimate the upper limits for VCME, IP, and FP focusing on two cases of known extreme SEP events that occurred on February 23, 1956 (GLE05) and in AD774/775, respectively. Given physical constraints and assumptions, several options for the upper limit VCME, associated with these events, are investigated. Results. A scaling law relating IP and FP to the CME speed as V^{5}CME for CMEs ranging between ~3400-5400 km/s is consistent with values of FP inferred for the cosmogenic nuclide event of AD774/775. At the same time, the upper CME speed that the current Sun can provide possibly falls within an upper limit of VCME &lt;= 5500 km/s.</description>
