      <title>Optimising cryptocurrency portfolios through stable clustering of price correlation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging cryptocurrency market presents unique challenges for investment due to its unregulated nature and inherent volatility. However, collective price movements can be explored to maximise profits with minimal risk using investment portfolios. In this paper, we develop a technical framework that utilises historical data on daily closing prices and integrates network analysis, price forecasting, and portfolio theory to identify cryptocurrencies for building profitable portfolios under uncertainty. Our method utilises the Louvain network community algorithm and consensus clustering to detect robust and temporally stable clusters of highly correlated cryptocurrencies, from which the chosen cryptocurrencies are selected. A price prediction step using the ARIMA model guarantees that the portfolio performs well for up to 14 days in the investment horizon. Empirical analysis over a 5-year period shows that despite the high volatility in the crypto market, hidden price patterns can be effectively utilised to generate consistently profitable, time-agnostic cryptocurrency portfolios.</description>

      <title>Universe in a rotating black hole and preferred axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.10819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If our universe was born as a baby universe on the other side of the event horizon of a black hole existing in a parent universe, then the corresponding white hole at rest provides the absolute frame of reference in the universe. In this frame, the cosmic microwave background radiation is isotropic on large scales. If the parent black hole is rotating, then its axis of rotation becomes a preferred axis in the universe. Accordingly, the absolute frame is non-inertial, although the non-inertial forces are small. To decrease their energies, galaxies tend to align their axes of rotation with the preferred axis, resulting in clockwise-counterclockwise asymmetry. The centrifugal force causes a large-scale bulk flow of galaxy clusters in directions perpendicular to the preferred axis. The astronomical data seem to support these motions. The angular velocity of the universe decreases as the universe expands, which is a consequence of the conservation of the angular momentum of the universe. The centrifugal force in a rotating universe, which also decreases, may be the origin of dark energy, in accordance with recent DES observations showing that dark energy becomes weaker with time.</description>

      <title>The possibility for panspermia in the galaxy by means of planetary dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04990v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By obtaining the assumption that planetary dust particles can escape from the gravitational attraction of a planet, we consider the possibility for the dust grains to leave the star's system by means of the radiation pressure. By taking the typical dust parameters into account, we consider their dynamics and show that they can reach the deep cosmos, taking part in panspermia. It has been shown that, during $5$ billion years, the dust grains will reach $10^5$ stellar systems, and by taking the Drake equation into account, it has been shown that the whole galaxy will be full of planetary dust particles.</description>
