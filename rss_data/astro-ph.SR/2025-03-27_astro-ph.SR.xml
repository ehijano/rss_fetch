      <title>Spectroscopic Follow-Up of Candidate Runaway Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway stars are characterized by higher space velocities than typical field stars. They are presumed to have been ejected from their birth places by one or more energetic mechanisms, including supernova explosions. Accurate radial velocities are essential for investigating their origin, by tracing back their Galactic orbits to look for close encounters in space and in time with neutron stars and young associations. While most studies of runaways have focused on OB stars, later-type stars have also been considered on occasion. Here we report the results of a long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring program with the goal of providing accurate radial velocities for 188 runaway candidates of spectral type A and later, proposed by Tetzlaff et al. (2011). We obtained multiple measurements over a period of about 13 yr to guard against the possibility that some may be members of binary or multiple systems, adding archival observations going back another 25 yr in some cases. We report new spectroscopic orbital solutions for more than three dozen systems. Many more are also found to be binaries based on available astrometric information. A small-scale study carried out here to trace back the paths of our targets together with those of four well-studied, optically-visible neutron stars among the so-called Magnificent Seven, resulted in no credible encounters.</description>

      <title>Variability of Galactic blue supergiants observed with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue supergiants (BSGs) mediate between the main sequence and the late stages of massive stars, which makes them valuable for assessing the physics that drives the stars across the diverse evolutionary channels. By exploring correlations between the parameters of BSGs and their variability properties, we aim to improve the constraints on the models of the evolved star structure and on the physics of the post-main-sequence evolution. We conducted a variability study of 41 BSGs with known spectroscopic parameters in the Galaxy using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We described the time domain of the stars by means of three statistical measures and extracted frequencies via iterative pre-whitening. Alongside, we investigated the stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability, which manifests itself in all amplitude spectra. We report a positive correlation between the amplitude of variability and the stellar luminosity. For log(L/L$_{\odot}\lesssim 5$), stars display frequencies that match the rotational one, suggesting that variability is driven by surface spots and/or features embedded in the wind. For log(L/L$_{\odot}\gtrsim 5$), variables of the $\alpha$ Cyg class manifest themselves with their diverse and/or time-variant properties. Moreover, we report a positive correlation between the SLF variability amplitude and $T_{\rm eff}$, indicating an influential role that the stellar age plays on the emergence of the background signal beyond the main sequence. Positive, though weak, correlation is observed between the intrinsic brightness and the SLF variability amplitude, similar to the findings in the Large Magellanic Cloud, which suggests an in common excitation mechanism that depends only mildly on metallicity. Exceptionally, the $\alpha$ Cyg variables display a suppressed SLF variability that prompts to the interior changes that the evolving stars undergo.</description>

      <title>3D Simulations Demonstrate Propagating Thermohaline Convection for Polluted White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polluted white dwarfs (WDs) with small surface convection zones deposit significant concentrations of heavy elements to the underlying radiative interior, presumably driving thermohaline convection. Current models of polluted WDs frequently fail to account for this effect, although its inclusion can increase the inferred accretion rate by orders of magnitude. It has been argued that this instability cannot be treated as a continuous mixing process and thus should not be considered in these models. In this work, we study three-dimensional simulations of a thermohaline-unstable layer propagating into an underlying stable region, approximating the polluted WD scenario. We find that although thermohaline convection works to reduce driving gradients somewhat, the front continues to propagate and the system remains unstable. Importantly, the turbulent flux of metals broadly dominates over the diffusive flux in quantitative agreement with with existing mixing prescriptions implemented in some stellar evolution models (except slightly below the boundary of the propagating front, where recent prescriptions neglect overshoot-like effects). Thus, our results broadly support polluted WD models that include thermohaline mixing in their estimates of the settling rate.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Global Solar Convection with a Fully Compressible CHORUS++ Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial simulations of the solar convection zone using a fully compressible hydrodynamic CHORUS++ code and discuss preliminary analysis. Fluid dynamics simulation of the global solar convection is a critically important tool to access the dynamics of solar cycle variations. The CHORUS++ code robustly and efficiently solves the fully compressible hydrodynamic equations using a compact local spectral method and semi-unstructured grid system. Using CHORUS++, we simulate, for the first time, the solar convection shell from 0.7 to 0.99 of the solar radius, using the actual values of the total luminosity and the sidereal rotation rate. The simulation results include the longitudinally averaged rotation rate, reasonably agreeing with the observed solar-type differential rotation. The divergence of simulated mass flux infers that the anelastic-type models are appropriate for modeling the global solar convection, except for the outermost part of the Sun, for which the temporal scale of density variation is estimated at an order of days. The spherical harmonics analysis yields that the horizontal flows are dominant in the large-scale structure, and the degree of the anisotropy of the plasma flow is rather small and constant for the small-scale structures and for a wide range of the radius.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Main Sequence: Binary Evolution Pathways to Blue Stragglers in the Gaia Era I. Galactic Open and Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The study of blue straggler stars (BSS) provides insight into the mechanisms of stellar mass exchange during binary stellar evolution and the complex gravitational interactions within dense stellar systems. In combination, they enhance our understanding of the possible life cycles of stars and the evolutionary pathways of star clusters.
  Aim. We study the populations of BSSs in 41 globular clusters (GCs) and 42 open clusters (OCs) adopting photometry, proper motion, and parallax from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3), confirming their cluster membership. We find a total of 4399 BSSs: all GCs show the presence of BSSs (3965 or ~90% of the sample), whereas only 42 out of 129 studied OCs show the presence of BSSs (434 or ~10% of the sample). Clusters younger than ~500 Myr do not host any BSSs.
  Methods. We derive their astrophysical parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and mass based on color-temperature relations, isochrone models and Gaia DR3 spectroscopy (if available). We find values for $T_{\rm eff}=(6800 \pm 585) \ {\rm K}$ and $(7570 \pm 1400) \ {\rm K}$; and an average mass of $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.02 \pm 0.1) \ {M_\odot}$ and $\langle M_{\rm BSS} \rangle = (1.75 \pm 0.45) \ {M_\odot}$ for GCs and OCs, respectively. We finally compute the difference of the BSS mass and the main sequence turn-off (MSTO) mass of its respective cluster, normalized by the MSTO mass, for every identified BSS.
  Results. Based on this parameter and BSSs ages derived from isochrone models, we find: i) GC BSSs that are most likely to be formed through collisions show a "boost" for ages ~ 1-2 Gyr, in agreement with ages for core-collapse events in GCs reported in previous studies; ii) a double sequence for GC BSSs that could indicate the hint of a pre/post-merger or close-binary scenario.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ADITYA L1, India's first dedicated mission to study Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on September 2, 2023 with seven payloads. Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on ADITYA-L1. VELC has provision to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in continuum at 5000{\AA}, with the field of view (FoV) from 1.05$R_\odot$ to 3$R_\odot$ can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303{\AA} [Fe XIV], 7892{\AA} [Fe XI], and 10747{\AA} [Fe XIII] are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50${\mu}$m, separated by 3.75mm helps to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to ${\pm}$1.5$R_\odot$ with variable step size. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747{\AA} also in the FoV range 1.05-1.5$R_\odot$. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time.Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>

      <title>Eruptivity of Flaring Active Regions Based on Electric Current Neutralization and Torus Instability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are frequently accompanied by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that release significant amount of energetic plasma into interplanetary space, potentially causing geomagnetic disturbances on Earth. However, many solar flares have no association with CMEs. The relationship between solar flare and CME occurrences remains unclear. Therefore, it is valuable to distinguish between active regions that potentially produce flares and CMEs and those that do not. It is believed that the eruptivity of a flare can be characterized by the properties of the active region from which it originates. In this study, we analyzed selected active regions that produced solar flares with and without CMEs during solar cycle 24. We carefully calculated the electric current neutralization of each active region by selecting relevant magnetic fluxes based on their connectivities using nonlinear force-free field models. Additionally, we analyzed their stabilities against the torus instability by estimating the proxies of critical heights of the active regions. We found that several non-eruptive active regions, which lacked clear signatures of neutral electric currents, exhibited a more apparent relationship with high critical heights of torus instability. Furthermore, we introduced a new non-dimensional parameter that incorporates current neutralization and critical height. We found that analysing ARs based on this new parameter can better discriminate eruptive and non-eruptive flare events compared to analysis that relied solely on current neutralization or torus instability. This indicates that torus instability analysis is necessary to complement electric current neutralization in characterizing the eruptivity of solar flares.</description>

      <title>ASR: Archival Solar flaRes catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares result from the rapid conversion of stored magnetic energy within the Sun's corona. These energy releases are associated with coronal magnetic loops, which are rooted in dense photospheric plasma and are passively transported by surface advection. Their emissions cover a wide range of wavelengths, with soft X-rays being the primary diagnostic for the past fifty years. Despite the efforts of multiple authors, we are still far from a complete theory, capable of explaining the observed statistical and individual properties of flares. Here, we exploit the availability of stable and long-term soft x-ray measurements from NASA's GOES mission to build a new solar flare catalogue, with a novel approach to linking sympathetic events. Furthermore, for the most energetic events since 2010, we have also provided a method to identify the origin of the observed flare and eventual link to the photospheric active region by exploiting the array of instruments onboard NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory. Our catalogue provides a robust resource for studying space weather events and training machine learning models to develop a reliable early warning system for the onset of eruptive events in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Timing Variations of Circumbinary Substellar Objects in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets and brown dwarfs form in complex gravitational environments, offering insights into formation, orbital stability, and habitability prospects. However, they remain underrepresented, with only 60 confirmed or candidate systems known. In this work, we leverage TESS photometry to search for circumbinary companions through eclipse timing variations (ETVs), analyzing 152 detached eclipsing binaries. By modeling eclipse timings, we identify 26 systems with significant periodic signals, 14 of which have false alarm probabilities below 0.01. While no detections are confirmed, TIC 350297040 emerges as a candidate for a circumbinary brown dwarf ($0.06~M_{\odot}$) under the assumption of a $1~M_{\odot}$ binary system, though further investigation is required. Simulations using synthetic ETVs indicate a 5\% recovery rate for circumbinary brown dwarfs and 0.1\% for Jupiter-like planets, with median masses of $56.6^{+16.5}{-23.4}~M_{\rm J}$ and periods of $1404^{+1361}_{-953}$ d. Our simulations show that the smallest detectable mass is $1.6~M_{\rm J}$ at a period of 1860 d and confirm that ETV methods are effective in detecting misaligned systems. In the absence of a detection, we set an upper limit of 40\% on the occurrence rate of circumbinary brown dwarfs at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level, while a confirmed single detection would imply an occurrence rate of 13.08\%. These constraints are consistent with previous abundance estimates for circumbinary brown dwarfs ($\lesssim6.5\%$) but motivate a larger sample size. Furthermore, the very low recovery rates provide insights into the debate on first- and second-generation planet formation around post-common envelope binaries.</description>

      <title>Broad Observational Perspectives Achieved by the Accreting White Dwarf Sciences in the XMM-Newton and Chandra Eras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accreting white dwarf binaries (AWDs) comprise cataclysmic variables (CVs), symbiotics, AM CVns, and other related systems that host a primary white dwarf (WD) accreting from a main sequence or evolved companion star. AWDs are a product of close binary evolution; thus, they are important for understanding the evolution and population of X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and other galaxies. AWDs are essential for studying astrophysical plasmas under different conditions along with accretion physics and processes, transient events, matter ejection and outflows, compact binary evolution, mergers, angular momentum loss mechanisms, and nuclear processes leading to explosions. AWDs are also closely related to other objects in the late stages of stellar evolution, with other accreting objects in compact binaries, and even share common phenomena with young stellar objects, active galactic nuclei, quasars, and supernova remnants. As X-ray astronomy came to a climax with the start of the Chandra and XMM-Newton missions owing to their unprecedented instrumentation, new excellent imaging capabilities, good time resolution, and X-ray grating technologies allowed immense advancement in many aspects of astronomy and astrophysics. In this review, we lay out a panorama of developments on the study of AWDs that have been accomplished and have been made possible by these two observatories; we summarize the key observational achievements and the challenges ahead.</description>

      <title>ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging Survey of Ophiuchus Class I/Flat Spectrum/II Disks -- I: Discovery of New Disk Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on Class I, Flat Spectrum (FS), and Class II disks in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, a nearby active star-forming region with numerous young stellar objects (YSOs), to unveil signs of substructure formation in these disks. We employ two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling (SpM) for ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data, achieving images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au (0".02-0".2) for 78 dust disks, all of which are spatially resolved. In our sample, we confirm that approximately 30-40% of the disks exhibit substructures, and we identify new substructures in 15 disks (4 Class I, 7 Class FS, and 4 Class II objects). Compared to the eDisk sample in terms of bolometric temperature, Tbol, our targets are in a relatively later accretion phase. By combining our targets with the eDisk sample, we confirm that substructure detection in available data is restricted to objects where Tbol exceeds 200-300 K and the dust disk radius, Rdust, is larger than ~30 au. Moreover, we find that the distribution of inclination angles for Class II disks has a deficit of high values and is not consistent with being random. Analyzing molecular line emission data around these objects will be crucial to constrain disk evolutionary stages further and understand when and how substructures form.</description>

      <title>Optical Observations of the High Mass X-ray Binary MAXI J0709$-$159/LY CMa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the optical spectroscopic monitoring of the X-ray transient MAXI J0709$-$159 (identified as the Be star LY CMa) performed for about 1.5 months after the X-ray detection with MAXI. The observed spectrum showed a double-peaked H$\alpha$ line with a peak-to-peak separation of $\sim 230$ km s$^{-1}$, suggestive of the Be disk origin. We also detected a broad wing of the H$\alpha$ line with a line-of-sight velocity of $\gtrsim 900$ km s$^{-1}$, which could be explained by the accretion disk of the compact object or a stellar wind from the Be star. Initially the H$\alpha$ line showed an asymmetric profile with an enhanced blue peak, and then the blue peak decreased in $\sim$ 3 weeks to a similar strength to the red peak. We suggest that the evolution of the blue peak is associated with the X-ray activity and generated by the turbulence of the Be disk due to the passage of the compact object. We also investigated flux variation using the archival TESS data and found quasi-periodic variations with frequencies of $\sim 1$ and $\sim 2$ day$^{-1}$, which were likely caused by the pulsation of the B star. The overall variability properties on timescales of $\sim$ day were similar to those in Be X-ray binaries, rather than supergiant X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Power of Uncertainty: A Journey into Bayesian Neural Networks for Stellar dating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Astronomy and astrophysics demand rigorous handling of uncertainties to ensure the credibility of outcomes. The growing integration of artificial intelligence offers a novel avenue to address this necessity. This convergence presents an opportunity to create advanced models capable of quantifying diverse sources of uncertainty and automating complex data relationship exploration.
  What: We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian architecture whose probabilistic relationships are modeled by neural networks, designed to forecast stellar attributes such as mass, radius, and age (our main target). This architecture handles both observational uncertainties stemming from measurements and epistemic uncertainties inherent in the predictive model itself. As a result, our system generates distributions that encapsulate the potential range of values for our predictions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their variability and robustness.
  Methods: Our focus is on dating main sequence stars using a technique known as Chemical Clocks, which serves as both our primary astronomical challenge and a model prototype. In this work, we use hierarchical architectures to account for correlations between stellar parameters and optimize information extraction from our dataset. We also employ Bayesian neural networks for their versatility and flexibility in capturing complex data relationships.
  Results: By integrating our machine learning algorithm into a Bayesian framework, we have successfully propagated errors consistently and managed uncertainty treatment effectively, resulting in predictions characterized by broader uncertainty margins. This approach facilitates more conservative estimates in stellar dating. Our architecture achieves age predictions with a mean absolute error of less than 1 Ga for the stars in the test dataset.</description>

      <title>The ESO SupJup Survey VII: Clouds and line asymmetries in CRIRES$^+$ J-band spectra of the Luhman 16 binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs at the L-T transition likely experience an inhomogeneous clearing of the clouds in their atmospheres. The resulting surface of thin and thick cloudy patches has been put forward to explain the observed variability, J-band brightening, and re-emergence of FeH absorption. We study the closest brown dwarf binary, Luhman 16A and B, in an effort to constrain their chemical and cloud compositions. As this binary consists of an L7.5 and T0.5 component, we gain insight into the atmospheric properties at the L-T transition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we observed Luhman 16AB at high spectral resolution in the J-band ($1.1-1.4\ \mathrm{\mu m}$) using CRIRES$^+$. To analyse the spectra, we employ an atmospheric retrieval framework, coupling the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS with the MultiNest sampling algorithm. For both objects, we report detections of H$_2$O, K, Na, FeH, and, for the first time in the J-band, hydrogen-fluoride (HF). The K doublet at $1250\ \mathrm{nm}$ shows asymmetric absorption in the blue line wings, which are reproduced via pressure- and temperature-dependent shifts of the line cores. We find evidence for clouds in both spectra and we place constraints on an FeH-depletion in the Luhman 16A photosphere. The inferred over-abundance of FeH for Luhman 16B opposes its predicted rainout into iron clouds. A two-column model, which emulates the patchy surface expected at the L-T transition, is weakly preferred ($\sim 1.8\sigma$) for component B but disfavoured for A ($\sim 5.5\sigma$). The results suggest a uniform surface on Luhman 16A, which is in good agreement with the reduced variability observed for this L-type component. While the presented evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about any inhomogeneity on Luhman 16B, future observations covering a broader wavelength range could help to test the cloud-clearing hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Expectation for the MeV Gamma-Ray Emission from Pair-Instability Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are predicted thermonuclear explosions of massive stars with helium core masses exceeding $\sim 65M_\odot$ and synthesize substantial amounts of radioactive $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}$ ($M(\mathrm{^{56}Ni})\sim60M_\odot$ in extreme cases). To investigate their observational signatures, we developed a 1D Monte Carlo radiation transport code and performed simulations of gamma-ray and hard X-ray emissions from the decay chain $\mathrm{^{56}Ni}\to\mathrm{^{56}Co}\to\mathrm{^{56}Fe}$. We find that key gamma-ray lines (847 and 1238 keV) from $\mathrm{^{56}Co}$ decay in the $130M_\odot$ helium core model can be detected up to 300-400 Mpc by next-generation MeV gamma-ray telescopes. In contrast, the signals from the $100M_\odot$ model remain below the detection limits. Our results provide the template for gamma-ray follow-up observations of PISNe. Considering theoretical predictions and observational constraints, we estimate PISN event rates within 300 Mpc to be approximately 0.1 events per year, highlighting their rarity but also emphasizing their feasibility as targets for future gamma-ray observations over the decade.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications (I). A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate efficiently the radiative transfer equation (RTE), but current methods are local, i.e. limited to constant propagation matrices. This paper introduces a formalism for non-local integration of the RTE using the Magnus expansion. We begin by framing the problem in terms of rotations within the Lorentz / Poincare group (Stokes formalism), motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. By combining the latter with a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix, we derive a compact analytical evolution operator that supports arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix and allows to increasingly consider any order in the Magnus expansion. Additionally, we also reformulate the inhomogeneous part of the RTE, again using the Magnus expansion, and introducing the new concept of inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent, general, and non-local formal solution to the RTE that is furthermore efficient and separates integration from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and computationally, leading to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and potential applications such as accelerating NLTE calculations. With minor adjustments, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz / Poincare algebra in special relativity and electromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Magnetogram-matching Biot-Savart Law and Decomposition of Vector Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a magnetogram-matching Biot-Savart law (BSL) from planar to spherical geometry. For a given coronal current density $\bf{J}$, this law determines the magnetic field $\tilde{\bf B}$ whose radial component vanishes at the surface. The superposition of $\tilde{\bf B}$ with a potential field defined by a given surface radial field, $B_r$, provides the entire configuration where $B_r$ remains unchanged by the currents. Using this approach, we (1) upgrade our regularized BSLs for constructing coronal magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) and (2) propose a new method for decomposing a measured photospheric magnetic field as ${\bf B} = {\bf B}_{\rm{pot}} + {\bf B}_T + {\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$, where the potential, ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$, toroidal, ${\bf B}_T$, and poloidal, ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$, fields are determined by $B_r$, $J_r$, and the surface divergence of ${\bf B} - {\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$, respectively, all derived from magnetic data. Our ${\bf B}_T$ is identical to the one in the alternative Gaussian decomposition by Schuck et al. (2022), while ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ are different from their poloidal fields ${\bf B}_{\rm{P}&lt;}$ and ${\bf B}_{\rm{P}&gt;}$, which are $potential$ in the infinitesimal proximity to the upper and lower side of the surface, respectively. In contrast, our ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ has no such constraints and, as ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_T$, refers to the $same$ upper side of the surface. In spite of these differences, for a continuous $\bf{J}$-distribution across the surface, ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ are linear combinations of ${\bf B}_{\rm{P}&lt;}$ and ${\bf B}_{\rm{P}&gt;}$. We demonstrate that, similar to the Gaussian method, our decomposition allows one to identify the footprints and projected surface-location of MFRs in the solar corona, as well as the direction and connectivity of their currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first characterization of the statistical relationship between a large sample of novae in M31 and their progenitor stellar populations in the form of a delay time distribution. To this end, we leverage the spatially resolved stellar age distribution of the M31 disk derived from deep HST photometry by the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey and a large catalog of novae in M31. Our delay time distribution has two statistically significant detections: one population of nova progenitors, ages between 2 and 3.2 Gyr, with an unnormalized rate of ($3.7^{+6.8}_{-3.5} \pm 2.1) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$, and another of ages between 7.9 Gyr and the age of the Universe with ($4.8^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \pm 0.2) \cdot 10^{-9}$ events / $M_{\odot}$ (uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively). Together with the upper limits we derive at other time bins, these detections are consistent with either a constant production efficiency or a higher production efficiency of novae at earlier delay times.</description>

      <title>On field line slippage rates in the solar corona</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is one of the fundamental dynamical processes in the solar corona. The method of studying reconnection in active region-scale magnetic fields generally depends on non-local methods (i.e. requiring information across the magnetic field under study) of magnetic topology, such as separatrix skeletons and quasi-separatrix layers. The theory of General Magnetic Reconnection is also non-local, in that its measure of the reconnection rate depends on determining the maxima of integrals along field lines. In this work, we complement the above approaches by introducing a local description of magnetic reconnection, that is one in which information about reconnection at a particular location depends only on quantities at that location. This description connects the concept of the field line slippage rate, relative to ideal motion, to the underlying local geometry of the magnetic field characterized in terms of the Lorentz force and field-aligned current density. It is argued that the dominant non-ideal term for the solar corona, discussed in relation to this new description, is mathematically equivalent to the anomalous resistivity employed by many magnetohrdrodynamic simulations. However, the general application of this new approach is adaptable to the inclusion of other non-ideal terms, which may arise from turbulence modelling or the inclusion of a generalized Ohm's law. The approach is illustrated with two examples of coronal magnetic fields related to flux ropes: an analytical model and a nonlinear force-free extrapolation. In terms of the latter, the slippage rate corresponds to the reconnection which would happen if the given (static) force-free equilibrium were the instantaneous form of the magnetic field governed by an Ohm's law with non-ideal terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21978v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and filter-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and filter-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>

      <title>A link between rocky exoplanet composition and stellar age</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interior compositions are key for our understanding of Earth-like exoplanets. The composition of the core can influence the presence of a magnetic dynamo and the strength of gravity on the planetary surface, both of which heavily impact thermal and possible biological processes and thus the habitability for life and its evolution on the planet. However, detailed measurements of the planetary interiors are extremely challenging for small exoplanets, and existing data suggest a wide diversity in planet compositions. Hitherto, only certain photospheric chemical abundances of the host stars have been considered as tracers to explain the diversity of exoplanet compositions. Here we present a homogeneous analysis of stars hosting rocky exoplanets, with ages between 2 and 14 Gyr, revealing a correlation between rocky exoplanet compositions and the ages of the planetary systems. Denser rocky planets are found around younger stars. This suggests that the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets can be linked to the ages of their host stars. We interpret this to be a result of chemical evolution of stars in the Milky Way, which modifies the material out of which stars and planets form. The results imply that rocky planets which form today, at similar galactocentric radii, may have different formation conditions, and thus different properties than planets which formed several billion years ago, such as the Earth.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Milky Way with Gaia Bp/Rp spectra I: Systematic flux corrections and atmospheric parameters for 68 million stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia Bp/Rp spectra for over two hundred million stars have great potential for mapping metallicity across the Milky Way. We aim to construct an alternative catalog of atmospheric parameters from Gaia Bp/Rp spectra by fitting them with synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres, and provide corrections to the Bp/Rp fluxes according to stellar colors, magnitudes, and extinction. We use GaiaXPy to obtain calibrated spectra and apply FERRE to match the corrected Bp/Rp spectra with models and infer atmospheric parameters. We train a neural network using stars in APOGEE to predict flux corrections as a function of wavelength for each target. Based on the comparison with APOGEE parameters, we conclude that our estimated parameters have systematic errors and uncertainties in $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [M/H] about $-38 \pm 167$ K, $0.05 \pm 0.40$ dex, and $-0.12 \pm 0.19$ dex, respectively, for stars in the range $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K. The corrected Bp/Rp spectra show better agreement with both models and Hubble Space Telescope CALSPEC data. Our correction increases the precision of the relative spectrophotometry of the Bp/Rp data from $3.2\% - 3.7\%$ to $1.2\% - 2.4\%$. Finally, we have built a catalog of atmospheric parameters for stars within $4000 \le T_{\mathrm{eff}} \le 7000$ K, comprising $68,394,431$ sources, along with a subset of $124,188$ stars with $\mathrm{[M/H]} \le -2.5$. Our results confirm that the Gaia Bp/Rp flux calibrated spectra show systematic patterns as a function of wavelength that are tightly related to colors, magnitudes, and extinction. Our optimization algorithm can give us accurate atmospheric parameters of stars with a clear and direct link to models of stellar atmospheres, and can be used to efficiently search for extremely metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>Precursor Activity Preceding Interacting Supernovae I: Bridging the Gap with SN 2022mop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, an increasing number of transients have shown luminous activity at their explosion sites weeks to years before an interacting supernova (SN) is observed. For some objects, this pre-SN activity is typically linked to large-scale mass-loss events preceding core collapse, yet its triggering mechanism and the underlying explosion process remain uncertain. We present SN 2022mop, which was initially observed in August 2022, exhibiting nebular emission, including [O I], Mg I], and [Ca II], resembling the late-time (~200 days post-explosion) spectrum of a stripped-envelope SN (SESN) from a progenitor with M[ZAMS] &lt; 18 Msun. SN 2022mop shows strong (~ 1 mag) repeating undulations in its light curve, suggesting late-time interaction. In mid-2024, the transient re-brightened for several months before a Type IIn SN (r[peak] = -18.2 mag) was observed in December 2024, closely resembling the evolution of SN 2009ip. By triangulating both transients using Pan-STARRS images, we determine that both transients are coincident within approximately 3 parsecs. Given the environment, the chance alignment of two isolated SNe is unlikely. We propose a merger-burst scenario: a compact object formed in 2022, is kicked into an eccentric orbit, interacts with its hydrogen-rich companion over subsequent months, and ultimately merges, triggering a Type IIn SN-like transient.</description>
