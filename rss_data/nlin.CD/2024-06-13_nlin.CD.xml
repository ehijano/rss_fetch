      <title>Pathways to hyperchaos in a three-dimensional quadratic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with various routes to hyperchaos with all three positive Lyapunov exponents in a three-dimensional quadratic map. The map under consideration displays strong hyperchaoticity in the sense that in a wider range of parameter space the system showcase three positive Lyapunov exponents. It is shown that the saddle periodic orbits eventually become repellers at this hyperchaotic regime. By computing the distance of the repellers to the attractors as a function of parameters, it is shown that the hyperchaotic attractors absorb the repelling periodic orbits. First we discuss a route from stable fixed point undergoing period-doubling bifurcations to chaos and then hyperchaos, and role of saddle periodic orbits. We then illustrate a route from doubling bifurcation of quasiperiodic closed invariant curves to hyperchaotic attractors. Finally, presence of weak hyperchaotic flow like attractors are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploring Geometrical Properties of Chaotic Systems Through an Analysis of the Rulkov Neuron Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While extensive research has been conducted on chaos emerging from a dynamical system's temporal dynamics, the research documented in this paper examines extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in discrete-time dynamical systems from a geometrical perspective. The heart of this paper focuses on two simple neuron maps developed by Nikolai F. Rulkov in the early 2000s and the complex geometrical structures that emerge from them. Beginning with a conversational introduction to the geometry of chaos, this paper integrates mathematics, physics, neurobiology, computational modeling, and electrochemistry to present original research that provides a novel perspective on how types of geometrical sensitivity to initial conditions appear in discrete-time neuron systems.
  This paper was developed in the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Quantum Lab as part of a senior research project.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the quantum distinction of regular and chaotic classical dynamics in dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grobe-Haake-Sommers (GHS) conjecture generalizes the Bohigas-Giannoni-Schmit conjecture to dissipative systems, connecting classically chaotic systems with quantum spectra that exhibit level repulsion as predicted by Ginibre ensembles. Here, we show that the GHS conjecture does not hold for the open Dicke model, which is a spin-boson model of experimental interest. Surprisingly, where the open quantum model shows Ginibre level statistics, we do not always find evidence of chaotic structures in the classical limit. This result challenges the universality of the GHS conjecture and raises the question of what is the source of spectral correlations in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Scale Laws for Colors and Patterns in Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution of colors and patterns in images is observed through cascades that adjust spatial resolution and dynamics. Cascades of colors reveal the emergent universal property that Fully Colored Images (FCIs) of natural scenes adhere to the debated continuous linear log-scale law (slope $-2.00 \pm 0.01$) (L1). Cascades of discrete $2 \times 2$ patterns are derived from pixel squares reductions onto the seven unlabeled rotation-free textures (0000, 0001, 0011, 0012, 0101, 0102, 0123). They exhibit an unparalleled universal entropy maximum of $1.74 \pm 0.013$ at some dynamics regardless of spatial scale (L2). Patterns also adhere to the Integral Fluctuation Theorem ($1.00 \pm 0.01$) (L3), pivotal in studies of chaotic systems. Images with fewer colors exhibit quadratic shift and bias from L1 and L3 but adhere to L2. Randomized Hilbert fractals FCIs better match the laws than basic-to-AI-based simulations. Those results are of interest in Neural Networks, out of equilibrium physics and spectral imagery.</description>

      <title>A conceptual predator-prey model with super-long transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, including linear analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply. Additionally, our results suggest that longer lifetimes in ecosystems might come at the expense of reduced populations due to limited resources.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling and the growth of errors in noisy tomography -- a quantum signature of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11221v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does quantum chaos lead to rapid scrambling of information as well as errors across a system when one introduces perturbations in the dynamics? What are its consequences for the reliability of quantum simulations and quantum information processing? We employ continuous measurement quantum tomography as a paradigm to study these questions. The measurement record is generated as a sequence of expectation values of a Hermitian observable evolving under repeated application of the Floquet map of the quantum kicked top. Interestingly, we find that the reconstruction fidelity initially increases regardless of the degree of chaos or the strength of perturbations in the dynamics. For random states, when the measurement record is obtained from a random initial observable, the subsequent drop in the fidelity obtained is inversely correlated to the degree of chaos in the dynamics. More importantly, this also gives us an operational interpretation of Loschmidt echo for operators by connecting it to the performance of quantum tomography. We define a quantity to capture the scrambling of errors, an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) between two operators under perturbed and unperturbed system dynamics that serves as a signature of chaos and quantifies the spread of errors. Our results demonstrate not only a fundamental link between Loschmidt echo and scrambling of errors, as captured by OTOCs, but that such a link can have operational consequences in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Ergodic and mixing quantum channels: From two-qubit to many-body quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of classical ergodic theory has had a significant impact in the areas of mathematics, physics, and, in general, applied sciences. The quantum ergodic theory of Hamiltonian dynamics has its motivations to understand thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Quantum channel, a completely positive trace-preserving map, represents a most general representation of quantum dynamics and is an essential aspect of quantum information theory and quantum computation. In this work, we study the ergodic theory of quantum channels by characterizing different levels of ergodic hierarchy from integrable to mixing. The quantum channels on single systems are constructed from the unitary operators acting on bipartite states and tracing out the environment. The interaction strength of these unitary operators measured in terms of operator entanglement provides sufficient conditions for the channel to be mixing. By using block diagonal unitary operators, we construct a set of non-ergodic channels. By using canonical form of two-qubit unitary operator, we analytically construct the channels on single qubit ranging from integrable to mixing. Moreover, we also study interacting many-body quantum systems that include the famous Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that they display mixing within the framework of the quantum channel.</description>
