      <description>arXiv:2404.02908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bibliographic review is a fundamental phase in a research project, and it must guarantee that the most relevant information in the field of study is obtained. Our main objective was to know the works related to the Internet of medical things, from now on (IoMT). We analyzed a total of 535 articles searched in association for Computing Machinery in Adelante ACM, Web of Science and Scopus the search domain was IoMT, we established 3 parameters, (problematic, artifact and artifact evaluation), this according to the Research of Design Science in Adelante DSR, is a research approach for the construction of artifacts to provide a useful solution to a problem in each domain. The equation (Internet of things AND mesh) resulted in 535, (Internet of things AND medicine) a total of 417 and finally (Internet of medical things AND mesh) with 8, this means that there is a lot to investigate in this research domain. The advantages identified in this type of topology is to carry messages from one node to another by different paths, there can be absolutely no interruption in communications, each server has its own communications with all other servers. Health and IT issues have been drastically influenced by the large data from IoMT devices. In this paper, we conducted a review of the scientific literature and mapped research trends on the IoMT paradigm in the health domain. Finally, this paper expands on the literature, and the findings of this study can serve as a basis for future studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Opportunistic Routing for Remote Sea Emergencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Opportunistic Routing Protocols in the context of remote sea emergency scenarios, using the MH370 plane crash as a case study (OppNetMH370). We studied the likelihood of successful transmissions of emergency messages to response services where communication methods are inadequate in remote sea areas. The study focuses on two opportunistic routing protocols, where their performances are evaluated based on key metrics including average latency and delivery probability. Our study reveals the challenges associated with the current communication technology in remote areas and proposes potential enhancements for future simulations. The findings contribute to understanding the limitations of existing communication strategies in remote sea areas and offers insights on the future development and improvements to the routing protocols.</description>

      <title>When Digital Twin Meets Generative AI: Intelligent Closed-Loop Network Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) and digital twin (DT) are advanced data processing and virtualization technologies to revolutionize communication networks. Thanks to the powerful data processing capabilities of GAI, integrating it into DT is a potential approach to construct an intelligent holistic virtualized network for better network management performance. To this end, we propose a GAI-driven DT (GDT) network architecture to enable intelligent closed-loop network management. In the architecture, various GAI models can empower DT status emulation, feature abstraction, and network decision-making. The interaction between GAI-based and model-based data processing can facilitate intelligent external and internal closed-loop network management. To further enhance network management performance, three potential approaches are proposed, i.e., model light-weighting, adaptive model selection, and data-model-driven network management. We present a case study pertaining to data-model-driven network management for the GDT network, followed by some open research issues.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Vehicle Networks for More Reliable Truck Tracking in Challenged High Mountain Roads, Tunnels and Bridges Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of online shopping has challenged the existing express tracking. How to provide customers with reliable and stable express tracking has become one of the important issues that express companies need to solve now. The current stage of courier tracking is not ideal in challenging environments such as mountain roads, tunnels and city centres. Therefore, the project aims to overcome the challenging environment and achieve stable express tracking, and proposes the Ya'an scenario and conducted multiple experiments. We show that opportunistic DTN-aware protocols are feasible solution for trucks to maintain stable communication in challenging environments, and nodes maintain extremely high message delivery rates and average delays that can maintain communication.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Mixture of Experts and Generative Artificial Intelligence in Mobile Edge Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the digital transformation era, Metaverse offers a fusion of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and web technologies to create immersive digital experiences. However, the evolution of the Metaverse is slowed down by the challenges of content creation, scalability, and dynamic user interaction. Our study investigates an integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) for mobile edge computing to revolutionize content creation and interaction in the Metaverse. Specifically, we harness an MoE model's ability to efficiently manage complex data and complex tasks by dynamically selecting the most relevant experts running various sub-models to enhance the capabilities of GAI. We then present a novel framework that improves video content generation quality and consistency, and demonstrate its application through case studies. Our findings underscore the efficacy of MoE and GAI integration to redefine virtual experiences by offering a scalable, efficient pathway to harvest the Metaverse's full potential.</description>

      <title>Traffic Divergence Theory: An Analysis Formalism for Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic dynamics is universally crucial in analyzing and designing almost any network. This article introduces a novel theoretical approach to analyzing network traffic dynamics. This theory's machinery is based on the notion of traffic divergence, which captures the flow (im)balance of network nodes and links. It features various analytical probes to investigate both spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. In particular, the maximal traffic distribution in a network can be characterized by spatial traffic divergence rate, which reveals the relative difference among node traffic divergence. To illustrate the usefulness, we apply the theory to two network-driven problems: throughput estimation of data center networks and power-optimized communication planning for robot networks, and show the merits of the proposed theory through simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning for Wireless Networks: A Demonstration with Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving collaborative approach for training models in wireless networks, with channel estimation emerging as a promising application. Despite extensive studies on FL-empowered channel estimation, the security concerns associated with FL require meticulous attention. In a scenario where small base stations (SBSs) serve as local models trained on cached data, and a macro base station (MBS) functions as the global model setting, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability of FL, launching attacks with various adversarial attacks or deployment tactics. In this paper, we analyze such vulnerabilities, corresponding solutions were brought forth, and validated through simulation.</description>

      <title>A Learning-Based Caching Mechanism for Edge Content Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of 5G networks and the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are increasingly extending into the network edge. This shift introduces unique challenges, particularly due to the limited cache storage and the diverse request patterns at the edge. These edge environments can host traffic classes characterized by varied object-size distributions and object-access patterns. Such complexity makes it difficult for traditional caching strategies, which often rely on metrics like request frequency or time intervals, to be effective. Despite these complexities, the optimization of edge caching is crucial. Improved byte hit rates at the edge not only alleviate the load on the network backbone but also minimize operational costs and expedite content delivery to end-users.
  In this paper, we introduce HR-Cache, a comprehensive learning-based caching framework grounded in the principles of Hazard Rate (HR) ordering, a rule originally formulated to compute an upper bound on cache performance. HR-Cache leverages this rule to guide future object eviction decisions. It employs a lightweight machine learning model to learn from caching decisions made based on HR ordering, subsequently predicting the "cache-friendliness" of incoming requests. Objects deemed "cache-averse" are placed into cache as priority candidates for eviction. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HR-Cache not only consistently enhances byte hit rates compared to existing state-of-the-art methods but also achieves this with minimal prediction overhead.
  Our experimental results, using three real-world traces and one synthetic trace, indicate that HR-Cache consistently achieves 2.2-14.6% greater WAN traffic savings than LRU. It outperforms not only heuristic caching strategies but also the state-of-the-art learning-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Mobile Networks: A Decision Model Of Jockeying in Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Use-case-specific network slicing in decentralized multi-tenancy cloud environments is a promising approach to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of resources in next-generation communication networks. Our findings associate different slice profiles to queues in a multi-server setting, such that tenants continuously assess their preferences and make rational decisions to minimize the queuing delay.
  Deviated from classical approaches that statistically model the jockeying phenomena in queuing systems, our work pioneers to setup a behavioral model of jockeying impatient tenants. This will serve as a basis for decentralized management of multi-queue systems, where the decision to jockey is individually made by each tenant upon its up-to-date assessment of expected waiting time. Additionally, we carry out numerical simulations to empirically unravel the parametric dependencies of the tenants' jockeying behavior.</description>

      <title>Study of Workload Interference with Intelligent Routing on Dragonfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dragonfly interconnect is a crucial network technology for supercomputers. To support exascale systems, network resources are shared such that links and routers are not dedicated to any node pair. While link utilization is increased, workload performance is often offset by network contention. Recently, intelligent routing built on reinforcement learning demonstrates higher network throughput with lower packet latency. However, its effectiveness in reducing workload interference is unknown. In this work, we present extensive network simulations to study multi-workload contention under different routing mechanisms, intelligent routing and adaptive routing, on a large-scale Dragonfly system. We develop an enhanced network simulation toolkit, along with a suite of workloads with distinctive communication patterns. We also present two metrics to characterize application communication intensity. Our analysis focuses on examining how different workloads interfere with each other under different routing mechanisms by inspecting both application-level and network-level metrics. Several key insights are made from the analysis.</description>

      <title>Q-adaptive: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Based Routing on Dragonfly Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-radix interconnects such as Dragonfly and its variants rely on adaptive routing to balance network traffic for optimum performance. Ideally, adaptive routing attempts to forward packets between minimal and non-minimal paths with the least congestion. In practice, current adaptive routing algorithms estimate routing path congestion based on local information such as output queue occupancy. Using local information to estimate global path congestion is inevitably inaccurate because a router has no precise knowledge of link states a few hops away. This inaccuracy could lead to interconnect congestion. In this study, we present Q-adaptive routing, a multi-agent reinforcement learning routing scheme for Dragonfly systems. Q-adaptive routing enables routers to learn to route autonomously by leveraging advanced reinforcement learning technology. The proposed Q-adaptive routing is highly scalable thanks to its fully distributed nature without using any shared information between routers. Furthermore, a new two-level Q-table is designed for Q-adaptive to make it computational lightly and saves 50% of router memory usage compared with the previous Q-routing. We implement the proposed Q-adaptive routing in SST/Merlin simulator. Our evaluation results show that Q-adaptive routing achieves up to 10.5% system throughput improvement and 5.2x average packet latency reduction compared with adaptive routing algorithms. Remarkably, Q-adaptive can even outperform the optimal VALn non-minimal routing under the ADV+1 adversarial traffic pattern with up to 3% system throughput improvement and 75% average packet latency reduction.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Evasion Attacks Practicality in Networks: Testing the Impact of Dynamic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has become ubiquitous, and its deployment in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) is inevitable due to its automated nature and high accuracy compared to traditional models in processing and classifying large volumes of data. However, ML has been found to have several flaws, most importantly, adversarial attacks, which aim to trick ML models into producing faulty predictions. While most adversarial attack research focuses on computer vision datasets, recent studies have explored the suitability of these attacks against ML-based network security entities, especially NIDS, due to the wide difference between different domains regarding the generation of adversarial attacks.
  To further explore the practicality of adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS in-depth, this paper presents three distinct contributions: identifying numerous practicality issues for evasion adversarial attacks on ML-NIDS using an attack tree threat model, introducing a taxonomy of practicality issues associated with adversarial attacks against ML-based NIDS, and investigating how the dynamicity of some real-world ML models affects adversarial attacks against NIDS. Our experiments indicate that continuous re-training, even without adversarial training, can reduce the effectiveness of adversarial attacks. While adversarial attacks can compromise ML-based NIDSs, our aim is to highlight the significant gap between research and real-world practicality in this domain, warranting attention.</description>
