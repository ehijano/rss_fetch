      <title>A positive meshless finite difference scheme for scalar conservation laws with adaptive artificial viscosity driven by fault detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a meshless finite difference method for multivariate scalar conservation laws that generates positive schemes satisfying a local maximum principle on irregular nodes and relies on artificial viscosity for shock capturing. Coupling two different numerical differentiation formulas and adaptive selection of the sets of influence allows to meet a local CFL condition without any a priori time step restriction. Artificial viscosity term is chosen in an adaptive way by applying it only in the vicinity of the sharp features of the solution identified by an algorithm for fault detection on scattered data. Numerical tests demonstrate a robust performance of the method on irregular nodes and advantages of adaptive artificial viscosity. The accuracy of the obtained solutions is comparable to that for standard monotone methods available only on Cartesian grids.</description>

      <title>A Fully Parallelizable Loosely Coupled Scheme for Fluid-Poroelastic Structure Interaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fluid-poroelastic structure interaction problem in a moving domain, governed by Navier-Stokes-Biot (NSBiot) system. First, we propose a fully parallelizable, loosely coupled scheme to solve the coupled system. At each time step, the solution from the previous time step is used to approximate the coupling conditions at the interface, allowing the original coupled problem to be fully decoupled into seperate fluid and structure subproblems, which are solved in parallel. Since our approach utilizes a loosely coupled scheme, no sub-iterations are required at each time step. Next, we conduct the energy estimates of this splitting method for the linearized problem (Stokes-Biot system), which demonstrates that the scheme is unconditionally stable without any restriction of the time step size from the physical parameters. Furthermore, we illustrate the first-order accuracy in time through two benchmark problems. Finally, to demonstrate that the proposed method maintains its excellent stability properties also for the nonlinear NSBiot system, we present numerical results for both $2D$ and $3D$ NSBiot problems related to real-world physical applications.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional large deformation frictional contact treatment using varying-order NURBS discretization in IGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a varying-order (VO) NURBS discretization method to enhance the performance of the IGA technique for three-dimensional large deformation frictional contact problems. Based on the promising results obtained with the previous work on the 2D isogeometric contact analysis, the present work extends the capability of the method for tri-variate NURBS discretization. The proposed method enables independent employment of the user-defined higher-order NURBS for the discretization of the contact surface and the minimum order of NURBS for the remaining solid volume. Such a method provides the possibility to refine a NURBS solid with the controllable order elevation-based approach while preserving its volume parametrization at a fixed mesh. The advantages of the method are twofold. First, the higher-order NURBS for the evaluation of contact integral enhances the accuracy of the contact responses at a fixed mesh, hence fully exploiting the advantage of higher-order NURBS specifically for contact computations. Second, the minimum order of NURBS for the computations in the remaining volume considerably reduces the computational cost associated with the uniform order NURBS-based isogeometric contact analyses.
  The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using various contact problems with or without considering friction between deformable solids. The results with the standard uniform order of NURBS-based discretization are also included to provide a comparative assessment. We show that to attain similar accuracy results, the VO NURBS discretization uses a much coarser mesh resolution than the standard NURBS-based discretization, leading to a major gain in computational efficiency for isogeometric contact analysis. The convergence study demonstrates the consistent performance of the method for efficient IGA of three-dimensional (3D) frictional contact problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal preconditioners for nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz systems with application to solving non-local evolutionary partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preconditioning for multilevel Toeplitz systems has long been a focal point of research in numerical linear algebra. In this work, we develop a novel preconditioning method for a class of nonsymmetric multilevel Toeplitz systems, which includes the all-at-once systems that arise from evolutionary partial differential equations. These systems have recently garnered considerable attention in the literature. To further illustrate our proposed preconditioning strategy, we specifically consider the application of solving a wide range of non-local, time-dependent partial differential equations in a parallel-in-time manner. For these equations, we propose a symmetric positive definite multilevel Tau preconditioner that is not only efficient to implement but can also be adapted as an optimal preconditioner. In this context, the proposed preconditioner is optimal in the sense that it enables mesh-independent convergence when using the preconditioned generalized minimal residual method. Numerical examples are provided to critically analyze the results and underscore the effectiveness of our preconditioning strategy.</description>

      <title>Finite-Difference Approximations and Local Algorithm for the Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-difference approximations of both Poisson and Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) electrostatic energy functionals for periodic structures constrained by Gauss' law and a class of local algorithms for minimizing the finite-difference discretization of such functionals. The variable of Poisson energy is the vector field of electric displacement and that for the PB energy consists of an electric displacement and ionic concentrations. The displacement is discretized at midpoints of edges of grid boxes while the concentrations are discretize at grid points. The local algorithm is an iteration over all the grid boxes that locally minimizes the energy on each grid box, keeping Gauss' law satisfied. We prove that the energy functionals admit unique minimizers that are solutions to the corresponding Poisson's and charge-conserved PB equation, respectively. Local equilibrium conditions are identified to characterize the finite-difference minimizers of the discretized energy functionals. These conditions are the curl free for the Poisson case and the discrete Boltzmann distributions for the PB case, respectively. Next, we obtain the uniform bound with respect to the grid size h and O(h2)-error estimates in maximum norm for the finite-difference minimizers. The local algorithms are detailed, and a new local algorithm with shift is proposed to treat the general case of a variable coefficient for the Poisson energy. We prove the convergence of all these local algorithms, using the characterization of the finite-difference minimizers. Finally, we present numerical tests to demonstrate the results of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Bound Preserving Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction Method for Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff flux reconstruction (LWFR) schemes have high order of accuracy in both space and time despite having a single internal time step. Here, we design a Jacobian-free LWFR type scheme to solve the special relativistic hydrodynamics equations. We then blend the scheme with a first-order finite volume scheme to control the oscillations near discontinuities. We also use a scaling limiter to preserve the physical admissibility of the solution after ensuring the scheme is admissible in means. A particular focus is given to designing a discontinuity indicator model to detect the local non-smoothness in the solution of the highly non-linear relativistic hydrodynamics equations. Finally, we present the numerical results of a wide range of test cases with fourth and fifth-order schemes to show their robustness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>High-precision randomized iterative methods for the random feature method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on solving large-scale, ill-conditioned, and overdetermined sparse least squares problems that arise from numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), mainly from the random feature method. To address these difficulties, we introduce (1) a count sketch technique to sketch the original matrix to a smaller matrix; (2) a QR factorization or a singular value decomposition for the smaller matrix to obtain the preconditioner, which is multiplied to the original matrix from the right-hand side; (3) least squares iterative solvers to solve the preconditioned least squares system. Therefore, the methods we develop are termed CSQRP-LSQR and CSSVDP-LSQR. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the preconditioned problem holds a condition number whose upper bound is independent of the condition number of the original matrix, and provide error estimates for both methods. Ample numerical experiments, including least squares problems arising from two-dimensional and three-dimensional PDEs and the Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, are conducted. Both methods are comparable to or even better than direct methods in accuracy and are computationally more efficient for large-scale problems. This opens up the applicability of the random feature method for PDEs over complicated geometries with high-complexity solutions.</description>

      <title>A discrete trace theory for non-conforming polytopal hybrid discretisation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we develop a discrete trace theory that spans non-conforming hybrid discretization methods and holds on polytopal meshes. A notion of a discrete trace seminorm is defined, and trace and lifting results with respect to a discrete $H^1$-seminorm on the hybrid fully discrete space are proven. Building on these results we also prove a truncation estimate for piecewise polynomials in the discrete trace seminorm. Finally, we conduct two numerical tests in which we compute the proposed discrete operators and investigate their spectrum to verify the theoretical analysis. The development of this theory is motivated by the design and analysis of preconditioners for hybrid methods, e.g., of substructuring domain decomposition type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main focus of this paper is to analyze the behavior of a numerical solution of the Timoshenko system coupled with Thermoelasticity and incorporating second sound effects. In order to address this target, we employ the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework to derive an approximate solution for the system. Our investigation delves into the extent to which this approximate solution can accurately capture the asymptotic behavior of the discrete energy, contingent upon the stability number $\chi$. Interestingly, the PINNs overcome the major difficulties encountered while using the standard numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Preserving positivity of Gauss-Newton Hessian through random sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerically the reconstructability of unknown parameters in inverse problems heavily relies on the chosen data. Therefore, it is crucial to design an experiment that yields data that is sensitive to the parameters. We approach this problem from the perspective of a least squares optimization, and examine the positivity of the Gauss-Newton Hessian at the global minimum point of the objective function. We propose a general framework that provides an efficient down-sampling strategy that can select data that preserves the strict positivity of the Hessian. Matrix sketching techniques from randomized linear algebra is heavily leaned on to achieve this goal. The method requires drawing samples from a certain distribution, and gradient free sampling methods are integrated to execute the data selection. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in selecting sensor locations for Schr\"odinger potential reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The lowest-order Neural Approximated Virtual Element Method on polygonal elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lowest-order Neural Approximated Virtual Element Method on polygonal elements is proposed here. This method employs a neural network to locally approximate the Virtual Element basis functions, thereby eliminating issues concerning stabilization and projection operators, which are the key components of the standard Virtual Element Method. We propose different training strategies for the neural network training, each correlated by the theoretical justification and with a different level of accuracy. Several numerical experiments are proposed to validate our procedure on general polygonal meshes and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method across different problem formulations, particularly in cases where the heavy usage of projection and stabilization terms may represent challenges for the standard version of the method. Particular attention is reserved to triangular meshes with hanging nodes which assume a central role in many virtual element applications.</description>

      <title>Multiscale method for image denoising using nonlinear diffusion process: local denoising and spectral multiscale basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider image denoising using a nonlinear diffusion process, where we solve unsteady partial differential equations with nonlinear coefficients. The noised image is given as an initial condition, and nonlinear coefficients are used to preserve the main image features. In this paper, we present a multiscale method for the resulting nonlinear parabolic equation in order to construct an efficient solver. To both filter out noise and preserve essential image features during the denoising process, we utilize a time-dependent nonlinear diffusion model known as Perona-Malik. Here, the noised image is fed as an initial condition and the denoised image is stimulated with given parameters. We numerically implement this model by constructing a discrete system for a given image resolution using a finite volume method and employing an implicit time approximation scheme to avoid time-step restriction. However, the resulting discrete system size is proportional to the number of pixels which leads to computationally expensive numerical algorithms for high-resolution images. In order to reduce the size of the system and construct efficient computational algorithms, we construct a coarse-resolution representation of the system using the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). We incorporate local noise reduction in the coarsening process to construct an efficient algorithm with fewer denoising iterations. We propose a computational approach with two main ingredients: (1) performing local image denoising in each local domain of basis support; and (2) constructing spectral multiscale basis functions to construct a coarse resolution representation by a Galerkin coupling. We present numerical results for several test images to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multiscale approach with local denoising and local spectral representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximation of problems in linear elasticity having small shear modulus in a thin region is considered. Problems of this type arise when modeling ground motion due to earthquakes where rupture occurs in a thin fault. It is shown that, under appropriate scaling, solutions of these problems can be approximated by solutions of a limit problem where the fault region is represented by a surface. In a numerical context this eliminates the need to resolve the large deformations in the fault; a numerical example is presented to illustrate efficacy of this strategy.</description>

      <title>Second order divergence constraint preserving entropy stable finite difference schemes for ideal two-fluid plasma flow equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-fluid plasma flow equations describe the flow of ions and electrons with different densities, velocities, and pressures. We consider the ideal plasma flow i.e. we ignore viscous, resistive, and collision effects. The resulting system of equations has flux consisting of three independent components, one for ions, one for electrons, and a linear Maxwell's equation flux for the electromagnetic fields. The coupling of these components is via source terms. In this article, we present {conservative} second-order finite difference schemes that ensure the consistent evolution of the divergence constraints on the electric and magnetic fields. The key idea is to design a numerical solver for Maxwell's equations using the multidimensional Riemann solver at the vertices, ensuring discrete divergence constraints; for the fluid parts, we use an entropy-stable discretization. The proposed schemes are co-located, second-order accurate, entropy stable, and ensure divergence-free evolution of the magnetic field. We use explicit and IMplicit-EXplicit (IMEX) schemes for time discretizations. To demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and divergence constraint-preserving ability of the proposed schemes, we present several test cases in one and two dimensions. We also compare the numerical results with those obtained from schemes with no divergence cleaning and those employing perfectly hyperbolic Maxwell (PHM) equations-based divergence cleaning methods for Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Operator-difference approximations on two-dimensional merged Voronoi-Delaunay grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating boundary value problems for multidimensional partial derivative equations in terms of invariant operators of vector (tensor) analysis is convenient. Computational algorithms for approximate solutions are based on constructing grid analogs of vector analysis operators. This is most easily done by dividing the computational domain into rectangular cells when the grid nodes coincide with the cell vertices or are the cell centers. Grid operators of vector analysis for irregular regions are constructed using Delaunay triangulations or Voronoi partitions. This paper uses two-dimensional merged Voronoi-Delaunay grids to represent the grid cells as orthodiagonal quadrilaterals. Consistent approximations of the gradient, divergence, and rotor operators are proposed. On their basis, operator-difference approximations for typical stationary scalar and vector problems are constructed.</description>

      <title>A new interpolated pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new pseudodifferential preconditioner for the Helmholtz equation in variable media with absorption. The pseudodifferential operator is associated with the multiplicative inverse to the symbol of the Helmholtz operator. This approach is well-suited for the intermediate and high-frequency regimes. The main novel idea for the fast evaluation of the preconditioner is to interpolate its symbol, not as a function of the (high-dimensional) phase-space variables, but as a function of the wave speed itself. Since the wave speed is a real-valued function, this approach allows us to interpolate in a univariate setting even when the original problem is posed in a multidimensional physical space. As a result, the needed number of interpolation points is small, and the interpolation coefficients can be computed using the fast Fourier transform. The overall computational complexity is log-linear with respect to the degrees of freedom as inherited from the fast Fourier transform. We present some numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of the preconditioner to solve the discrete Helmholtz equation using the GMRES iterative method. The implementation of an absorbing layer for scattering problems using a complex-valued wave speed is also developed. Limitations and possible extensions are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pressure stability in explicitly coupled simulations of poromechanics with application to CO$_2$ sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in detail the pressure stabilizing effects of the non-iterated fixed-stress splitting in poromechanical problems which are nearly undrained and incompressible. When applied in conjunction with a spatial discretization which does not satisfy the discrete inf-sup condition, namely a mixed piecewise linear - piecewise constant spatial discretization, the explicit fixed-stress scheme can have a pressure stabilizing effect in transient problems. This effect disappears, however, upon time step refinement or the attainment of steady state. The interpretation of the scheme as an Augmented Lagrangian method similar to Uzawa iteration for incompressible flow helps explain these results. Moreover, due to the slowly evolving solution within undrained seal regions, we show that the explicit fixed-stress scheme requires very large time steps to reveal its pressure stabilizing effect in examples of geologic CO$_2$ sequestration. We note that large time steps can result in large errors in drained regions, such as the aquifer or reservoir regions of these examples, and can prevent convergence of nonlinear solvers in the case of multiphase flows, which can make the explicit scheme an unreliable source of pressure stabilization. We conclude by demonstrating that pressure jump stabilization is as effective in the explicit fixed-stress setting as in the fully implicit setting for undrained problems, while maintaining the stability and convergence of the fixed-stress split for drained problems.</description>

      <title>Extended one-dimensional reduced model for blood flow within a stenotic artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an adapted one-dimensional (1D) reduced model aimed at analyzing blood flow within stenosed arteries. Differing from the prevailing 1D model \cite{Formaggia2003, Sherwin2003_2, Sherwin2003, Quarteroni2004, 10.1007/978-3-642-56288-4_10}, our approach incorporates the variable radius of the blood vessel. Our methodology begins with the non-dimensionalization of the Navier-Stokes equations for axially symmetric flow in cylindrical coordinates and then derives the extended 1D reduced model, by making additional adjustments to accommodate the effects of variable radii of the vessel along the longitudinal direction. Additionally, we propose a method to extract radial velocity information from the 1D results during post-processing, enabling the generation of two-dimensional (2D) velocity data. We validate our model by conducting numerical simulations of blood flow through stenotic arteries with varying severities, ranging from 23% to 50%. The results were compared to those from the established 1D model and a full three-dimensional (3D) simulation, highlighting the potential and importance of this model for arteries with variable radius. All the code used to generate the results presented in the paper is available at https://github.com/qcutexu/Extended-1D-AQ-system.git.</description>

      <title>Bound-preserving OEDG schemes for Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic models on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical solutions to the widely used Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic model and the adapted pressure (AP) ARZ model should satisfy the positivity of density, the minimum and maximum principles with respect to the velocity $v$ and other Riemann invariants. Many numerical schemes suffer from instabilities caused by violating these bounds, and the only existing bound-preserving (BP) numerical scheme (for ARZ model) is random, only first-order accurate, and not strictly conservative. This paper introduces arbitrarily high-order provably BP DG schemes for these two models, preserving all the aforementioned bounds except the maximum principle of $v$, which has been rigorously proven to conflict with the consistency and conservation of numerical schemes. Although the maximum principle of $v$ is not directly enforced, we find that the strictly preserved maximum principle of another Riemann invariant $w$ actually enforces an alternative upper bound on $v$. At the core of this work, analyzing and rigorously proving the BP property is a particularly nontrivial task: the Lax-Friedrichs (LF) splitting property, usually expected for hyperbolic conservation laws and employed to construct BP schemes, does not hold for these two models. To overcome this challenge, we formulate a generalized version of the LF splitting property, and prove it via the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach [Kailiang Wu and Chi-Wang Shu, SIAM Review, 65: 1031-1073, 2023]. To suppress spurious oscillations in the DG solutions, we employ the oscillation-eliminating (OE) technique, recently proposed in [Manting Peng, Zheng Sun, and Kailiang Wu, Mathematics of Computation, in press], which is based on the solution operator of a novel damping equation. Several numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and BP properties of our schemes, with applications to traffic simulations on road networks.</description>

      <title>Sticky coupling as a control variate for sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze a control variate strategy based on couplings to reduce the variance of finite difference estimators of sensitivity coefficients, called transport coefficients in the physics literature. We study the bias and variance of a sticky-coupling and a synchronous-coupling based estimator as the finite difference parameter $\eta$ goes to zero. For diffusions with elliptic additive noise, we show that when the drift is contractive outside a compact the bias of a sticky-coupling based estimator is bounded as $\eta \to 0$ and its variance behaves like $\eta^{-1}$, compared to the standard estimator whose bias and variance behave like $\eta^{-1}$ and $\eta^{-2}$, respectively. Under the stronger assumption that the drift is contractive everywhere, we additionally show that the bias and variance of the synchronous-coupling based estimator are both bounded as $\eta \to 0$. Our hypotheses include overdamped Langevin dynamics with many physically relevant non-convex potentials. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical examples, including overdamped Langevin dynamics with a highly non-convex Lennard-Jones potential to demonstrate both failure of synchronous coupling and the effectiveness of sticky coupling in the not globally contractive setting.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo integration for feedback control under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A control in feedback form is derived for linear quadratic, time-invariant optimal control problems subject to parabolic partial differential equations with coefficients depending on a countably infinite number of uncertain parameters. It is shown that the Riccati-based feedback operator depends analytically on the parameters provided that the system operator depends analytically on the parameters, as is the case, for instance, in diffusion problems when the diffusion coefficient is parameterized by a Karhunen--Lo\`eve expansion. These novel parametric regularity results allow the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to efficiently compute an a-priori chosen feedback law based on the expected value. Moreover, under moderate assumptions on the input random field, QMC methods achieve superior error rates compared to ordinary Monte Carlo methods, independently of the stochastic dimension of the problem. Indeed, our paper for the first time studies Banach-space-valued integration by higher-order QMC methods.</description>

      <title>Time-Adaptive PIROCK Method with Error Control for Multi-Fluid and Single-Fluid MHD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is a complex environment with diverse species and varying ionization states, especially in the chromosphere, where significant ionization variations occur. This region transitions from highly collisional to weakly collisional states, leading to complex plasma state transitions influenced by magnetic strengths and collisional properties. These processes introduce numerical stiffness in multi-fluid models, imposing severe timestep restrictions on standard time integration methods. New numerical methods are essential to address these computational challenges, effectively managing the diverse timescales in multi-fluid and multi-physics models. The widely used time operator splitting technique offers a straightforward approach but requires careful timestep management to avoid stability issues and errors. Despite some studies on splitting errors, their impact on solar and stellar astrophysics is often overlooked. We focus on a Multi-Fluid Multi-Species (MFMS) model, which presents significant challenges for time integration. We propose a second-order Partitioned Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (PIROCK) method that combines efficient explicit and implicit integration techniques with variable time-stepping and error control. Compared to a standard third-order explicit method and a first-order Lie splitting approach, the PIROCK method shows robust advantages in accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency. Our results reveal PIROCK's capability to solve multi-fluid problems with unprecedented efficiency. Preliminary results on chemical fractionation represent a significant step toward understanding the First-Ionization-Potential (FIP) effect in the solar atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: We consider a boundary value problem of a stationary advection equation in a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary. It is known to be well-posed in $L^p$-based function spaces for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ under the separation condition of the inflow and the outflow boundaries. In this article, we provide another sufficient condition for the well-posedness with $1 \leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming for Stochastic Optimization with Random Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider solving optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Sequential Quadratic Programming method to find both first- and second-order stationary points. Our method utilizes a random model to represent the objective function, which is constructed from stochastic observations of the objective and is designed to satisfy proper adaptive accuracy conditions with a high but fixed probability. To converge to first-order stationary points, our method computes a gradient step in each iteration defined by minimizing a quadratic approximation of the objective subject to a (relaxed) linear approximation of the problem constraints and a trust-region constraint. To converge to second-order stationary points, our method additionally computes an eigen step to explore the negative curvature of the reduced Hessian matrix, as well as a second-order correction step to address the potential Maratos effect, which arises due to the nonlinearity of the problem constraints. Such an effect may impede the method from moving away from saddle points. Both gradient and eigen step computations leverage a novel parameter-free decomposition of the step and the trust-region radius, accounting for the proportions among the feasibility residual, optimality residual, and negative curvature. We establish global almost sure first- and second-order convergence guarantees for our method, and present computational results on CUTEst problems, regression problems, and saddle-point problems to demonstrate its superiority over existing line-search-based stochastic methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying early tumour states in a Cahn-Hilliard-reaction-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of reconstructing earlier tumour configurations starting from a single spatial measurement at a later time. We describe the tumour evolution through a diffuse interface model coupling a Cahn-Hilliard-type equation for the tumour phase field to a reaction-diffusion equation for a key nutrient proportion, also accounting for chemotaxis effects. We stress that the ability to reconstruct earlier tumour states is crucial for calibrating the model used to predict the tumour dynamics and also to identify the areas where the tumour initially began to develop. However, backward-in-time inverse problems are well-known to be severely ill-posed, even for linear parabolic equations. Moreover, we also face additional challenges due to the complexity of a non-linear fourth-order parabolic system. Nonetheless, we can establish uniqueness by using logarithmic convexity methods under suitable a priori assumptions. To further address the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, we propose a Tikhonov regularisation approach that approximates the solution through a family of constrained minimisation problems. For such problems, we analytically derive the first-order necessary optimality conditions. Finally, we develop a computationally efficient numerical approximation of the optimisation problems by employing standard $C^0$-conforming first-order finite elements. We conduct numerical experiments on several pertinent test cases and observe that the proposed algorithm consistently meets expectations, delivering accurate reconstructions of the original ground truth.</description>

      <title>A Formalization of Image Vectorization by Region Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image vectorization converts raster images into vector graphics composed of regions separated by curves. Typical vectorization methods first define the regions by grouping similar colored regions via color quantization, then approximate their boundaries by Bezier curves. In that way, the raster input is converted into an SVG format parameterizing the regions' colors and the Bezier control points. This compact representation has many graphical applications thanks to its universality and resolution-independence. In this paper, we remark that image vectorization is nothing but an image segmentation, and that it can be built by fine to coarse region merging. Our analysis of the problem leads us to propose a vectorization method alternating region merging and curve smoothing. We formalize the method by alternate operations on the dual and primal graph induced from any domain partition. In that way, we address a limitation of current vectorization methods, which separate the update of regional information from curve approximation. We formalize region merging methods by associating them with various gain functionals, including the classic Beaulieu-Goldberg and Mumford-Shah functionals. More generally, we introduce and compare region merging criteria involving region number, scale, area, and internal standard deviation. We also show that the curve smoothing, implicit in all vectorization methods, can be performed by the shape-preserving affine scale space. We extend this flow to a network of curves and give a sufficient condition for the topological preservation of the segmentation. The general vectorization method that follows from this analysis shows explainable behaviors, explicitly controlled by a few intuitive parameters. It is experimentally compared to state-of-the-art software and proved to have comparable or superior fidelity and cost efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The problem of solution transfer between meshes arises frequently in computational physics, e.g. in Lagrangian methods where remeshing occurs. The interpolation process must be conservative, i.e. it must conserve physical properties, such as mass. We extend previous works -- which described the solution transfer process for straight sided unstructured meshes -- by considering high-order isoparametric meshes with curved elements. To facilitate solution transfer, we numerically integrate the product of shape functions via Green's theorem along the boundary of the intersection of two curved elements. We perform a numerical experiment and confirm the expected accuracy by transferring test fields across two families of meshes.</description>

      <title>Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation over general regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel variant of hyperinterpolation, called hard thresholding hyperinterpolation. This approximation scheme of degree $n$ leverages a hard thresholding operator to filter all hyperinterpolation coefficients, which approximate the Fourier coefficients of a continuous function by a quadrature rule with algebraic exactness $2n$. We prove that hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is the unique solution to an $\ell_0$-regularized weighted discrete least squares approximation problem. Hard thresholding hyperinterpolation is not only idempotent and commutative with hyperinterpolation, but also adheres to the Pythagorean theorem in terms of the discrete (semi) inner product. By the estimate of the reciprocal of Christoffel function, we present the upper bound of the uniform norm of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation operator. Additionally, hard thresholding hyperinterpolation possesses denoising and basis selection abilities akin to Lasso hyperinterpolation. To judge the $L_2$ errors of both hard thresholding and Lasso hyperinterpolations, we propose a criterion that integrates the regularization parameter with the product of noise coefficients and the signs of hyperinterpolation coefficients. Numerical examples on the sphere, spherical triangle and the cube demonstrate the denoising ability of hard thresholding hyperinterpolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of inexact Newton methods is studied for solving generalized equations on Riemannian manifolds by using the metric regularity property, which is also explored. Under appropriate conditions and without any additional geometric assumptions, local convergence results with linear and quadratic rates, as well as a semi-local convergence result, are obtained for the proposed method. Finally, the theory is applied to the problem of finding a singularity for the sum of two vector fields. In particular, the KKT system for the constrained Riemannian center of mass on the sphere is explored numerically.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is steered by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is called chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, it is inferred by experimental data. We deploy a PDE-constrained optimization framework to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Direction Methods Under Inconsistent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the development of the conjugate gradient (CG) method in 1952 by Hestenes and Stiefel, CG, has become an indispensable tool in computational mathematics for solving positive definite linear systems. On the other hand, the conjugate residual (CR) method, closely related CG and introduced by Stiefel in 1955 for the same settings, remains relatively less known outside the numerical linear algebra community. Since their inception, these methods -- henceforth collectively referred to as conjugate direction methods -- have been extended beyond positive definite to indefinite, albeit consistent, settings. Going one step further, in this paper, we investigate the theoretical and empirical properties of these methods under inconsistent systems. Among other things, we show that small modifications to the original algorithms allow for the pseudo-inverse solution. Furthermore, we show that CR is essentially equivalent to the minimum residual method, proposed by Paige and Saunders in 1975, in such contexts. Lastly, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to shed lights on their numerical stability (or lack thereof) and their performance for inconsistent systems. Surprisingly, we will demonstrate that, unlike CR and contrary to popular belief, CG can exhibit significant numerical instability, bordering on catastrophe in some instances.</description>

      <title>Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction on adaptive curvilinear meshes with error based time stepping for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lax-Wendroff Flux Reconstruction (LWFR) is a single-stage, high order, quadrature free method for solving hyperbolic conservation laws. This work extends the LWFR scheme to solve conservation laws on curvilinear meshes with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The scheme uses a subcell based blending limiter to perform shock capturing and exploits the same subcell structure to obtain admissibility preservation on curvilinear meshes. It is proven that the proposed extension of LWFR scheme to curvilinear grids preserves constant solution (free stream preservation) under the standard metric identities. For curvilinear meshes, linear Fourier stability analysis cannot be used to obtain an optimal CFL number. Thus, an embedded-error based time step computation method is proposed for LWFR method which reduces fine-tuning process required to select a stable CFL number using the wave speed based time step computation. The developments are tested on compressible Euler's equations, validating the blending limiter, admissibility preservation, AMR algorithm, curvilinear meshes and error based time stepping.</description>

      <title>Sampling error mitigation through spectrum smoothing in ensemble data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data assimilation, an ensemble provides a way to propagate a probability density of a system described by a nonlinear prediction model. Although a large ensemble size is required for statistical accuracy, the ensemble size is typically limited to a small number due to the computational cost of running the prediction model, which leads to a sampling error. Several methods, such as localization and inflation, exist to mitigate the sampling error, often requiring problem-dependent fine-tuning and design. This work introduces a nonintrusive sampling error mitigation method that modifies the ensemble to ensure a smooth turbulent spectrum. It turns out that the ensemble modification to satisfy the smooth spectrum leads to inhomogeneous localization and inflation, which apply varying localization and inflation levels at different locations. The efficacy of the new idea is validated through a suite of stringent test regimes of the Lorenz 96 turbulent model.</description>

      <title>Optimal balanced-norm error estimate of the LDG method for reaction-diffusion problems II: the two-dimensional case with layer-upwind flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problem posed on the unit square in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is solved numerically by a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) finite element method. Typical solutions of this class of problem exhibit boundary layers along the sides of the domain; these layers generally cause difficulties for numerical methods. Our LDG method handles the boundary layers by using a Shishkin mesh and also introducing the new concept of a ``layer-upwind flux" -- a discrete flux whose values are chosen on the fine mesh (which lies inside the boundary layers) in the direction where the layer weakens. On the coarse mesh, one can use a standard central flux. No penalty terms are needed with these fluxes, unlike many other variants of the LDG method. Our choice of discrete flux makes it feasible to derive an optimal-order error analysis in a balanced norm; this norm is stronger than the usual energy norm and is a more appropriate measure for errors in computed solutions for singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion problems. It will be proved that the LDG method is usually convergent of order $O((N^{-1}\ln N)^{k+1})$ in the balanced norm, where $N$ is the number of mesh intervals in each coordinate direction and tensor-product piecewise polynomials of degree~$k$ in each coordinate variable are used in the LDG method. This result is the first of its kind for the LDG method applied to this class of problem and is optimal for convergence on a Shishkin mesh. Its sharpness is confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Uniform Approximation of Eigenproblems of a Large-Scale Parameter-Dependent Hermitian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of the smallest eigenvalue of a large parameter-dependent Hermitian matrix over a continuum compact domain. Our approach is based on approximating the smallest eigenvalue by the one obtained by projecting the large matrix onto a suitable small subspace, a practice widely employed in the literature. The projection subspaces are constructed iteratively (to reduce the error of the approximation where it is large) with the addition of the eigenvectors of the parameter-dependent matrix at the parameter values where a surrogate error is maximal. The surrogate error is the gap between the approximation and a lower bound for the smallest eigenvalue proposed in [Sirkovic and Kressner, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 37(2), 2016]. Unlike the classical approaches, such as the successive constraint method, that maximize such surrogate errors over a discrete and finite set, we maximize the surrogate error over the continuum of all permissible parameter values globally. We put particular attention to the lower bound, which enables us to formally prove the global convergence of our framework both in finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings. In the second part, we focus on the approximation of the smallest singular value of a large parameter-dependent matrix, in case it is non-Hermitian, and propose another subspace framework to construct a small parameter-dependent non-Hermitian matrix whose smallest singular value approximates the original large-scale smallest singular value. We perform numerical experiments on synthetic examples, as well as on real examples arising from parametric PDEs. The numerical experiments show that the proposed techniques are able to drastically reduce the size of the large parameter-dependent matrix, while ensuring an approximation error for the smallest eigenvalue/singular value below the prescribed tolerance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04829v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for estimating joint probability distributions using tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). Our framework accommodates a low-dimensional, normalized and positive model of a Radon--Nikodym derivative, which we estimate from sample sizes of up to several millions, alleviating the inherent limitations of RKHS modeling. Well-defined normalized and positive conditional distributions are natural by-products to our approach. Our proposal is fast to compute and accommodates learning problems ranging from prediction to classification. Our theoretical findings are supplemented by favorable numerical results.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear boolean equation systems play an important role in a wide range of applications. Grover's algorithm is one of the best-known quantum search algorithms in solving the nonlinear boolean equation system on quantum computers. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to improve the efficiency under Grover's algorithm framework. A W-cycle circuit construction introduces a recursive idea to increase the solvable number of boolean equations given a fixed number of qubits. Then, a greedy compression technique is proposed to reduce the oracle circuit depth. Finally, a randomized Grover's algorithm randomly chooses a subset of equations to form a random oracle every iteration, which further reduces the circuit depth and the number of ancilla qubits. Numerical results on boolean quadratic equations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>PICL: Physics Informed Contrastive Learning for Partial Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16327v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have recently grown in popularity as Partial Differential Equation (PDE) surrogate models. Learning solution functionals, rather than functions, has proven to be a powerful approach to calculate fast, accurate solutions to complex PDEs. While much work has been done evaluating neural operator performance on a wide variety of surrogate modeling tasks, these works normally evaluate performance on a single equation at a time. In this work, we develop a novel contrastive pretraining framework utilizing Generalized Contrastive Loss that improves neural operator generalization across multiple governing equations simultaneously. Governing equation coefficients are used to measure ground-truth similarity between systems. A combination of physics-informed system evolution and latent-space model output are anchored to input data and used in our distance function. We find that physics-informed contrastive pretraining improves accuracy for the Fourier Neural Operator in fixed-future and autoregressive rollout tasks for the 1D and 2D Heat, Burgers', and linear advection equations.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the convergence behaviour of the classical generalized Max Product exponential sampling series in the weighted space of log-uniformly continuous and bounded functions. We derive basic convergence results for both the series and study the asymptotic convergence behaviour. Some quantitative approximation results have been obtained utilizing the notion of weighted logarithmic modulus of continuity.</description>
