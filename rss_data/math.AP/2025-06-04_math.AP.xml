      <title>Weiss monotonicity and capillary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work of the authors established the rigorous limiting behavior of minimizing capillary surfaces to minimizers of the Alt--Caffarelli functional as the capillary angle tends to zero. We prove here that in this limit, the capillary area-density converges to the Weiss energy density. We apply this to obtain angle-independent curvature estimates and regularity results for capillary minimizers.</description>

      <title>Separable motions for self-gravitating hyperelastic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of separable solutions to the equations of motion for self-gravitating hyperelastic matter, under an appropriate class of constitutive assumptions on the strain-energy function. Our framework includes both global-in-time solutions which expand and also solutions which collapse to a point in finite time. Other authors have constructed expanding solutions in similar settings, but to the best of our knowledge, the collapsing solutions we construct are completely new.</description>

      <title>Weyl formula improvement for product of Zoll manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iosevich and Wyman have proved in ~\cite{IoWy} that the remainder term in classical Weyl law can be improved from $O(\lambda^{d-1})$ to $o(\lambda^{d-1})$ in the case of product manifold by using a famous result of Duistermaat and Guillemin. They also showed that we could have polynomial improvement in the special case of Cartesian product of round spheres by reducing the problem to the study of the distribution of weighted integer lattice points. In this paper, we show that we can extend this result to the case of Cartesian product of Zoll manifolds by investigating the eigenvalue clusters of Zoll manifold and reducing the problem to the study of the distribution of weighted integer lattice points too.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Serrin-type overdetermined problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric constraints imposed on a domain by overdetermined problems for partial differential equations. Serrin's symmetry results are extended to overdetermined problems with potentially degenerate ellipticity in nonsmooth bounded domains. Furthermore, analogous symmetry results are established for ring-shaped domains. The proof relies on continuous Steiner symmetrization, along with a carefully constructed approximation argument.</description>

      <title>A priori error estimates for the $\theta$-method for the flow of nonsmooth velocity fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity fields with low regularity (below the Lipschitz threshold) naturally arise in many models from mathematical physics, such as the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and play a fundamental role in the analysis of nonlinear PDEs. The DiPerna-Lions theory ensures existence and uniqueness of the flow associated with a divergence-free velocity field with Sobolev regularity. In this paper, we establish a priori error estimates showing a logarithmic rate of convergence of numerical solutions, constructed via the $\theta$-method, towards the exact (analytic) flow for a velocity field with Sobolev regularity. In addition, we derive analogous a priori error estimates for Lagrangian solutions of the associated transport equation, exhibiting the same logarithmic rate of convergence. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, which confirm the predicted logarithmic behavior.</description>

      <title>On Stability and Instability of the De Gregorio Model Near Excited States on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Constantin-Lax-Majda (CLM) model and the De Gregorio model which is a modification of the CLM model are well-known for their ability to emulate the behavior of the 3D Euler equations, particularly their potential to develop finite-time singularities. The stability properties of the De Gregorio model on the torus near the ground state $-\sin\theta$ have been thoroughly studied. However, the stability analysis near excited states $-\sin k\theta$ with $k\ge 2$ remains challenging. This paper focuses on analyzing the stability and instability of the De Gregorio model on torus around the first excited state $-\sin 2\theta$. The linear and nonlinear instability are established for a broad class of initial data, while nonlinear stability is proved for another large class of initial data in this paper. Our analysis reveals that solution behavior to the De Gregorio model near excited states demonstrates different stability patterns depending on initial conditions. One of new ingredients in our instability analysis involves deriving a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the Fourier coefficients of solutions and examining the spectral properties of a positive definite quadratic form emerging from this ODE.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness in determining a convex polygonal source of an elastic body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the time-harmonic inverse elastic source problem of a fixed frequency for the Navier equation in two dimensions. We show that a convex polygon can be uniquely determined by a single far field measurement. Our approach relies on the corner singularity analysis of solutions to the inhomogeneous Navier equation with a source term in a sector. This paper also contributes to corner scattering theory for the Navier equation in an non-convex domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Riesz-type nonlocal energies with general interaction kernels and their discretizations related to particle systems. We prove that the discretized energies $\Gamma$-converge in the weak-$*$ topology to the Riesz functional defined over the space of probability measures. We also address the minimization problem for the discretized energies, and prove the existence of minimal configurations of particles in a very general and natural setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the existence of H\"{o}lder continuous periodic weak solutions of the 3D Boussinesq equation with thermal diffusion, which apprroximate the Onsager's critical spatial regularity and satisfy the prescribed kinetic energy. More precisely, for any smooth $e(t):[0,T]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ and $\beta\in (0, \frac{1}{3})$, there exist $v\in C^{\beta}([0,T]\times {\mathbb{T} }^3)$ and $ \theta\in C_t^{1,\frac{\beta}{2}}C_x^{2,\beta}([0,T]\times {\mathbb{T} }^3)$ which solve (\ref{e:boussinesq equation}) in the sense of distribution and satisfy \begin{align} e(t)=\int_{{{\mathbb{T} }^3}}|v(t,x)|^2dx, \quad \forall t\in [0,T].\nonumber \end{align}</description>

      <title>Rigorous Derivation of the Wave Kinetic Equation for $\beta$-FPUT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave kinetic theory has been suggested as a way to understand the longtime statistical behavior of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system, with the aim of determining the thermalization time scale. The latter has been a major problem since the model was introduced in the 1950s. In this thesis we establish the wave kinetic equation for a reduced evolution equation obtained from the $\beta$-FPUT system by removing the non-resonant terms. We work in the kinetic limit $N\to \infty$ and $\beta\to 0$ under the scaling laws $\beta=N^{-\gamma}$ with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. The result holds up to the sub-kinetic time scale $T=N^{-\epsilon}\min\bigl(N,N^{5\gamma/4}\bigr)=N^{-\epsilon}T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{5/8}$ for $\epsilon\ll 1$, where $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$ represents the kinetic (thermalization) timescale. The novelties of this work include the treatment of non-polynomial dispersion relations, and the introduction of a robust phase renormalization argument to cancel dangerous divergent interactions.</description>

      <title>Change of bifurcation type in 2D free boundary model of a moving cell with nonlinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a 2D free boundary problem with nonlinear diffusion that models a living cell moving on a substrate. We prove that this nonlinearity results in a qualitative of solution behavior compared to the linear diffusion case (Rybalko et al. TAMS 2023), namely the switch between direct and inverse pitchfork bifurcation.
  Our objectives are twofold:
  (i) develop a rigorous framework to prove existence of bifurcation and determining its type (subcritical vs. superctitical) and (ii) the derivation of explicit analytical formulas that control the change of bifurcation type in terms of physical parameters and explain the underlying biophysical mechanisms.
  While the standard way of applying the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem via the solution operator seems difficult in our quasilinear PDE system, we apply the theorem directly, by developing a multidimensional, vectorial framework. To determine the bifurcation type, we extract the curvature of the bifurcating curve from the expansion of the solutions around the steady state. The formula for the curvature is obtained via a solvability condition where instead of the Fredholm alternative, we propose a test function trick, suited for free boundary problems.
  Our rigorous analytical results are in agreement with numerical observations from the physical literature in 1D (Drozdowski et al. Comm. Phys. 2023) and provide the first extension of this phenomenon to a 2D free boundary model.</description>

      <title>Rust Implementation of Finite Element Exterior Calculus on Coordinate-Free Simplicial Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents the development of a novel finite element library in Rust based on the principles of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). The library solves partial differential equations formulated using differential forms on abstract, coordinate-free simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions, employing an intrinsic Riemannian metric derived from edge lengths via Regge Calculus. We focus on solving elliptic Hodge-Laplace eigenvalue and source problems on the nD de Rham complex. We restrict ourselves to first-order Whitney basis functions. The implementation is partially verified through convergence studies.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods for fully nonlinear degenerate diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose finite difference methods for degenerate fully nonlinear elliptic equations and prove the convergence of the schemes. Our focus is on the pure equation and a related free boundary problem of transmission type. The cornerstone of our argument is a regularisation procedure. It decouples the degeneracy term from the elliptic operator driving the diffusion process. In the free boundary setting, the absence of degenerate ellipticity entails new, genuine difficulties. To bypass them, we resort to the intrinsic properties of the regularised problem. We present numerical experiments supporting our theoretical results. Our methods are flexible, and our approach can be extended to a broader class of non-variational problems.</description>

      <title>A clustering theorem in fractional Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a general clustering result for the fractional Sobolev space $W^{s,p}$: whenever the positivity set of a function $u$ in a square has measure bounded from below by a multiple of the cube's volume, and the $W^{s,p}$-seminorm of $u$ is bounded from above by a convenient power of the cube's side, then $u$ is positive in a universally reduced cube. Our result aims at applications in regularity theory for fractional elliptic and parabolic equations. Also, by means of suitable interpolation inequalities, we show that clustering results in $W^{1,p}$ and $BV$, respectively, can be deduced as special cases.</description>

Abstract: This work studies the inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger equation $$ i\partial_t u-\mathcal{K}_{s,\lambda}u +F(x,u)=0 , \quad u(t,x):\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^N\to\mathbb{C}. $$ Here, $s\in\{1,2\}$, $N&gt;2s$ and $\lambda&gt;-\frac{(N-2)^2}{4}$. The linear Schr\"odinger operator reads $\mathcal{K}_{s,\lambda}:= (-\Delta)^s +(2-s)\frac{\lambda}{|x|^2}$ and the focusing source term is local or non-local $$F(x,u)\in\{|x|^{-2\tau}|u|^{2(q-1)}u,|x|^{-\tau}|u|^{p-2}(J_\alpha *|\cdot|^{-\tau}|u|^p)u\}.$$ The Riesz potential is $J_\alpha(x)=C_{N,\alpha}|x|^{-(N-\alpha)}$, for certain $0&lt;\alpha&lt;N$. The singular decaying term $|x|^{-2\tau}$, for some $\tau&gt;0$ gives a inhomogeneous non-linearity. One considers the inter-critical regime, namely $1+\frac{2(1-\tau)}N&lt;q&lt;1+\frac{2(1-\tau)}{N-2s}$ and $1+\frac{2-2\tau+\alpha}{N}&lt;p&lt;1+\frac{2-2\tau+\alpha}{N-2s}$. The purpose is to prove the finite time blow-up of solutions with datum in the energy space, non necessarily radial or with finite variance. The assumption on the data is expressed in terms of non-conserved quantities. This is weaker than the ground state threshold standard condition. The blow-up under the ground threshold or with negative energy are consequences. The proof is based on Morawetz estimates and a non-global ordinary differential inequality.</description>

      <title>New solutions for the Lane-Emden problem on planar domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Lane-Emden problem on planar domains. When the exponent is large, the existence and multiplicity of solutions strongly depend on the geometric properties of the domain, which also deeply affect their qualitative behavior. Remarkably, a wide variety of solutions, both positive and sign-changing, have been found when the exponent is sufficiently large. In this paper, we focus on this topic and fine new sign-changing solutions that exhibit an unexpected concentration phenomenon as the exponent approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>A new class of anisotropic double phase problems: exponents depending on solutions and their gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce two novel classes of quasilinear elliptic equations, each driven by the double phase operator with variable exponents. The first class features a new double phase equation where exponents depend on the gradient of the solution. We delve into proving various properties of the corresponding Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces, including the $\Delta_2$ property, uniform convexity, density and compact embedding. Additionally, we explore the characteristics of the new double phase operator, such as continuity, strict monotonicity, and the (S$_+$)-property. Employing both variational and nonvariational methods, we establish the existence of solutions for this inaugural class of double phase equations. In the second category, the treatment of exponents is dependent on the solution itself. This class differs from the first one due to the unavailability of suitable Musielak-Orlicz Sobolev spaces. For this reason, we employ a perturbation argument that leads to the classical double phase class. These two new classes highlight how different physical processes like the movement of special fluids through porous materials, phase changes, and fluid dynamics interact with each other. Our results are novel in this context and includes a self-contained techniques.</description>

      <title>On the hierarchy of plate models for a singularly perturbed multi-well nonlinear elastic energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the celebrated work of Friesecke, James and M\"uller '06 the authors derive a hierarchy of models for plates by carefully analyzing the $\Gamma$-convergence of the rescaled nonlinear elastic energy. The key ingredient of their proofs is the rigidity estimate proved in an earlier work of theirs. Here we consider the case in which the elastic energy has a multi-well structure: this type of functional arises, for example, in the study of solid-solid phase transitions. Since the rigidity estimate fails in the case of compatible wells, we follow Alicandro, Dal Maso, Lazzaroni and Palombaro '18 and add a regularization term to the energy that penalizes jumps from one well to another, leading to good compactness properties. In this setting we recover the full hierarchy of plate models with an explicit dependence on the wells. Finally, we study the convergence of energy minimizers with suitable external forces and full Neumann boundary conditions. To do so, we adapt the definition of optimal rotations introduced by Maor, Mora '21.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for interacting species</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of the Robin heat kernel on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary for Robin parameter $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$, expressed as a spectral expansion in terms of Robin eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. For $\alpha&gt;0$, the proof relies on trace Sobolev inequalities and eigenfunction estimates, while the $\a&lt;0$ case requires new techniques to deal with $L^\infty$ estimates of Robin eigenfunctions. Our results unify the classical Dirichlet and Neumann cases while extending to the less-studied negative parameter regime.</description>

      <title>On spatial decay for coherent states of the Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation
  $$\partial_t u - H \partial_x^2 u = -\partial_x(u^2)$$
  that are localized in a reference frame moving to the right with constant speed. We show that any such solution that decays at least like $\langle x\rangle^{-1-\epsilon}$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$ in a comoving coordinate frame must in fact decay like $\langle x\rangle^{-2}$. In view of the explicit soliton solutions, this decay rate is sharp. Our proof has two main ingredients. The first is microlocal dispersive estimates for the Benjamin-Ono equation in a moving frame, which allow us to prove spatial decay of the solution provided the nonlinearity has sufficient decay. The second is a careful normal form analysis, which allows us to obtain rapid decay of the nonlinearity for a transformed equation assuming only modest decay of the solution. Our arguments are entirely time dependent, and do not require the solution to be an exact traveling wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study superlinear systems that give rise to free boundaries. Such systems appear for example from the minimization of the energy functional $$ \int_{\Omega}\left(|\nabla\mathbf{u}|^2+\frac2p|\mathbf{u}|^p\right),\quad 0&lt;p&lt;1, $$ but solutions can be also understood in an ad hoc viscosity way. First, we prove the optimal regularity of minimizers using a variational approach. Then, we apply a linearization technique to establish the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of the ``flat'' part of the free boundary via a viscosity method. Finally, for minimizing free boundaries, we extend this result to analyticity.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Magnetohydrodynamics Models as Scaling Limits of Stochastic Induction Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic properties of a stochastic model for the induction equations of the magnetic field in a three dimensional periodic domain. The turbulent velocity field driving the electromotive force on the magnetic field is modeled by a noise white in time. For this model we rigorously take a scaling limit leading to a deterministic model. While in case of isotropic turbulence this produces an additional dissipation in the limit model which influences also the decay rate of the Magnetic field in the stochastic model, the case of turbulence devoloped in a preferential direction allows us to find a dynamo effect.</description>

      <title>Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann Eigenvalues on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Sigma$ in a Riemannian surface $M$ satisfying certain curvature condition, we prove that $$\mu_{3-\beta_1} \leq \lambda_{1},$$ where $\mu_k$ ($\lambda_k$ resp.) is the $k$-th Neumann (Dirichlet resp.) Laplacian eigenvalue on $\Sigma$ and $\beta_1$ is the first Betti number of $\Sigma.$ If $\Sigma$ is smooth and simply connected, we can further derive the strict inequality $
\mu_{3}&lt; \lambda_{1}. $
This extends previous results on the Euclidean space to various curved surfaces, including the flat cylinder, the hyperbolic plane, hyperbolic cusp, collar, funnel, and minimal surfaces such as catenoid and helicoid. The novelty of the paper lies in comparing Dirichlet and Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues via the variational principle of the Hodge Laplacian on $1$-forms on a surface, extending the variational principle on vector fields in the Euclidean plane as developed by Rohleder. The comparison is reduced to the existence of a distance function with appropriate curvature conditions on its level sets.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young driver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise. We first obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs under the assumption that the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, by a modified Picard iteration method. Then, we derive the comparison principle by analyzing associated linear BSDEs and further establish regularity results for the solutions. Finally, by combining the regularity results with a localization argument, we extend the well-posedness result to the case where $\eta(t,x)$ is unbounded. As applications, we derive nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of partial differential equations with Young drivers (Young PDEs), and further investigate BSDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficient functions, as well as linear stochastic heat equations subject to Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Extremising eigenvalues of the GJMS operators in a fixed conformal class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$. If $s$ is a positive integer satisfying $2s&lt;n$, we let $P_g^s$ be the GJMS operator of order $2s$ in $M$. We investigate in this paper the extremal values taken by fixed eigenvalues of $P_h^s$ as $h$ runs through the whole conformal class $[g]$. These extremal values -- that we call throughout the paper \emph{conformal eigenvalues} -- are conformal invariants of $(M,g)$ and optimisers for these problems, when they exist, are known to not be smooth metrics in general. In this paper we develop a general framework that allows us to address the the existence theory for extremals of conformal eigenvalues. We define and investigate eigenvalues for singular conformal metrics, that we call \emph{generalised eigenvalues}. We develop a new variational framework for renormalised eigenvalues of any index over the set of admissible (singular) conformal factors: we obtain semi-continuity results and Euler-Lagrange equations for local extremals. Using this framework we prove, under mild assumptions on $(M,g)$ and $s$, several new (non)-existence results for extremals of renormalised eigenvalues over $[g]$. These include, among other results, a maximisation result for negative eigenvalues, the minimisation of the principal eigenvalue of $P_g^s$ and the analysis of the conformal eigenvalues of the round sphere $(\mathbb{S}^n, g_0)$. We also establish a strong connection between the existence of optimisers and (nodal) solutions of prescribed $Q$-curvature equations. Our analysis allows any order $s \ge 1$ and allows $P_g^s$ to have kernel. Previous results only covered the cases $s=1,2$ and $k=1,2$. Our work strongly generalises these results to any $s \ge 1$ and to eigenvalues of any order.</description>
