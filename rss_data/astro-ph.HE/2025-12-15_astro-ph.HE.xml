      <title>Impact of in-situ nuclear networks and atomic opacities on neutron star merger ejecta dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling binary neutron star merger (BNSM) ejecta evolution requires simulations involving hydrodynamics, nuclear reactions, and radiative processes. The impact of nuclear burning and atomic opacity is poorly understood and often treated with simplified prescriptions. We systematically investigate different treatments of nuclear heating, thermalization, and opacities in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of BNSM ejecta and kilonova light curves. Ejecta from long-term numerical-relativity simulations are evolved to ~30 days using a 2D ray-by-ray approach. We compare simplified heating-rates, thermalization prescriptions, and gray opacities with in-situ nuclear networks (NN) that track energy deposition, and include a composition-dependent thermalization scheme and frequency-dependent, atomic-physics-based opacities. Coupling NN and hydrodynamics affects nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. Assuming homologous expansion alters the abundance evolution and produces a narrower second $r$-process peak and a third peak shifted to higher mass numbers. Nuclear heating back-reaction delays and reddens the early emission. A constant thermalization underestimates the early luminosity and overestimates the late emission. Analytical opacities yield dimmer and redder kilonovae at early times ($t\lesssim$ hour) and a prolonged emission at $t\gtrsim5$ days. Resolving the first hundreds of milliseconds of hydrodynamics is essential for robust nucleosynthesis calculations, and composition-dependent thermalization and frequency-dependent, atomic opacities are needed to accurately capture the ejecta temperature and kilonova brightness and color evolution. Analytic nuclear-power fits with simplified thermalization and opacities can reproduce the density and temperature evolution of the ejecta. [Abridged].</description>

      <title>Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) II: Discovery of five MSPs in M69 and M70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports recent discoveries from the Globular Clusters GMRT Pulsar Search (GCGPS) survey, which aims to uncover pulsars in the globular clusters (GCs) of the Milky Way using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). Utilising the Band-4 (550$-$750 MHz) and Band-3 (300$-$500 MHz) receivers, the survey targets GCs accessible to uGMRT ($-53^\circ\,&lt;\,\delta\,&lt;\,-17^\circ$), excluding the declination range that can be covered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The survey focuses on GCs that have not previously been searched with comparable sensitivity in these radio frequencies. In this paper, we present the discovery of the five MSPs in two GCs, $-$ NGC~6637 (M69) and NGC~6681 (M70), each hosting MSPs identified here for the first time. Observations of M69 led to the discovery of two MSPs: J1831$-$3220A (M69A) and J1831$-$3220B (M69B), both of which we localize with arcsecond precision using interferometric imaging. Observations of M70 resulted in three new MSPs: J1843$-$3217A (M70A), J1843$-$3217B (M70B), and J1843$-$3217C (M70C). Although direct imaging did not yield precise localizations for these MSPs, we provide initial estimates based on uGMRT beam forming and imaging analysis. Additionally, we present preliminary imaging results for other observed GCs, and in cases of non-detections, we report upper limits on pulsed emission based on the rms noise levels in the image plane.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>Probable Quasi-Periodic Oscillations in the {\tt TESS} observations of blazars in the Swift X-ray Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents possible quasi-periodic oscillations in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observations of blazars that are in the 157-month hard X-ray survey done by Swift's Burst Alert Telescope. We report observations from four sources, J1104.4+3812, J1654.0+3946, J0353.4-6830, and J1941.3-6216, that show at least 3$\sigma$ local significance in generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet Z-transform methods. These results are also checked using a continuous autoregressive moving average analysis that also predicts the absent data tentatively using stochastic differential equations. Each of these four sources exhibits a nominal QPO signal frequency in the range of 0.5--1.1 d$^{-1}$, resulting in at least 5 putative cycles. However, when the number of frequencies examined and the number of sources examined are both taken into account, the global significances are reduced to $\approx2.2\sigma$ for J1654.0+3964 (Mrk 501), and to $\approx1.9\sigma$ for other sources. These QPOs are thought to arise from the processes within the relativistic jet. Plausible explanations include the kink instability, which arises due to current-driven instabilities in the plasma or the precession of substructures, or mini-jets, within the jets.</description>

      <title>The energy structure function of fast radio bursts supports a stochastic origin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has remained a mystery up to now. There are two kinds of process invoking neutron stars as an origin of FRBs, namely inner-driven starquakes and outer-driven collisions with interstellar objects (ISOs). The former origin should exhibit an earthquake-like statistical behavior while the latter should show a stochastic process. In this paper, we introduce a new statistical method by making use of the energy structure function of active repeating FRBs and earthquakes. We find that the energy structure function of FRBs exhibits a very different statistical behavior compared to that of earthquakes. On small time-interval scales, the energy of an earthquake show a tendency to decay with time-interval and the energy difference of a pair of events increases with time-interval. Such a behavior is not found in FRBs, whose energy function is very similar to those of a stochastic process. Our result shows that repeating FRBs may have an origin process differing from that of earthquakes, i.e., FRBs arise from a series of unrelated events such as collisions of a neutron star with ISOs.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray "echo" from sources at cosmological distances. While these contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray "echo", it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 9\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impacts of hydrogen envelope on supernova fallback and the resulting compact remnant masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fallback in core-collapse supernovae plays a central role in setting compact-remnant masses and may produce late-time emission. In hydrogen rich progenitors, the reverse shock arising at the hydrogen-helium interface has the potential to dramatically enhance fallback, yet its overall impact across a broad explosion-energy range has not been systematically quantified. Using one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations for metal-poor progenitors with $M_{\rm ZAMS}=18$-$28\,M_\odot$ and models with and without hydrogen envelopes, we explore fallback over explosion energies of $10^{48}$-$10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$. We find a robust and universal mass-transition behaviour: when the explosion energy reaches only $2$-$3$ times the binding energy of the hydrogen envelope, the reverse shock returns to the centre and sharply increases the remnant mass by $\gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$. Above this threshold, the reverse shock escapes and hydrogen-rich and stripped-envelope progenitors yield nearly identical remnant masses. By normalizing the results with the envelope binding energy, we show that all progenitor models converge to a common fallback relation. We further provide a simple analytic prescription that connects explosion energy, hydrogen-envelope binding energy, and final compact-remnant mass. This relation provides an important link between progenitor properties and compact-remnant masses, and is useful for population-synthesis and galactic chemical-evolution studies.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the cosmic ray nickel energy spectrum from 10 GeV/n to 2 TeV/n with the DAMPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel, one of the most stable elements alongside iron, is the most abundant heavy element beyond iron in cosmic rays. With DAMPE's excellent charge resolution and broad energy range, a high-precision energy spectrum provides valuable insights into the acceleration sources of heavy nuclei and their propagation through the interstellar medium. In this analysis, we report the direct measurement of cosmic-ray nickel spectrum from 10 GeV/n to 2 TeV/n with nine years of flight data. The nickel spectrum is consistent with a single power law with spectral index -2.60 +/- 0.03 from 40 GeV/n to 1 TeV/n. This work provides an accurate measurement of differential flux of nickel with kinetic energy extending to TeV/n for the first time.</description>

      <title>The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.</description>

      <title>JWST and HST observations of the host galaxy and supernova, SN 2024aihh in EP240801a at z=1.67</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the counterpart of EP240801a, at z=1.67, the first fast X-ray transient (FXT) identified as an X-ray flash (XRF) by the Einstein Probe (EP) and Fermi-GBM. Our observations reveal strong photometric and spectroscopic evidence for an associated broad-lined Type Ic supernova (SN) SN 2024aihh, the most distant spectroscopically identified gamma ray-burst (GRB)-SN to date. The SN exhibits similar luminosity and light curve evolution to the proto-type GRB-SN 1998bw with an absolute magnitude of the SN at $\sim$23 days rest-frame of $M_{F140W} \approx$-19 mag. The SN is located in a host galaxy with complex morphology at a large ($\sim$6 kpc) offset in a region of relatively low surface brightness. The region around the SN has a modest star formation rate and is dominated by an intermediate mass-weighted age (1.4$\pm$0.3 Gyr) population, despite the apparent presence of a young, massive broad-lined Type Ic SN progenitor. These observations demonstrate that observations with HST and JWST can greatly extend the redshift range over which the GRB/FXT-SN connection can be studied, including in relatively low luminosity, X-ray rich events. They demonstrate little apparent evolution in the SN properties from local examples despite EP240801a originating from an epoch 10 Gyr ago.</description>

      <title>Ultra-relativistic journeys through compact astrophysical objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that, for constant density stars, there is a critical value $\Lambda^{*}=1$ for the dimensionless density parameter $\Lambda\equiv 4\pi R^2\rho_{\text{max}}$ of the star above which the asymptotically measured travel time $T_{\text{s}}$ along a semi-circular trajectory that connects two antipodal points on the surface of the star is {\it shorter} than the travel time $T_{\text{c}}$ along the (shorter) straight-line trajectory that connects the two antipodal points through the center of the compact star [here $\{R,\rho_{\text{max}}\}$ are respectively the radius and the maximum density of the compact astrophysical object]. This intriguing observation provides a nice illustration of the general relativistic time dilation (redshift) effect in highly curved spacetimes. One expects that generic compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are smaller than some critical value $\Lambda^*$ would be characterized by the `normal' relation $T_{\text{c}}\leq T_{\text{s}}$ for the travel times between the two antipodal points. Motivated by this expectation, in the present paper we prove, using analytical techniques, that spherically symmetric compact astrophysical objects whose dimensionless density parameters are bounded from above by the model-independent relation $\Lambda\leq\Lambda^*={3\over2}[1-({{2}\over{\pi}})^{2/5}]$ are always (regardless of their inner density profiles) characterized by the normal dimensionless ratio $T_{\text{c}}/T_{\text{s}}\leq1$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on light QCD and CP-violating axions from the death line of rotation-powered pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11023</link>

Abstract: For axions that couple to nucleons, the presence of dense nuclear matter can displace the axion from its vacuum minimum, sourcing large field gradients around neutron stars (and, more generally, compact objects). These gradients, which we refer to as axion hair, couple to the local background magnetic field, inducing a large voltage drop near the surface of the star; here, we demonstrate that the presence of axion hair decouples local near-field particle acceleration in the open magnetic field line bundle from the rotational frequency of the pulsar itself. This is significant as the non-observation of old slowly-rotating pulsars is attributed to the fact the rotationally-induced electric fields are not strong enough to sustain $e^\pm$ pair production. In this work, we review the evidence for the existence for `pulsar death', i.e. the threshold at which $e^\pm$ pair production (and thus, by association, coherent radio emission) ceases, and demonstrate using both semi-analytics and particle-in-cell simulations that the existence of axion hair can dramatically extend pulsar lifetimes. We show that the non-observation of extremely old, slowly rotating, pulsars allows for a new probe of light QCD and CP-violating axions. We also demonstrate how the observation of emission from both poles of pulsars with nearly orthogonal rotational and magnetic axes, as seen e.g. in PSR J1906+0746, can be used to set competitive limits on CP-violating axion-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>Chemical composition and enrichment of the Centaurus cluster core seen by XRISM/Resolve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot, X-ray emitting atmospheres pervading galaxy clusters are rich in metals, which have been synthesised and released by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, core-collapse supernovae (SNcc) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) over cosmic history. This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements. We also briefly discuss the possibility of a multi-metallicity gas phase in this respect.</description>

      <title>Effects of Varied Cosmic Ray Feedback from AGN on Massive Galaxy Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Crab Nebula Revisited Using HST/WFC3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been over 24 years since the iconic Crab Nebula has been visited by the high spatial resolution eye of the Hubble Space Telescope. The expanding nebula is dynamic on these timescales, with many of the outer filaments of the nebula known to show proper motions of 0.3'' or more per year. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to compare the fine scale structure of the nebula with recent data at other wavelengths. We have re-observed the Crab in an HST Cycle 31 program using the WFC3 camera and filters similar to those previously used to make the existing mosaic that dates from 1999-2000 and was obtained with the WFPC2 camera. Two central fields were observed with the F487N filter, providing an uncontaminated hydrogen band for comparison. We also observed two primarily continuum band filters (F547M and F763M), allowing us to study the optical synchrotron nebula component of the Crab's emission. We compare these new data to the first epoch of WFPC2 data as well as to more contemporaneous NIR/MIR imagery from JWST. Finally, we highlight two previously unrecognized groupings of filaments with similar emission characteristics that are nearly diametrically opposed from the pulsar but whose origin remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Occultations with VERITAS: Observations and Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occultations, the covering up of one celestial body by another celestial body, have been used in astronomy for millennia to learn about the sun and moon. Since 2018, VERITAS has implemented a program to detect predicted asteroid occultations, where an asteroid covers up a star. VERITAS has attempted to observe over 100 occultations to date and successfully observed 20 occultations. With these occultations, VERITAS can directly measure the smallest angular diameters of any instrument or technique in the optical for stars between magnitude 9 and 13. Each angular diameter is measured by fitting the diffraction pattern observed by the central VERITAS pixel at the start and end of an occultation. Once a planned FADC upgrade is complete, VERITAS will begin a program to search for serendipitous occultations within its full field of view (3 deg). Serendipitous occultations of sub-km trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) have the potential to constrain models of solar system formation. This work details how VERITAS predicts and observes occultations as well as the overall status of the asteroid occultation program and future steps for observing occultations of both asteroids and TNOs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is a field that has been growing in importance since the early 2010s due to the increasing accuracy of classification models and hardware advances that have enabled faster training on large datasets. In the field of astronomy, tree-based models and simple neural networks have recently garnered attention as a means of classifying celestial objects based on photometric data. We apply common tree-based models to assess performance of these models for discriminating objects with similar photometric signals, pulsars and black holes.
  We also train a RNN on a downsampled and normalized version of the raw signal data to examine its potential as a model capable of object discrimination and classification in real-time.</description>

      <title>The hydrogen-free circumstellar interaction in the Type Ib supernova 2021efd: A clue to the mechanism of the helium-layer stripping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type IIb, Ib, and Ic supernovae (SNe), originate from the explosions of massive stars whose outer envelopes have been largely removed during their lifetimes. The main stripping mechanism for the hydrogen (H) envelope in the progenitors of SESNe is often considered to be interaction with a binary companion, while that for the helium (He) layer is unclear. We conducted photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ib SN 2021efd, which shows signs of interaction with H-free circumstellar material (CSM). Around 30 days after the r-band light curve (LC) peak, until at least ~ 770 days, its LCs display excessive luminosity compared to regular SESNe and at least three distinct peaks. The light curve evolution is similar to that of SN 2019tsf, whose previously unpublished spectrum at 400 days is also presented here. The nebular spectrum of SN 2021efd shows narrow emission lines (~ 1000 km/s) in various species. Our observations suggest that SN 2021efd is a Type Ib SN interacting with CSM with the following parameters: The estimated CSM mass, composition, and distribution are at least a few times 0.1 M_sun, H-free, and clumpy, respectively. Based on the estimated ejecta properties, we conclude that this event is a transitional SN whose progenitor was experiencing He-layer stripping at the epoch of the explosion, and was on the way to becoming a carbon-oxygen star from a He star. The estimated CSM properties suggest that the progenitor had some episodic mass ejections with a rate of ~ 0.001-0.01 M_sun/yr for the last decade and slightly smaller before this final phase at least from ~ 200 years before the explosion, for the assumed CSM velocity of 100 km/s. For the case of ~ 1000 km/s, the necessary mass-loss rate would be increased by a factor of ten, and the timescales decreased by a factor of ten.</description>

      <title>Microphysics of diffusive shock acceleration: impact on the spectrum of accelerated particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.15624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusive shock acceleration at collisionless shocks remains the most likely process for accelerating particles in a variety of astrophysical sources. While the standard prediction for strong shocks is that the spectrum of accelerated particles is universal, $f(p)\propto p^{-4}$, numerous phenomena affect this simple conclusion. In general, the non-linear dynamical reaction of accelerated particles leads to a concave spectrum, steeper than $p^{-4}$ at momenta below a few tens of GeV/c and harder than the standard prediction at high energies. However, the non-linear effects become important in the presence of magnetic field amplification, which in turn leads to higher values of the maximum momentum $p_{max}$. It was recently discovered that the self-generated perturbations that enhance particle scattering, when advected downstream, move in the same direction as the background plasma, so that the effective compression factor at the shock decreases and the spectrum becomes steeper. We investigate the implications of the excitation of the non-resonant streaming instability on these spectral deformations, the dependence of the spectral steepening on the shock velocity and the role played by the injection momentum.</description>

      <title>Modeling reflection spectra of super-Eddington X-ray sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic reflection is a common feature in the X-ray observations of accreting compact objects. We present reflux, a new X-ray reflection model for spectral analysis of super-Eddington sources. We develop two relativistic reflection frameworks for super-Eddington accretion: a slim-disk model that self-consistently accounts for disk thickening and self-shadowing, and an optically thick wind model that treats reflection off a funnel-shaped outflow. The slim-disk model offers a geometry where the inner disk thickness is proportional to radius, becoming thicker as the mass accretion rate increases. The wind model measures the opening angle of the funnel, the wind speed, and wind acceleration radius. The slim-disk profile reduces the brightness of the blue horn in the Fe K emission line for a fixed emissivity and significantly changes the intensity profile for a lamppost geometry. The wind model shows a blue-shifted iron line due to high velocity outflows. Both models assume a spherically symmetric spacetime. We apply the wind model to the XMM-Newton spectrum of the tidal disruption event Swift J1644+57, where the Fe K profile is expected to be shaped by scattering in an outflowing funnel. We constrain the opening angle of the funnel and find a high velocity of the wind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of neutrino flavor conversion on the supernova mechanism is yet to be fully understood. We present multi-energy and multi-angle solutions of the neutrino quantum kinetic equations in three flavors, without employing any attenuation term for the neutrino self-interaction strength and taking into account neutrino advection and non-forward collisions with the background medium. Flavor evolution is explored within a spherically symmetric shell surrounding the region of neutrino decoupling in the interior of a core-collapse supernova, relying on the output of a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova model with a progenitor mass of $18.6 M_\odot$. We select two representative post-bounce times: $t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s (no angular crossings are present and flavor conversion is triggered by slow collective effects) and $t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s (angular crossings trigger fast flavor instabilities). We find that flavor equipartition is achieved for the late post-bounce time ($t_{\rm pb} = 1$ s), where the (anti)neutrino emission properties among different flavors tend to approach each other. In this case, $\bar\nu_e$ tends to $\bar\nu_x = (\bar\nu_\mu + \bar\nu_\tau)/2$ and a similar trend holds for neutrinos. However, flavor equipartition does not occur for our early post-bounce time ($t_{\rm pb} = 0.25$ s). Accounting for weak-magnetism corrections, crossings in the $\mu$ and $\tau$ lepton number angular distributions arise; however, such crossings have a magnitude smaller than the one occurring in the electron sector and negligibly affect flavor evolution. Because of flavor conversion, the neutrino heating rate increases up to $30\%$ with respect to the case where flavor conversion is neglected.</description>

      <title>Patterns of X-ray and $\gamma$-ray Flares: from Blazar to Maganetar and Sun</title>

Abstract: Using Gaussian process methods, we analyzed the light curves of three extreme solar X-ray flares observed by the RHESSI satellite. Their variability characteristics were then compared with those of HXMT-HE X-ray burst (XRB; in SGR 1935+2154) associated with fast radio burst (FRB) 200428 and blazar $\gamma$-ray giant flares, to investigate the origins of these extreme flaring events. The variability patterns of the solar X-ray flares follow the stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) model. The derived timescales $t_{\rm B\underline{} steep}$ and $t_{\rm B\underline{~} flat}$ (corresponding to PSD breaks) are in the range of 4-7 s and 16-53 s, respectively. The FRB-associated HXMT-HE burst has a $Q$ value near 0.3, matching those of the solar flares occurred on 23 July 2002 (flare 1) and 3 November 2003 (flare 2). By contrast, blazar $\gamma$-ray giant flares show $Q &gt;$ 0.3, similar to the solar flare occurred on 25 February 2014 (flare 3). We proposed that the critically damped state of the system may be the condition triggering the association between the XRB in SGR 1935+2154 and the FRB. In this scenario, the critical damping $Q$ value of the system is around 0.3, not the theoretical 0.5. The similarity in $Q$ values might imply that the FRB-associated HXMT-HE XRB and solar X-ray flares 1 $\&amp;$ 2 share comparable dynamic behavior, while blazar $\gamma$-ray flares and solar X-ray flare 3 exhibit another distinct but similar dynamic behavior. Like solar X-ray flares, these extreme flares may all be related to the magnetic reconnection process.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Extragalactic Magnetic Field: Auger Data Meet UHECR Propagation Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses from the Pierre Auger Collaboration suggest correlations between the arrival directions of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) and catalogs of starburst galaxies (SGBs) and jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We revisit these analyses using the same methodology as \auger , but explicitly incorporating UHECR deflections in turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields (EGMFs). We demonstrate that while for SBGs the same sources as for the generic \auger\ analysis dominate the catalog correlations, jetted AGNs are dominated by Centaurus~A when accounting for source distances and deflections. Using our framework, we derive 90\% confidence level upper limits on the local EGMF strength of 4.4~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for SBGs and 6.7~nG~Mpc$^{1/2}$ for jetted AGNs. Assuming instead that the UHECR deflections predominantly arise from the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), we obtain a GMF upper limit of $1.4 \, \mu$G~kpc$^{1/2}$ for a Galactic halo size of 30~kpc.</description>

      <title>Detection of low-luminosity X-ray pulsations from the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511-3057: An ever-thinning thread between bright accretion and sub-luminous states</title>

Abstract: After nearly a decade in quiescence, the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511$-$3057 displayed a new outburst on 2025 February 11, its third since discovery, following previous activity in 2009 and 2015. We report on an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more than twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well described by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed 0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \sim 7 \times 10^{33} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To place this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in 2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X,q} \sim 2 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this comparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level during the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late stage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller regime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with an amplitude peaking at $\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a spectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we report a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 60 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux density at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following a decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data from 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a luminosity level of $L_X \sim 1 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. We discuss our findings in the context of other accreting millisecond pulsars and draw comparisons with transitional systems in the sub-luminous disk state.</description>

      <title>A Mass-Independent Damping Timescale in Black Hole Accretion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. Here, we investigate the long-term hard X-ray CDTs of 106 black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Unexpectedly, for the first time, we discover a mass-independent CDT in these black hole accretion systems, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk--corona--jet connection.</description>

      <title>AT2022zod: An Unusual Tidal Disruption Event in an Elliptical Galaxy at Redshift 0.11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have long been hypothesized as valuable indicators of black holes, offering insight into their demographics and behaviour out to high redshift. TDEs have also enabled the discovery of a few Massive Black Holes (MBHs) with inferred masses of $10^4$--$10^6\,M_\odot$, often associated with the nuclei of dwarf galaxies or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). Here we present AT2022zod, an extreme and short-lived optical flare in an elliptical galaxy at z=0.11, residing within 3kpc of the galaxy's centre. Its luminosity and ~30-day duration make it unlikely to have originated from the host galaxy's central supermassive black hole (SMBH), which estimate to have a mass around $10^8\,M_\odot$. Assuming that the emission mechanism is consistent with known observed TDEs, we find that such a rapidly evolving transient could either be produced by a MBH in the intermediate-mass range or, alternatively, result from the tidal disruption of a star on a non-parabolic orbit around the central SMBH. We suggest that the most plausible origin for AT2022zod is the tidal disruption of a star by a MBH embedded in a UCD. As the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time comes online, we propose that AT2022zod serves as an important event for refining search strategies and characterization techniques for intermediate-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Wind-mediated Eddington-limited emission in a $10^{4}M_\odot$ Black Hole Tidal Disruption Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have already produced tens of strong candidate flares, and their number will greatly increase with upcoming wide field surveys. Nevertheless, the origin of the measured luminosity peak at early times is still unknown, and the ultimate sources of energy dissipation in TDEs are not fully understood. Here we present the first three-dimensional end-to-end simulation of a TDE by a $10^{4}M_\odot$ intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with realistic parameters, run with the radiation-hydrodynamics code RICH. We find that the stellar debris fails to circularize efficiently, while a low-density, radiation-driven wind forms near pericenter and expands quasi-spherically. Radiation is advected by this outflow and released at the photosphere, which expands to radii of $\approx10^{13}$ cm and reaches temperatures of ~few $10^{4}$K at the peak of the light curve. The resulting luminosity briefly exceeds the Eddington limit before settling near that value. We systematically test the numerical convergence of our simulation by running it at three resolutions. While the nozzle shock at pericenter may be under-resolved, we find that global results are qualitatively converged and, largely, quantitatively robust. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST (g and r band) and ULTRASAT (near UV) will be able to observe events like our simulated IMBH TDE up to redshifts of z$\approx$0.1 and z$\approx$0.06, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fast LISA Likelihood Approximations by Downsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is due to launch in the mid-2030s. A key challenge for LISA data analysis is efficient Bayesian inference with parametrised gravitational-wave models, particularly for early inspirals of low- and intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, where time series can contain $\sim 10^8$-$10^9$ samples and naive likelihood evaluations become prohibitively expensive. For purely simulated studies, we present a simple time-domain likelihood-approximation scheme for such signals. The method retains only a small subset of samples and defines a modified noise-weighted inner product on this reduced set that closely reproduces the original inner product on the waveform manifold. Because this alters the effective noise model, the scheme is intended for simulated LISA data rather than direct analysis of real LISA data. In our examples, the resulting posteriors agree to high accuracy with those obtained using much denser sampling, while retaining only $10^3$-$10^4$ samples. The computational cost then scales linearly with the number of retained samples $N_s$, so the speed-up is roughly $N/N_s$, where $N$ is the original data length; for realistic LISA-like datasets with $N\sim10^8$-$10^9$ this would correspond to gains of order $10^4$-$10^6$ over straightforward frequency-domain likelihood evaluations of the full dataset. The time-domain formulation is particularly convenient for incorporating waveform modifications from non-trivial astrophysical environments or alternative-gravity effects. The results presented here provide the theoretical basis for the software package \texttt{Dolfen}.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</description>
