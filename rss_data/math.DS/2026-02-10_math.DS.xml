      <title>Fractional Gr\"onwall--Wendroff Inequalities for Implicit Systems with Distributed Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work establishes a comprehensive analytical framework for studying implicit fractional differential systems with distributed memory and time delays. We develop novel fractional integral inequalities of Gr\"onwall--Wendroff type that are specifically adapted to handle multivariate functions with singular kernels and implicit dependencies. These inequalities provide essential a priori estimates for analyzing complex memory-dependent systems. Building upon these results, we prove general existence and uniqueness theorems for implicit fractional differential equations using fixed-point theory in appropriately weighted Banach spaces. Furthermore, we establish Ulam--Hyers stability criteria, demonstrating that small perturbations in the governing equations lead to proportionally small deviations in solutions. The theoretical advances are applied to the fractional FitzHugh--Nagumo model with delay (FHN-$\alpha$-$\tau$), a neurodynamical system exhibiting both subdiffusive memory and discrete time delays. Our analysis yields rigorous conditions for the existence of limit cycles corresponding to action potentials, along with asymptotic stability criteria. The results reveal how fractional order $\alpha$ and delay $\tau$ jointly modulate neural excitability thresholds and dynamic regime transitions. This work bridges fundamental fractional calculus theory with applications in mathematical neuroscience, providing analytical tools for systems where present evolution depends non-trivially on historical states and intrinsic fractional rates of change.</description>

      <title>Quantitative fixed-point theorems with verifiable hypotheses: rates and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\dist)$ be a complete metric space and let $C\subseteq X$ be a closed invariant set. We study fixed points of maps $T\colon C\to C$ governed by a \emph{verifiable} contractive modulus. The modulus is encoded by a contractive gauge $\omega$ and a certified constant $\kappa=\sup_{0&lt;r\le R}\omega(r)/r&lt;1$ on a computable working radius $R$. From this datum we derive explicit a priori bounds $\dist(x_n,x^\ast)\le \Phi(n;\kappa,\delta_0)$ for Picard iterates, a residual-to-error estimate, and a quantitative data dependence bound $\dist(x^\ast,y^\ast)\le (1-\kappa)^{-1}\sup_{x\in C}\dist(Tx,Sx)$. We further treat inexact evaluations $\dist(\tilde x_{n+1},T\tilde x_n)\le \eta_n$ and obtain certified resilience bounds with the same stability factor. The framework applies to Hammerstein--Volterra integral equations and to boundary value problems via Green operators, where kernel bounds yield certified convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control and Mittag-Leffler Stability of Caputo Fractional Systems with State-Dependent Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new sufficient conditions for Mittag-Leffler stability of Caputo fractional-order nonlinear systems with state-dependent delays. The central analytical tool is a class of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals that incorporate singular kernels of the form $\xi^{\alpha-1}$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$, coupling fractional memory effects with delay-induced dynamics in a unified framework. We prove that the resulting stability conditions reduce to computationally tractable linear matrix inequalities and derive explicit formulas for the maximum tolerable delay perturbation. Building on this stability foundation, we design an adaptive controller governed by fractional-order parameter update laws with $\sigma$-modification and a filter-based delay estimation mechanism that circumvents the need for classical state derivatives, which may not exist for fractional-order trajectories. The convergence analysis establishes ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system with a computable bound that vanishes as the regularization parameters approach zero. Numerical validation on a three-neuron fractional Hopfield network with state-dependent transmission delays demonstrates that the proposed adaptive scheme reduces cumulative control energy by 99.3\% and achieves an asymptotic state error two orders of magnitude smaller than a comparable fractional sliding mode controller.</description>

      <title>Global center of polynomial Newton system and its non-isochronicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a new compactification (toroidal compactification) and desingularization, we obtain a complete characterization of monodromy at infinity for polynomial Newton system of arbitrary degree, in which we establish an equivalence between the monodromy and the non-existence of 1/2-fractional formal invariant curves. Combining the complete characterization with either Darboux integrability or algebraic reducibility of local centers, we obtain conditions for all cases of global center. Furthermore, investigating the asymptotic behavior of the period function of orbits near infinity, we prove the non-isochronicity for the global center, which consequently solves an open problem proposed by Conti.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponents for Sparsely Coupled Linear Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies structured products of real matrices for which the top Lyapunov exponent can be accessed by reducing the dynamics to an amenable generalization of upper triangular matrices. Exploiting prescribed zero patterns (including block-triangularity and sparse decompositions, conveniently encoded by a directed sparsity graph), we obtain explicit, computable bounds and, in favorable cases, formulas for $\gamma_1$ by combining deterministic triangular controls with a suitable refinement of the Furstenberg--Kifer lemma for block-triangular products. The estimates apply both to tempered (possibly deterministic) sequences and to stationary ergodic random cocycles under standard integrability. We also discuss applications to perturbation models for linear systems, including low-rank updates, where the reduction converts the problem to lower-dimensional or scalar cocycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Brolin-Lyubich-Freire--Lopes--Ma\~n\'e equidistribution theorem for iterated preimages of a given non-exceptional value and Lyubich's periodic point version of it are foundational in the study of dynamics of rational functions of degree more than one on the complex projective line, and Drasin and the author studied a quantification of the former in a formalism of Nevanlinna theory or more specifically with the aid of Selberg's theorem. In this paper, we point out that the argument in that previous study have already yielded a better quantification of the Brolin-Lyubich-Freire--Lopes--Ma\~n\'e equidistribution theorem, and also point out that a similar argument also yields a quantification of Lyubich's theorem under an exponentwise version of the so called hypothesis H.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise fractional linear maps wzth three or more branches have been studied in several papers. For many Moebius maps the shape of the density of their invariant measurs can be written down exactly. However, if just two branches are linear, no explicit form is known. In this paper a partial solution is offered.</description>

      <title>A note on cocycles in $\mathbb{T}\times SO(3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note studies $C^{\infty}$-smooth cocycles in $\mathbb{T}\times SO(3)$ that have $0$ degree and are non-homotopic to constants. The study picks up from where the author's PhD thesis left the subject, and shows that, under a relevant and full measure arithmetic condition, such cocycles can be conjugated to a simple model. Moreover, under the same arithmetic condition, the cocycle can be conjugated arbitrarily close to constant cocycles by a $2$-periodic conjugation.</description>

      <title>Polytopes and $C^0$-Riemannian metrics with positive $h_{\rm top}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Reeb dynamics on starshaped hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$ arising as smoothings of convex polytopes. Using the $C^0$--stability of positive topological entropy for Reeb flows in dimension three from our joint work with Dahinden and Pirnapasov, we show that there exist starshaped polytopes $P$ such that for any starshaped smoothing of $\partial P$ the associated Reeb flows have positive topological entropy. This answers a question of Ostrover and Ginzburg.
  Similarly, we show that given a closed surface $M$ and a number $C&gt;0$, there exist continuous and non-differentiable Riemannian metrics $g$ on $S$ with $h_{\rm top}&gt;C$ in the sense that for any smoothing of $g$ the associated geodesic flows have $h_{\rm top}&gt;C$.</description>

      <title>The stability of boundary equilibria of three-dimensional Filippov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three-dimensional piecewise-smooth systems of ordinary differential equations, this paper characterises the stability of points that belong to a switching surface and are equilibria of exactly one of the two neighbouring pieces of the system. Stability is challenging to characterise when nearby orbits repeatedly switch between regular motion on one side of the switching surface, and sliding motion on the switching surface, as defined via Filippov's convention. We prove that in this case stability is governed by the behaviour of a global reinjection mechanism of a four-parameter family of piecewise-linear hybrid systems, and perform a detailed numerical study of this family.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theorems for Dynamical Systems with Infinite-Time Horizon Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal approximation theorems establish the expressive capacity of neural network architectures. For dynamical systems, existing results are limited to finite time horizons or systems with a globally stable equilibrium, leaving multistability and limit cycles unaddressed. We prove that Neural ODEs achieve $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness -- trajectories within error $\varepsilon$ except for initial conditions of measure $&lt; \delta$ -- over the \emph{infinite} time horizon $[0,\infty)$ for three target classes: (1) Morse-Smale systems (a structurally stable class) with hyperbolic fixed points, (2) Morse-Smale systems with hyperbolic limit cycles via exact period matching, and (3) systems with normally hyperbolic continuous attractors via discretization. We further establish a temporal generalization bound: $\varepsilon$-$\delta$ closeness implies $L^p$ error $\leq \varepsilon^p + \delta \cdot D^p$ for all $t \geq 0$, bridging topological guarantees to training metrics. These results provide the first universal approximation framework for multistable infinite-horizon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of topological entropy for free semigroup actions introduced by Bi\'s, we define the Pesin--Pitskel topological pressure for non-autonomous iterated function systems via the Carath\'eodory--Pesin structure. We show that this Pesin--Pitskel topological pressure coincides with the corresponding weighted topological pressure. Furthermore, we establish a variational principle asserting that, for any nonempty compact subset, the Pesin--Pitskel topological pressure equals the supremum of the associated measure-theoretic pressures over all Borel probability measures supported on that subset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physiological stress fundamentally alters disease susceptibility in aquatic environments. In this paper, we develop a stress-structured epidemiological model where host vulnerability is dynamically driven by water quality. Analytically, we establish that the system exhibits a classic forward bifurcation at $\mathcal{R}_0=1$, confirming that the basic reproduction number remains a valid threshold for eradication. However, stochastic analysis reveals a critical asymmetry not captured by deterministic thresholds. We show that while $\mathcal{R}_0$ predicts stability, the probability of an outbreak depends on the initial physiological state. Introducing infection into a stressed sub-population leads to immediate rapid growth of the disease, whereas introduction into the normal class faces a stochastic barrier that significantly delays the epidemic peak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct infinitely many diffeomorphisms of a Joyce manifold $M$ which achieve Yomdin's homological lower bound for topological entropy, imitating a recent construction of Farb-Looijenga for K3 surfaces. Moreover, following a recent paper by Crowley-Goette-Hertl, we show these diffeomorphisms act freely on a connected component of the Teichm\"uller space of $G_2$-metrics on $M$. We also discuss a putative analogy between dynamics on a $G_2$-manifold and that of an algebraic surface, and prove a theorem about its limitations.</description>

      <title>Strengthenings of Mazur's Conjecture for Higher Heegner Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative strengthenings of Mazur's conjecture regarding the non-torsion property of higher Heegner points on modular and Shimura curves, confirming both a vertical version for sufficiently large powers $n$ and a horizontal version for primes $p \gg 1$. Distinct from previous strategies by Cornut and Vatsal that relied on Ratner's theorems on unipotent flows and required restrictive hypotheses on level structures, our approach circumvents these constraints by exploiting the interplay between Galois orbits and Hecke orbits. By quantifying the relative size of these orbits, we reduce the problem to ergodic results concerning the equidistribution of Hecke operators and the classification of joining measures. This method allows for the analysis of simultaneous supersingular reductions without requiring the surjectivity of reduction maps.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft inspection and docking missions require controllers that can guarantee safety under thrust constraints and uncertainty. Input-constrained control barrier functions (ICCBFs) provide a framework for safety certification under bounded actuation; however, conventional ICCBF formulations can be overly conservative and exhibit limited robustness to uncertainty, leading to high fuel consumption and reduced mission feasibility. This paper proposes a framework in which the full hierarchy of class-$\mathcal{K}$ functions defining the ICCBF recursion is parameterized and learned, enabling localized shaping of the safe set and reduced conservatism. A control margin is computed efficiently using differential algebra to enable the learned continuous-time ICCBFs to be implemented on time-sampled dynamical systems typical of spacecraft proximity operations. A meta-reinforcement learning scheme is developed to train a policy that generates ICCBF parameters over a distribution of hidden physical parameters and uncertainties, using both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. Simulation results on cruise control, spacecraft inspection, and docking scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach maintains safety while reducing fuel consumption and improving feasibility relative to fixed class-$\mathcal{K}$ ICCBFs, with the RNN showing a particularly strong advantage in the more complex inspection case.</description>

      <title>Averaged Controllability of Time-Fractional Schr\"odinger Equations with Random Quantum Diffusivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of averaged controllability for the time-fractional Schrodinger equation, where the quantum diffusivity parameter is a random variable with a general probability distribution. First, by exploiting the analyticity of the Mittag-Leffler function and Muntz's theorem, we show that the simultaneous null controllability of the system can occur only for a countable set of realizations of the random diffusivity. In particular, this implies the impossibility of simultaneous null controllability for absolutely continuous random diffusivity. Next, we prove the lack of exact averaged controllability for absolutely continuous random variables, irrespective of the control time. Furthermore, we introduce a new two-parameter fractional characteristic function, which allows us to construct a class of random variables satisfying null averaged controllability at any time from any arbitrary sensor set of positive Lebesgue measure. This is achieved using an open-loop control belonging to L^\infty and independent of the random parameter. In particular, we obtain the null controllability of the fractional biharmonic diffusion equation. Finally, we conclude with several remarks and open problems that merit future investigation.</description>

      <title>Trajectory arclength reveals chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate that the phase space arclength of a trajectory, quantified by the time-averaged Lagrangian descriptor, is a robust and self-contained chaos indicator. By invoking Birkhoff's Ergodic Partition Theorem, we show that this scalar function distinguishes dynamical regimes via its power spectral density: for regular motion it converges to a delta function, whereas for chaotic trajectories the spectrum exhibits an inverse power-law $(1/\omega)$ driven by the phenomenon of dynamical stickiness. With this approach, we avoid the computation and simulation of the variational equations and the usage of neighboring orbits, making it the simplest geometrical chaos indicator derivable from Lagrangian descriptors. Its computational efficiency enables the study of high-dimensional systems and allows the generation of large datasets of classified initial conditions, ideal for training Machine Learning models. We validate these findings using the H\'enon-Heiles and the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam systems. By linking the geometrical properties of phase space to spectral analysis, this work provides the mathematical justification to establish Lagrangian descriptors as a rigorous, self-sufficient framework for the global analysis of chaos and regularity in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Expansive homeomorphisms on complexity quasi-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity quasi-metric, introduced by Schellekens, provides a topological framework where the asymmetric nature of computational comparisons -- stating that one algorithm is faster than another carries different information than stating the second is slower than the first -- finds precise mathematical expression. In this paper we develop a comprehensive theory of expansive homeomorphisms on complexity quasi-metric spaces. Our central result establishes that the scaling transformation $\psi_\alpha(f)(n)=\alpha f(n)$ is expansive on the complexity space $(\C,d_\C)$ if and only if $\alpha\neq 1$. The $\delta$-stable sets arising from this dynamics correspond exactly to asymptotic complexity classes, providing a dynamical characterisation of fundamental objects in complexity theory. We prove that the canonical coordinates associated with $\psi_\alpha$ are hyperbolic with contraction rate $\lambda=1/\alpha$ and establish a precise connection between orbit separation in the dynamical system and the classical time hierarchy theorem of Hartmanis and Stearns. We further investigate unstable sets, conjugate dynamics, and topological entropy estimates for the scaling map. Throughout, concrete algorithms and Python implementations accompany the proofs, making every result computationally reproducible. SageMath verification snippets are inlined alongside the examples, and the full code is available in the companion repository.</description>

      <title>Efficient $k$-Sign Consistency Verification of Hankel Matrices via Schur Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of certifying (strict) $k$-sign consistency of a matrix, that is, whether all of its $k$-th order minors share the same (strict) sign. Although this problem is generally of combinatorial complexity, we show that for Hankel matrices it can be significantly simplified: our sufficient condition requires checking only the $k$-th order minors of a reshaped Hankel matrix with $k$ rows. Remarkably, when applied to the Hankel operator, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Comparable results were known only in the setting of (strictly) $k$-positive Hankel matrices and operators, in which all minors of order up to $k$ have the same (strict) sign.
  More concretely, we derive a formula expressing the $k$-th order minors of Hankel matrices as nonnegative integer linear combinations of $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our derivation uses Schur polynomial theory to show that the $k$-th order minors of any matrix are nonnegative integer linear combinations of row-consecutive $k$-th order minors, meaning minors formed from distinct columns whose consecutive row indices need not coincide across columns. For Hankel matrices, these minors coincide -- up to sign changes arising from column swaps -- with the usual $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our main result then follows by showing that the sum of certain signed nonnegative integer coefficients equals the corresponding Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. In our problem, the nonnegativity of these coefficients ensures that negatively signed column permutations are cancelled by positively signed ones. Our results also extend naturally to Toeplitz matrices and operators, and we present a partial analogue for circulant matrices.</description>

      <title>An Approach for the Qualitative Graphical Representation of the Describing Function in Nonlinear Systems Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The describing function method is a useful tool for the qualitative analysis of limit cycles in the stability analysis of nonlinear systems. This method is inherently approximate; therefore, it should be used for a fast qualitative analysis of the considered systems. However, plotting the exact describing function requires heavy mathematical calculations, reducing interest in this method especially from the point of view of control education. The objective of this paper is to enhance the describing function method by providing a new approach for the qualitative plotting of the describing function for piecewise nonlinearities involving discontinuities. Unlike the standard method, the proposed approach allows for a straightforward, hand-drawn plotting of the describing function using the rules introduced in this paper, simply by analyzing the shape of the nonlinearity. The proposed case studies show that the limit cycles estimation performed using the standard exact plotting of the describing function yields the same qualitative results as those obtained using the proposed qualitative method for plotting the describing function.</description>

      <title>Time-Delayed Transformers for Data-Driven Modeling of Low-Dimensional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the time-delayed transformer (TD-TF), a simplified transformer architecture for data-driven modeling of unsteady spatio-temporal dynamics. TD-TF bridges linear operator-based methods and deep sequence models by showing that a single-layer, single-head transformer can be interpreted as a nonlinear generalization of time-delayed dynamic mode decomposition (TD-DMD). The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics. Validation studies on synthetic signals, unsteady aerodynamics, the Lorenz '63 system, and a reaction-diffusion model show that TD-TF preserves the interpretability and efficiency of linear models while providing substantially enhanced expressive power for complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiple ergodic averages along functions from a Hardy field: convergence, recurrence and combinatorial applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.03558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain new results pertaining to convergence and recurrence of multiple ergodic averages along functions from a Hardy field. Among other things, we confirm some of the conjectures posed by Frantzikinakis in [Fra10; Fra16] and obtain combinatorial applications which contain, as rather special cases, several previously known (polynomial and non-polynomial) extensions of Szemeredi's theorem on arithmetic progressions [BL96; BLL08; FW09; Fra10; BMR17]. One of the novel features of our results, which is not present in previous work, is that they allow for a mixture of polynomials and non-polynomial functions. As an illustration, assume $f_i(t)=a_{i,1}t^{c_{i,1}}+\cdots+a_{i,d}t^{c_{i,d}}$ for $c_{i,j}&gt;0$ and $a_{i,j}\in\mathbb{R}$. Then
  $\bullet$ for any measure preserving system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu,T)$ and $h_1,\dots,h_k\in L^\infty(X)$, the limit $$\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N T^{[f_1(n)]}h_1\cdots T^{[f_k(n)]}h_k$$ exists in $L^2$;
  $\bullet$ for any $E\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $\overline{\mathrm{d}}(E)&gt;0$ there are $a,n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $\{a,\, a+[f_1(n)],\ldots,a+[f_k(n)]\}\subset E$.
  We also show that if $f_1,\dots,f_k$ belong to a Hardy field, have polynomial growth, and are such that no linear combination of them is a polynomial, then for any measure preserving system $(X,{\mathcal B},\mu,T)$ and any $A\in{\mathcal B}$, $$\limsup_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N\mu\Big(A\cap T^{-[ f_1(n) ]}A\cap\ldots\cap T^{-[f_k(n)]}A\Big)\,\geq\,\mu(A)^{k+1}.$$</description>

Abstract: The main goal of the paper is to prove convergence in norm and pointwise almost everywhere on $L^p$, $p\in (1,\infty)$, for certain multiparameter polynomial ergodic averages in the spirit of Dunford and Zygmund for continuous flows. We will pay special attention to quantitative aspects of pointwise convergence phenomena from the point of view of uniform oscillation estimates for multiparameter polynomial Radon averaging operators. In the proof of our main result we develop flexible Fourier methods that exhibit and handle the so-called "parameters-gluing'' phenomenon, an obstruction that arises in studying oscillation and variation inequalities for multiparameter polynomial Radon operators. We will also discuss connections of our main result with a multiparameter variant of the Bellow-Furstenberg problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, for a $C^2$ partially hyperbolic endomorphism of the 2-torus which is strongly transitive, given an ergodic $u$-Gibbs measure that has positive center Lyapunov exponent and has full support, then either the map is special (has only one unstable direction per point), or the measure is the unique absolutely continuous invariant measure. We can apply this result in many settings, in particular obtaining uniqueness of $u$-Gibbs measures for every non-special perturbation of irreducible linear expanding maps of the torus with simple spectrum. This gives new open sets of partially hyperbolic systems displaying a unique $u$-Gibbs measure.</description>

Abstract: For transitive Markov subshifts over countable alphabets, this note ensures that a dense subclass of locally H\"older continuous potentials admits at most a single periodic probability as a maximizing measure. We resort to concepts analogous to those introduced by Mather and Ma\~n\'e in the study of globally minimizing curves in Lagrangian dynamics. In particular, given a summable variation potential, we show the existence of a continuous sub-action in the presence of an Aubry point.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the work of Katznelson and Ornstein, we present a short way to achieve the almost optimal regularity in Moser's twist theorem. Specifically, for an integrable area-preserving twist map, the invariant circle with a given constant type frequency $\alpha$ persists under a small perturbation (dependent on $\alpha$) of class $C^{3+\epsilon}$. This result was initially established independently by Herman and R\"{u}ssmann in 1983. Our method differs essentially from their approaches.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we construct an explicit counterexample of a smooth \(C^{\infty}\), periodic dynamical system on the torus \(\mathbb{T}^3\) for which the rotation vector exists in a weak sense, but fails to exist in the strong sense of bounded deviation (also referred to as {\it {frequencies}} in parts of the physics and biology literature). The construction exploits Liouville-type arithmetic properties and demonstrates that smoothness and periodicity alone do not ensure bounded deviation, even within the class of integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our work on the functional-analytic core of the classical Furstenberg-Zimmer theory. We introduce and study (in the framework of lattice-ordered spaces) the notions of total order-boundedness and uniform total order-boundedness. Either one generalizes the concept of ordinary precompactness known from metric space theory. These new notions are then used to define and characterize "compact extensions" of general measure-preserving systems (with no restrictions on the underlying probability spaces nor on the acting groups). In particular, it is (re)proved that compact extensions and extensions with discrete spectrum are one and the same thing. Finally, we show that under natural hypotheses a subset of a Kaplansky-Banach module is totally order bounded if and only if it is cyclically compact (in the sense of Kusraev).</description>

      <title>Distribution of bounded real sequences and a question of Astorg and Boc Thaler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astorg and Boc Thaler studied the dynamics of certain skew-product $f(z,w)=(p(z),q(z,w))$ tangent to the identity, with two real parameters $\alpha&gt;1$ and $\beta$ derived from its coefficients. They proved that if there exists an increasing sequence of positive integers $(n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ such that $(\sigma_k)_{k\geqslant 1}:=(n_{k+1}-\alpha n_k-\beta\ln n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ converges, then $f$ admits wandering domains of rank one. They also proved that for $\alpha&gt;1$ with the Pisot property, the condition that $\theta:=\frac{\beta\ln\alpha}{\alpha-1}$ is rational is sufficient for the existence of $(n_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ such that $(\sigma_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ converges to a cycle. They asked if this condition is necessary.
  When $\alpha$ is an algebraic number, we answer the question of Astorg and Boc Thaler in the affirmative: the condition that $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ is necessary and sufficient for the convergence of $(\sigma_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$ to a cycle. Furthermore, denoting by $P(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ the minimal polynomial of $\alpha$, we prove that $\theta\in\frac{1}{P(1)}\mathbb{Z}$ is necessary and sufficient for the convergence of $(\sigma_k)_{k\geqslant 1}$. Combined with the work of Astorg and Boc Thaler, our result provides explicit new examples of polynomial skew-products in $\mathbb{C}^2$ with wandering domains of rank one. We also prove related results on the distribution modulo one of linear recurrent sequences, generalizing theorems of Dubickas.</description>

      <title>On System Operators with Variation Bounding Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The property of linear discrete-time time-invariant system operators mapping inputs with at most $k-1$ sign changes to outputs with at most $k-1$ sign changes is investigated. We show that this property is tractable via the notion of $k$-sign consistency in case of the observability/controllability operator, which as such can also be used as a sufficient condition for the Hankel operator. Our results complement the mathematical literature by providing an algebraic characterization, independent of rank and dimension for variation bounding and diminishing matrices as well as by discussing their computational tractability. Based on these, we conduct our studies of variation bounding system operators beyond existing studies on order-preserving $k$-variation diminishment. Our findings are applied to the open problem of bounding the number of sign changes in a system's impulse response, which appears, e.g., when bounding the number of over- and undershoots in a step response or the number of bangs in bounded optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Extreme vulnerability to intruder attacks destabilizes network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consensus, synchronization, formation control, and power grid balance are all examples of virtuous dynamical states that may arise in networks. Here, we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial connections to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-degree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems, such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the Internet of Things, with implications that extend also to the realm of complex social and biological networks.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Periodic Monotonicity Preserving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two nested classes of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, which differ by the set of periodic signals that they leave invariant, are studied. The first class preserves the property of periodic monotonicity (period-wise unimodality). The second class is invariant to signals with at most two sign changes per period, and requires that periodic signals with zero sign changes are mapped to the same kind. Tractable characterizations for each system class are derived by the use and extension of total positivity theory via geometric interpretations. Central to our results is the characterization of sequentially convex contours via consecutive minors.
  Our characterizations also extend to the loop gain of Lur'e feedback systems as the considered signals sets are invariant under common static non-linearities, e.g., ideal relay, saturation, sigmoid function, quantizer, etc. The presented developments aim to form a base for future signal-based fixed-point theorems towards the prediction of self-sustained oscillations. Our examples on relay feedback systems indicate how periodic monotonicity preservation gives rise to useful insights towards this goal.</description>

      <title>Sums and products in sets of positive density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic approach that draws on tools from Fourier analysis and ergodic theory to study Ramsey-type problems involving sums and products in the integers. Suppose $Q$ denotes a polynomial with integer coefficients. We establish two main results. First, we show that if $Q(1) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive upper logarithmic density contains a pair of the form $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N} \setminus \{1\}$. Second, we prove that if $Q(0) = 0$, then any set of natural numbers with positive density relative to a new multiplicative notion of density, which arises naturally in the context of such problems, contains $\{x + Q(y), xy\}$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Twisted Diophantine approximation on manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In twisted Diophantine approximation, for a fixed $m\times n$ matrix $\boldsymbol\alpha$ one is interested in sets of vectors $\boldsymbol\beta\in\mathbb R^m$ such that the system of affine forms $\mathbb R^n \ni \mathbf q \mapsto \boldsymbol\alpha\mathbf q + \boldsymbol\beta \in \mathbb R^m$ satisfies some given Diophantine condition. In this paper we introduce the notion of manifolds which are of $\boldsymbol\alpha$-twisted Khintchine type for convergence or divergence. We provide sufficient conditions under which nondegenerate analytic manifolds exhibit this twisted Khintchine-type behaviour. Furthermore, we investigate the intersection properties of the sets of $\boldsymbol\alpha$-twisted badly approximable and well approximable vectors with nondegenerate manifolds.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) and DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) recast sequential evaluation as a parallelizable optimization problem, sometimes yielding dramatic speedups. However, the factors governing the difficulty of these optimization problems remained unclear, limiting broader adoption. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between a system's dynamics and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization problem, as measured by its Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) constant. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior and quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. For predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in at worst $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length: a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that predictable systems always yield well-conditioned optimization problems, whereas unpredictable systems lead to severe conditioning degradation. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized. We highlight predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>

      <title>Fractal closures of geodesic planes in Hitchin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem implies topological rigidity of immersed totally geodesic subspaces of noncompact type in finite-volume locally symmetric spaces. In higher rank and infinite volume, however, counterexamples to this rigidity have remained elusive.
  We construct the first such examples using {\em floating geodesic planes}. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that the Hitchin manifold $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains immersed floating geodesic planes whose closures are fractal, with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions accumulating at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  The construction uses Goldman's bulging deformations and exploits geometric features specific to higher rank. In contrast to rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane diverge uniformly, floating planes interact through higher-dimensional flats, requiring control of nearest point projections and a delicate analysis of Hausdorff dimension both at the group level and in the ambient symmetric space, where $\Gamma$-translates may intersect.</description>

      <title>RNNs perform task computations by dynamically warping neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysing how neural networks represent data features in their activations can help interpret how they perform tasks. Hence, a long line of work has focused on mathematically characterising the geometry of such "neural representations." In parallel, machine learning has seen a surge of interest in understanding how dynamical systems perform computations on time-varying input data. Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling through Koopman Spectral Analysis: An Operator-Theoretic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Koopman Spectral Wasserstein Gradient Descent (KSWGD), a particle-based generative modeling framework that learns the Langevin generator via Koopman theory and integrates it with Wasserstein gradient descent. Our key insight is that this spectral structure of the underlying distribution can be directly estimated from trajectory data via the Koopman operator, eliminating the need for explicit knowledge of the target potential. Additionally, we prove that KSWGD maintains an approximately constant dissipation rate, thereby establishing linear convergence and overcoming the vanishing-gradient phenomenon that hinders existing kernel-based particle methods. We further provide a Feynman--Kac interpretation that clarifies the method's probabilistic foundation. Experiments on compact manifolds, metastable multi-well systems, and high-dimensional stochastic partial differential equations demonstrate that KSWGD consistently outperforms baselines in both convergence speed and sample quality.</description>
