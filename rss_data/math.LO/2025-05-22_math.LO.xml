      <title>Graphings of arithmetical equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies when an arithmetical equivalence relation $E$ can be realized as the connectedness relation of a graph $G$ which is simpler to define than $E$. Several examples of such equivalence relations are established. In particular, it is proved that the $\Sigma^0_3$ relation of computable isomorphism of structures on $\N$ in a computable first-order language is $\Pi^0_2$-graphable, i.e., is the connectedness relation of a $\Pi^0_2$ graph. Graphings of Friedman-Stanley jumps are studied, including an arithmetical construction of a graphing of the Friedman-Stanley jump of $E$ from a graphing of $E$.</description>

      <title>Looking for stabilizers in NSOP$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study some examples of groups definable and type-definable in NSOP$_1$ theories. We exhibit some behaviors of these groups that differ from the ones of simple groups. We take interest in the notions of generics and stabilizers, and define the Kim-stabilizer. We apply the notion of Kim-stabilizer and the stabilizer from Hrushovsky to the context of a group $G$ definable in an NSOP$_1$ field $F$ satisfying some assumptions to show that there is a finite to one embedding of a type definable subgroup of $G$ of bounded index into an algebraic group over $F$. We then show that definable groups in omega-free PAC fields satisfy these conditions.</description>

      <title>Model-theoretic characterizations of large cardinals (Re)${}^2$visited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize several large cardinal notions by model-theoretic properties of extensions of first-order logic. We show that $\Pi_n$-strong cardinals, and, as a corollary, ``Ord is Woodin" and weak Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, are characterized by compactness properties involving Henkin models for sort logic. This provides a model-theoretic analogy between Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and weak Vop\v{e}nka's Principle. We also characterize huge cardinals by compactness for type omission properties of the well-foundedness logic $\mathbb L(Q^{\text{WF}})$, and show that the compactness number of the H\"artig quantifier logic $\mathbb L(I)$ can consistently be larger than the first supercompact cardinal. Finally, we show that the upward L\"owenheim-Skolem-Tarski number of second-order logic $\mathbb L^2$ and the sort logic $\mathbb L^{s,n}$ are given by the first extendible and $C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal, respectively.</description>

      <title>Extensions of categoricity relative to a degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the machinery developed in arXiv:2401.06641(2) to study the behavior of computable categoricity relativized to non-c.e. degrees. In particular, we show that we can build a computable structure which is not computably categorical but is computably categorical relative to a $1$-generic degree. Additionally, we show that other classes of structures besides directed graphs admit a computable example which can change its computable categorical behavior relative to different degrees.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the iterative CHAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatory Homomorphic Automatic Differentiation (CHAD) was originally formulated as a semantics-driven source transformation for reverse-mode AD in total programming languages. We extend this framework to partial languages with features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics. Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax, showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives. Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types, partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique.</description>

      <title>Fine structure from normal iterability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10037v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that (i) the standard fine structural properties for premice follow from normal iterability (whereas the classical proof relies on iterability for stacks of normal trees), and (ii) every mouse which is finitely generated above its projectum, is an iterate of its core.
  That is, let $m$ be an integer and let $M$ be an $m$-sound, $(m,\omega_1+1)$-iterable premouse. Then (i) $M$ is $(m+1)$-solid and $(m+1)$-universal, $(m+1)$ condensation holds for $M$, and if $m\geq 1$ then $M$ is super-Dodd-sound, a slight strengthening of Dodd-soundness. And (ii) if there is $x\in M$ such that $M$ is the $\mathrm{r}\Sigma_{m+1}$-hull of parameters in $\rho_{m+1}^M\cup\{x\}$, then $M$ is a normal iterate of its $(m+1)$-core $C=\mathfrak{C}_{m+1}(M)$; in fact, there is an $m$-maximal iteration tree $\mathcal{T}$ on $C$, of finite length, such that $M=M^{\mathcal{T}}_\infty$, and $i^{\mathcal{T}}_{0\infty}$ is just the core embedding.
  Applying fact (ii), we prove that if $M\models\mathrm{ZFC}$ is a mouse and $W\subseteq M$ is a ground of $M$ via a strategically $\sigma$-closed forcing $\mathbb{P}\in W$, and if $M|\aleph_1^M\in W$ (that is, the initial segment of $M$ of height $\aleph_1^M$ is in $W$), then the forcing is trivial; that is, $M\subseteq W$.
  And if there is a measurable cardinal, then there is a non-solid premouse.
  The results hold for premice with Mitchell-Steel indexing, allowing extenders of superstrong type to appear on the extender sequence.</description>

      <title>Weak compactness cardinals for strong logics and subtlety properties of the class of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work of Boney, Dimopoulos, Gitman and Magidor, we characterize the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics through combinatorial properties of the class of ordinals. This analysis is then used to show that, in contrast to the existence of strong compactness cardinals, the existence of weak compactness cardinals for abstract logics does not imply the existence of a strongly inaccessible cardinal. More precisely, it is proven that the existence of a proper class of subtle cardinals is consistent with the axioms of ZFC if and only if it is not possible to derive the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals from the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics. Complementing this result, it is shown that the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics implies that unboundedly many ordinals are strongly inaccessible in the inner model HOD of all hereditarily ordinal definable sets.</description>

      <title>Logic and Concepts in the 2-category of Topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Kan injectivity to axiomatise concepts in the 2-category of topoi. We showcase the expressivity of this language through many examples, and we establish some aspects of the formal theory of Kan extension in this 2-category (pointwise Kan extensions, fully faithful morphisms, etc.). We use this technology to introduce fragments of geometric logic, and we accommodate essentially algebraic, disjunctive, regular, and coherent logic in our framework, together with some more exotic examples. We show that each fragment $\mathcal{H}$ in our sense identifies a lax-idempotent (relative) pseudomonad $\mathsf{T}^{\mathcal{H}}$ on $\mathsf{lex}$, the $2$-category of finitely complete categories. We show that the algebras for $\mathsf{T}^{\mathcal{H}}$ admit a notion of classifying topos, for which we deliver several Diaconescu-type results. The construction of classifying topoi allows us to define conceptually complete fragments of geometric logic.</description>

      <title>Being polite is not enough (and other limits of theory combination)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Nelson-Oppen combination method for satisfiability modulo theories, the combined theories must be stably infinite; in gentle combination, one theory has to be gentle, and the other has to satisfy a similar yet weaker property; in shiny combination, only one has to be shiny (smooth, with a computable minimal model function and the finite model property); and for polite combination, only one has to be strongly polite (smooth and strongly finitely witnessable). For each combination method, we prove that if any of its assumptions are removed, then there is no general method to combine an arbitrary pair of theories satisfying the remaining assumptions. We also prove new theory combination results that weaken the assumptions of gentle and shiny combination.</description>
