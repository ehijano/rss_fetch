      <title>Observables in Motion: A guide to simulating classical and quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical work-in-progress. This textbook aims to introduce Hilbert space representations for quantum and classical dynamics, outlining the mathematical foundations, practical guidance, and Python implementation of dynamical simulations. Beginning with a historical survey, the book systematically develops the mathematical foundations, kinematic descriptions, and formal evolution theory needed to understand both classical and quantum systems. It then provides practical guidance for numerically simulating time-dependent Schr\"odinger evolution, classical dynamics through symplectic integrators, and open quantum systems including phase-space formulations and stochastic unravellings.</description>

      <title>Symmetrized operators or modified integration measure in Generalized Uncertainty Principle Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models modify the inner-product measure to ensure symmetric position or momentum operators. We show that an alternate approach to these GUPs is to symmetrize the operators rather than modifying the inner product. This preserves the standard momentum space allowing the eigenstates and maximally localized states of the modified position operator to have a standard position representation. We compare both approaches and highlight their merits.</description>

      <title>Computational Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.</description>

      <title>Quantum non-Gaussianity based on amplified photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplification is an essential part of quantum processing and detection that allows for reducing subsequent loss and noise. However, the intensive amplification transfers individual discrete quanta to a detected continuous signal, so Fock probabilities of the unknown input state are not readily available. To solve this issue, we directly derive and analyze a quantum non-Gaussianity witness based on the photon number mean and variance (or alternatively, the second-order correlation $g^{(2)}$) of the unknown state, which can be inferred from post-amplification integrated intensity moments. Since this new witness is based on first and second moments only, measurement results are easy to correct for losses and additive noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistical mechanical gauge invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address gauge invariance in the statistical mechanics of quantum many-body systems. The gauge transformation acts on the position and momentum degrees of freedom and it is represented by a quantum shifting superoperator that maps quantum observables onto each other. The shifting superoperator is anti-self-adjoint and it has noncommutative Lie algebra structure. These properties induce exact equilibrium sum rules that connect locally-resolved force and hyperforce densities for any given observable. We demonstrate the integration of the framework within quantum hyperdensity functional theory and show that it generalizes naturally to nonequilibrium.</description>

      <title>Towards a user-centric HPC-QC environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust execution environments are important for addressing key challenges in quantum computing, such as application development, portability, and reproducibility, and help unlock the development of modular quantum programs, driving forward hybrid quantum workflows. In this work, we show progress towards a basic, but portable, runtime environment for developing and executing hybrid quantum-classical programs running in High Performance Computing (HPC) environments enhanced with Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). The middleware includes a second layer of scheduling after the main HPC resource manager in order to improve the utilization of the QPU, and extra functionality for observability, monitoring, and admin access. This approach enables managing multiple programming Software Development Kits (SDKs) as first-class citizens in the environment by building on a recently proposed vendor-neutral Quantum Resource Management Interface (QRMI). Lastly, we discuss and show a solution for the monitoring and observability stack, completing our description of the hybrid system architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction beyond $SU(2)$ spin, bosonic, and permutation-invariant codes from convex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for constructing quantum error-correcting codes and logical gates for three types of spaces -- composite permutation-invariant spaces of many qubits or qudits, composite constant-excitation Fock-state spaces of many bosonic modes, and monolithic nuclear state spaces of atoms, ions, and molecules. By identifying all three spaces with discrete simplices and representations of the Lie group $SU(q)$, we prove that many codes and their gates in $SU(q)$ can be inter-converted between the three state spaces. We construct new code instances for all three spaces using classical $\ell_1$ codes and Tverberg's theorem, a classic result from convex geometry. We obtain new families of quantum codes with distance that scales almost linearly with the code length $N$ by constructing $\ell_1$ codes based on combinatorial patterns called Sidon sets and utilizing their Tverberg partitions. This improves upon the existing designs for all the state spaces. We present explicit constructions of codes with shorter length or lower total spin/excitation than known codes with similar parameters, new bosonic codes with exotic Gaussian gates, as well as examples of short codes with distance larger than the known constructions.</description>

      <title>Realization of Graphene Quantum Dots for Innovative Biosensor Development and Diverse Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum dots (QDs), which are miniature semiconductor structures with remarkable optical and electrical properties due to quantum confinement processes. Traditional QDs, such as CdTe, have been extensively investigated; however, they frequently exhibit toxicity and stability issues. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are emerging as a safer and more stable alternative to traditional QDs. GQDs are honeycomb-lattice carbon atoms with unique electronic and optical properties that make them promising candidates for biomedical, electronic, and energy storage applications. GQD synthesis methods (top-down and bottom-up) and their advantages over standard QDs include better photostability, biocompatibility, and configurable band gaps. GQDs are perfect for real-world uses like sensitive biosensing, real-time food safety monitoring, and smart packaging because of their low toxicity, high sensitivity, and affordability. These uses are all essential for cutting down on food grain waste. This emphasizes the growing significance of GQDs in advancing nanotechnology and their potential integration with quantum technologies, paving the door for creative solutions in biosensing, food safety, environmental monitoring, and future quantum electronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Magic Generation and Information Scrambling in Noisy Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the average information scrambling and nonlocal magic generation properties of random Clifford encoding-decoding circuits perturbed by local noise. We quantify these with the bipartite algebraic out-of-time order correlator ($\mathcal{A}$-OTOC) and average Pauli-entangling power (APEP) respectively. Using recent advances in the representation theory of the Clifford group, we compute both quantities' averages in the limit that the circuits become infinitely large. We observe that both display a ``butterfly effect" whereby noise occurring on finitely many qubits leads to macroscopic information scrambling and nonlocal magic generating power. Finally, we numerically study the relationship between the magic capacity, an operator-level magic monotone, of the noise channel and the APEP of the resulting circuit, which may provide insight for designing efficient nonlocal magic factories.</description>

      <title>Excited-CAFQA: A classical simulation bootstrap for the variational estimation of molecular excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are iterative algorithms suited to implementation on current-era quantum devices. VQAs employ classical optimization to minimize cost functions evaluated on quantum circuits. However, the extent to which VQAs manage noise is often insufficient for quantum chemistry applications. One method of improving VQAs is through accurate ansatz initialization. The CAFQA (Clifford Ansatz For Quantum Accuracy) protocol runs a discrete search through a classically simulatable subset of the entire state space to find a desirable initialization. Prior work has evaluated CAFQA applied to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a VQA that computes grounds states of a Hamiltonian. Motivated by CAFQA's success, we propose Excited-CAFQA initialization for Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), a quantum algorithm that extends VQE by allowing the computation of excited states. VQD recursively computes excited states, by constraining the kth state to be orthogonal to the previous k-1 computed energy states via a penalty term appended to the standard VQE cost function. Just as with VQE, the VQD cost function can be efficiently computed classically for the states considered in the discrete CAFQA search, allowing for the discrete CAFQA optimizer to find good initial parameters for each energy level computation. Preliminary evaluation shows that Excited-CAFQA achieves 90 to 99+% accuracy across a variety of bond lengths and excited states for H2 and HeH+ molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal unitary estimation in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ by the analysis of graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary estimation is the task to estimate an unknown unitary operator $U\in\mathrm{SU}(d)$ with $n$ queries to the corresponding unitary operation, and its accuracy is evaluated by an estimation fidelity. We show that the optimal asymptotic fidelity of $3$-dimensional unitary estimation is given by $F_\mathrm{est}(n,d=3) = 1-\frac{56\pi^2}{9n^2} + O(n^{-3})$ by the analysis of the graph Laplacian based on the finite element method. We also show the lower bound on the fidelity of $d$-dimensional unitary estimation for an arbitrary $d$ given by $F_\mathrm{est}(n,d) \geq 1- \frac{(d+1)(d-1)(3d-2)(3d-1)}{6n^2} + O(n^{-3})$ achieving the best known lower bound and tight scaling with respect to $n$ and $d$. This lower bound is derived based on the unitary estimation protocol shown in [J. Kahn, Phys. Rev. A 75, 022326, 2007].</description>

      <title>Optimal phase change for a generalized Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalized Grover's algorithm with an arbitrary amplitude vector to find the optimal phase change for maximizing the gain in probability for the target of each iteration. In the classic setting of Grover's algorithm with a real initial amplitude vector, we find that a phase change of $\pi$ stays optimal until the probability of observing the target is quite close to 1. We provide a formula for identifying this cut-off point based on the size of the data set. When the amplitude is truly complex, we find that the optimal phase change depends non-trivially on the complexity of the amplitude vector. We provide an optimization formula to identify the required optimal phase change.</description>

      <title>Probing Bandwidth and Sensitivity in Rydberg Atom Sensing via Optical Homodyne and RF Heterodyne Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom based sensors allow for SI traceable measurements and show promise for applications in the field of communication and radar technologies. In this article, we investigate the bandwidth and sensitivity of a Rydberg atom-based sensor in a rubidium vapor cell using Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy. We employ a radio-frequency (RF) heterodyne measurement technique in combination with an optical homodyne setup to extend the achievable range between sensitivity and bandwidth in a Rydberg sensor. While the bandwidth of Rydberg sensors are limited by the transit time of atoms and the Rabi frequency of the coupling field, achieving higher bandwidth through smaller beam sizes is thought to compromise sensitivity due to reduced EIT signal strength. Using optical homodyne detection, we demonstrate that sensitivity is preserved while achieving a response bandwidth of 8 MHz. In addition, using the Rydberg sensor, we receive digital communication signals and present error vector magnitude (EVM) measurements as a function of varying symbol rates and bandwidth of the Rydberg sensor. Furthermore, the sensor's performance is compared with a conventional RF mixer. We establish that the bandwidth of a Rydberg sensor when receiving a pure tone is not the same as the bandwidth of the sensor when receiving a modulated signal. This difference results from the spreading of symbols in the frequency domain, leading to a reduction of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and an accumulation of noise over the total span of the modulated signal.</description>

      <title>A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization.
  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Learning Hamiltonians from Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning Hamiltonians from time evolution: given the ability to apply $e^{-iHt}$ for an unknown Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits, the goal is to recover the parameters of $H$. This is a well-studied problem in quantum learning theory, with applications to quantum metrology, sensing, device benchmarking, and many-body physics. For this problem, we demonstrate the first lower bounds which scale with the number of parameters of the unknown Hamiltonian. When the unknown Hamiltonian is arbitrary, we show that learning to error $\epsilon$ requires $2^{(1/2 - o(1))n} / \epsilon$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian. If the Hamiltonian is additionally assumed to be $k$-local, we show that learning to constant error requires $n^{\Omega (k)}$ rounds of interaction with the Hamiltonian, resolving an open question of Tang. These bounds immediately imply that any learning algorithm with inverse polynomial time resolution requires super-polynomial total evolution time. Our lower bounds hold even for very simple planted spike detection problems, where the goal is to detect the presence of a single coefficient which is super-polynomially larger than the other coefficients of the Hamiltonian, as well as for average case instances.</description>

Abstract: Computational modeling of cellular systems, where reactants are governed by biochemical equations and physical representations, requires extensive classical computing resources. These limitations significantly constrain the system size and spatiotemporal scales of simulations. A key challenge lies in the "curse of dimensionality", where the number of possible reaction terms grows exponentially with the number of species, and the computation of reaction rates involving many-body interactions becomes intractable in polynomial time on classical computers. In this work, we introduce a quantum algorithmic framework designed to overcome these challenges, leveraging the architecture of quantum computing to simultaneously compute reaction rates and track the spatiotemporal dynamical evolutions of subcellular systems. We generalize the reaction-diffusion equation (RDE) for multiscale systems with arbitrary species count, encompassing higher-order interactions. Our approach achieves two principal quantum advantages: (i) an exponential quantum speedup in reaction-rate computation, contingent on the efficient preparation of polynomially accurate ground states on a quantum computer, and (ii)) a quadratic scaling in spatial grid points and polynomial scaling in the number of species for solving nonlinear RDEs, contrasting sharply with classical methods that scale exponentially with the system's degrees of freedom. To our knowledge, this represents the first efficient quantum algorithm for solving multiscale reaction-diffusion systems. This framework opens the door to simulations of biologically relevant subcellular processes across previously inaccessible spatial and temporal scales, with profound implications for computational biology, soft matter physics, and biophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Complexity of Quantum Stabilizer Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random classical linear codes are widely believed to be hard to decode. While slightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes sufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential time. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical code at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a breakthrough in cryptography.
  More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and decision. We also demonstrate several ways in which quantum phenomena, such as quantum degeneracy, force several reasonable definitions of stabilizer decoding--all of which are classically identical--to have distinct or non-trivially equivalent complexity.</description>

      <title>PALQO: Physics-informed Model for Accelerating Large-scale Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are leading strategies to reach practical utilities of near-term quantum devices. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics precludes standard backpropagation, leading to prohibitive quantum resource costs when applying VQAs to large-scale tasks. To address this challenge, we reformulate the training dynamics of VQAs as a nonlinear partial differential equation and propose a novel protocol that leverages physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model this dynamical system efficiently. Given a small amount of training trajectory data collected from quantum devices, our protocol predicts the parameter updates of VQAs over multiple iterations on the classical side, dramatically reducing quantum resource costs. Through systematic numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 30x speedup compared to conventional methods and reduces quantum resource costs by as much as 90\% for tasks involving up to 40 qubits, including ground state preparation of different quantum systems, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach complements existing techniques aimed at improving the efficiency of VQAs and further strengthens their potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation and Energy Estimation for Discretized Anharmonic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anharmonic potential quantum system play crucial role in physics as they provide a more realistic description of oscillatory phenomena, which often deviate from the idealized harmonic model. However, simulating such system on classical computers is highly challenging due to nonlinear interactions, large state spaces, and the exponential scaling of memory and computational resources. In this work, quantum simulation is employed to model a quantum anharmonic oscillator (QAHO) using a 3-qubit system implemented on IBM's Quantum Experiences platform. A quantum circuit with a filter-based design and Toffoli gates is constructed to track quantum state evolution, capturing key phenomena like quantum revival. The framework is further extended to n-qubit system to enhance resolution and scalability. For energy estimation, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with a TwoLocal ansatz and variational Quantum Deflation (VQD), are used to compute ground and excited state energies. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy with an error of only 1.11% compared to exact methods. Notably, VQE outperforms classical approximations such as perturbation theory (error 6.71%) and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation(error 5.36%), yielding more precise energy values. These results highlight the potential of quantum simulation and VQD as effective tools for investigating complex quantum system, paving the way for future application in quantum chemistry and materials science as quantum hardware continues to advance.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaotic synchronization in coupled dissipative time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of two coherently coupled dissipative time crystals. In the classical mean-field limit of infinite spin length, we identify a regime of chaotic synchronization, marked by a positive largest Lyapunov exponent and a Pearson correlation coefficient close to one. At the boundary of this regime, the Pearson coefficient varies abruptly, marking a crossover between staggered and uniform $z$-magnetization. To address finite-size quantum dynamics, we employ a quantum-trajectory approach and study the trajectory-resolved expectations of subsystem $z$-magnetizations. Their histograms over time and trajectory realizations exhibit maxima that undergo a staggered-to-uniform crossover analogous to the classical one. In analogy with the classical case, we interpret this behavior as quantum chaotic synchronization, with dissipative quantum chaos evidenced by the steady-state density matrix exhibiting Gaussian Unitary Ensemble statistics. The locations of the classical and quantum crossover differ, reflecting the noncommutativity of the infinite-spin and infinite-time limits and the impact of entanglement, quantified via the entanglement entropy between subsystems.</description>

      <title>Distillation of supersinglet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement distillation (purification) protocol for supersinglet states composed of N qubits. The supersinglet state we target is a total spin zero state with zero spin variance, and has a fully entangled structure involving all qubits. In our distillation protocol, three copies of an initial spin zero state are measured in the local total spin basis such that a higher fidelity supersinglet state is generated upon postselection. The initial state can be prepared using conventional Bell state distillation methods distributed in a way to target the supersinglet symmetries. The protocol uses only local operations and classical communications, and is suitable for long-distance applications such as quantum clock synchronization and cryptography, and avoids a high dimensional Schur transform such that it can be used for tasks such as quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Harnessing optical disorder for Bell inequalities violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequalities are a cornerstone of quantum physics. By carefully selecting measurement bases (typically polarization), their violation certifies quantum entanglement. Such measurements are disrupted by the presence of optical disorder in propagation paths, including polarization or spatial mode mixing in fibers and through free-space turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that disorder can instead be exploited as a resource to certify entanglement via a Bell inequality test. In our experiment, one photon of a polarization-entangled pair propagates through a commercial multimode fiber that scrambles spatial and polarization modes, producing a speckle pattern, while the other photon remains with the sender. By spatially resolving the speckle intensity pattern, we naturally access a large set of random and unknown polarization projections. We show that this set is statistically sufficient to violate a Bell inequality, thereby certifying entanglement without requiring active correction techniques. Our approach provides a fundamentally new way to test Bell inequalities, eliminating the need for an explicit choice of measurement basis, and offering a practical solution for entanglement certification in real-world quantum communication channels where disorder is unavoidable.</description>

      <title>No Universal Purification in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the linearity and positivity of quantum mechanics impose general restrictions on quantum purification, unveiling a new fundamental limitation of quantum information processing. In particular, no quantum operation can transform a finite number of copies of an unknown quantum state or channel into a pure state or channel that depends on the input, thereby ruling out an important form of universal purification in both static and dynamical settings. Relaxing the requirement of exact pure output, we further extend our result to establish quantitative sample complexity bounds for approximate purification, independent of any task details or operational constraints. To illustrate the practical consequences of this principle, we examine the task of approximately preparing pure dilation and, for the first time, prove an exponential lower bound on the required sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Limits to black-box amplification in QMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limitations of black-box amplification in the quantum complexity class QMA. Amplification is known to boost any inverse-polynomial gap between completeness and soundness to exponentially small error, and a recent result (Jeffery and Witteveen, 2025) shows that completeness can in fact be amplified to be doubly exponentially close to 1. We prove that this is optimal for black-box procedures: we provide a quantum oracle relative to which no QMA verification procedure using polynomial resources can achieve completeness closer to 1 than doubly exponential, or a soundness which is super-exponentially small. This is proven by using techniques from complex approximation theory, to make the oracle separation from (Aaronson, 2008), between QMA and QMA with perfect completeness, quantitative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian states, described by Wigner quasi-probability distribution taking negative values, are of great interest for various applications of quantum physics. It is known however that they are highly vulnerable to dissipation. In this paper, we show that the robustness of the non-Gaussian states to losses can be significantly improved by pre-squeezing of the quantum state, and find the optimal parameters of the squeezing. As specific examples, we consider such well-known quantum states as Schrodinger cat, Fock , and ``banana'' ones.</description>

      <title>Radiation of "breathing" vortex electron packets in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a vortex electron with an orbital angular momentum (OAM) enters a magnetic field, its quantum state is described with a nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) state rather than with a stationary Landau state. A key feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's root-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations. Classically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit photons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM, leading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve Maxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an electron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the angular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex electron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic field. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be negligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a prominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and other charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a key step in quantum information, both theoretically and practically. It has been proven that non-positive-partial transpose (NPT) entangled states of rank at most four is 1-distillable under local operation and classical communications. In this paper we investigate the distillation of a more complex family of NPT entangled states, namely a family of symmetric two-qutrit states $\r$ of rank five with given eigenvectors. We explicitly construct five families of such states by requiring four of the five eigenvalues to be the same. We respectively show that some of them are 1-distillable. It turns out that such states may be not 1-distillable for some interval of eigenvalues. We provide some conditions for eigenvalues that allow $\r$ to be 1-distillable or to be 1-undistillable.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Measurements: Computational Max- and Measured R\'enyi Divergences and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information processing is limited, in practice, to efficiently implementable operations. This motivates the study of quantum divergences that preserve their operational meaning while faithfully capturing these computational constraints. Using geometric, computational, and information theoretic tools, we define two new types of computational divergences, which we term computational max-divergence and computational measured R\'enyi divergences. Both are constrained by a family of efficient binary measurements, and thus useful for state discrimination tasks in the computational setting. We prove that, in the infinite-order limit, the computational measured R\'enyi divergence coincides with the computational max-divergence, mirroring the corresponding relation in the unconstrained information-theoretic setting. For the many-copy regime, we introduce regularized versions and establish a one-sided computational Stein bound on achievable hypothesis-testing exponents under efficient measurements, giving the regularized computational measured relative entropy an operational meaning. We further define resource measures induced by our computational divergences and prove an asymptotic continuity bound for the computational measured relative entropy of resource. Focusing on entanglement, we relate our results to previously proposed computational entanglement measures and provide explicit separations from the information-theoretic setting. Together, these results provide a principled, cohesive approach towards state discrimination tasks and resource quantification under computational constraints.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore (2+1)D quantum electrodynamics (QED) at finite density on a quantum computer, including two fermion flavors. Our method employs an efficient gauge-invariant ansatz together with a quantum circuit structure that enforces Gauss's law. As a proof of principle, we benchmark our simulation protocol on a small lattice system, demonstrating the identification of phase transitions in terms of the particle number of the fermion flavors. Classical simulations are used to obtain optimized variational parameters, which are then deployed in inference runs on IBM quantum hardware. We conclude by discussing hardware limitations and prospects for scaling this method to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Numerically exact quantum dynamics with tensor networks: Predicting the decoherence of interacting spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the quantum dynamics of promising solid-state and molecular quantum technology candidates remains a formidable challenge. Yet, accessing these dynamics is key to understanding and controlling decoherence mechanisms -- a prerequisite for designing better qubits, sensors, and memories. We leverage a matrix product state representation to introduce a numerically exact and scalable method to achieve this goal. We demonstrate that our method accurately predicts coherence and population dynamics of spin networks across a wide range of parameter regimes, encompassing nuclear spin sensors and qubits in solid-state semiconductors and molecular magnets. Our method further predicts spin dynamics under the influence of repeated light pulses, which are commonly used to mitigate decoherence and perform quantum sensing experiments. Our method thus provides reliable results for moderately-sized spin platforms spanning molecular magnets and solid-state spins that can guide the development of approximate but efficient quantum dynamics methods and enable principled inquiry into decoherence mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report accurate quantum simulations of medium-mass atomic nuclei -including oxygen, calcium, and nickel- on the RIKEN-Quantinuum Reimei trapped-ion quantum computer, achieving sub-percent accuracy. Using a symmetry-aware pair-unitary coupled-cluster doubles (pUCCD) ansatz implemented with a hard-core-boson mapping, and with particle-number-restoring post-selection, our ground-state energy estimates agree with noise-free statevector simulations and with exact diagonalization results on the order of 0.1% relative error. These experiments establish a new benchmark for quantum simulations of strongly correlated nuclear systems on real hardware and demonstrate the near-term potential of high-fidelity trapped-ion platforms for nuclear-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Squeezing codes: robust fluctuation-stabilized memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce families of classical stochastic dynamics in two and higher dimensions which stabilize order in the absence of any symmetry. Our dynamics are qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, and have the unusual feature of being fluctuation-stabilized: their order becomes increasingly fragile in larger dimensions. One of our models maintains an ordered phase only in two dimensions. The phase transitions that occur as the order is lost realize new dynamical universality classes which are fundamentally non-equilibrium in character.</description>

      <title>Teleportation-based filtering for gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the principle of quantum teleportation in gravitational-wave detectors provides a method to address technical challenges associated with implementing quantum filters for squeezed-light injection. A recent proposal has shown that an arbitrary number of effective squeezing-angle rotations can be achieved by cascading quantum teleportation, yielding sensitivity equivalent to frequency-dependent pre-filtering. A natural question is whether the teleportation-based protocol can also realize frequency-dependent post-filtering. In this work, we examine this possibility and show that, with perfect teleportation fidelity, post-filtering can be fully implemented. In practice, however, various imperfections make the sensitivity nearly equivalent to that of teleportation-based pre-filtering. We apply this scheme to the low-frequency detector in the Einstein Telescope xylophone configuration and find that teleportation-based post-filtering could also be a candidate for the detector's design.</description>

      <title>Tracking spin qubit frequency variations over 912 days</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state qubits are sensitive to their microscopic environment, causing the qubit properties to fluctuate on a wide range of timescales. The sub-Hz end of the spectrum is usually dealt with by repeated background calibrations, which bring considerable overhead. It is thus important to characterize and understand the low-frequency variations of the relevant qubit characteristics. In this study, we investigate the stability of spin qubit frequencies in the Si/SiGe quantum dot platform. We find that the calibrated qubit frequencies of a six-qubit device vary by up to $\pm 100$ MHz while performing a variety of experiments over a span of 912 days. These variations are sensitive to the precise voltage settings of the gate electrodes, however when these are kept constant to within 15 $\mathrm{\mu}$V, the qubit frequencies vary by less than $\pm 7$ MHz over periods up to 36 days. During overnight scans, the qubit frequencies of ten qubits across two different devices show a standard deviation below 200 kHz within a 1-hour time window. The qubit frequency noise spectral density shows roughly a $1/f$ trend above $10^{-4}$ Hz and, strikingly, a steeper trend at even lower frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Multicast for securely sharing confidential data among many users is becoming increasingly important. Currently, it relies on duplicate-and-forward routing and cryptographic methods based on computational security. However, these approaches neither attain multicast capacity of the network, nor ensure long-term security against advances in computing (information-theoretic security: ITS). Existing ITS solutions--quantum key distribution (QKD), physical layer security (PLS), and secure network coding (SNC)--still fail to enable scalable networks, as their underlying assumptions, such as trusted nodes and wiretap thresholds, gradually become invalid as the network grows. Here, we develop an efficient multi-tree multicast path-finding method to address this issue, integrating it with universal strongly ramp SNC. This system, path-controlled universal strongly ramp SNC (PUSNEC), can be overlaid onto QKD/PLS networks, enabling multicast capacity, ITS, and scalability. We derive the maximum leakage information to an eavesdropper under the probabilistic wiretap network assumption and demonstrate secure multicast in multi-hop networks through numerical simulations. Our quantitative analysis of the secrecyreliability tradeoff highlights a practical approach to achieving secure, reliable multicast on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Observation of Discrete Time Quasicrystal in Rydberg Atomic Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time quasicrystals (DTQC) constitute a class of non-equilibrium matter characterized by temporal order without strict periodicity, in contrast to conventional time crystals. Investigating these phenomena is essential for expanding our fundamental understanding of far-from-equilibrium quantum matter and spontaneous symmetry breaking beyond periodic regimes. Here, we experimentally observe a DTQC in a driven-dissipative ensemble of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms, displaying non-equilibrium dynamical response with a different finite Abelian group symmetry $\mathbb{Z}{_m} \times \mathbb{Z}{_n}$. By applying a quasi-periodic drive using a dual-frequency drive with incommensurate frequencies, we demonstrate that the system exhibits a robust subharmonic response at multiple incommensurate frequencies, signifying the emergence of a DTQC phase. We map the full phase diagram of the system, which includes the DTQC phase, and demonstrated its rigidity against perturbations in both RF field intensity and laser detuning. Moreover, we observe a cyclic group symmetry effect that constrains the construction of $\mathbb{Z}{_2} \times \mathbb{Z}{_3}$-symmetric DTQC. This work establishes a versatile platform for studying non-equilibrium phases of matter and provides insights into the dynamics of time-translation symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2006.06719v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum computing algorithm for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We use a normalization procedure to encode the SPH operators and domain discretization in a quantum register. We then perform the SPH summation via an inner product of quantum registers. Using a one-dimensional function, we test the approach in a classical sense for the kernel sum and first and second derivatives of a one-dimensional function, using both the Gaussian and Wendland kernel functions, and compare various register sizes against analytical results. Error convergence is exponentially fast in the number of qubits. We extend the method to solve the one-dimensional advection and diffusion partial differential equations, which are commonly encountered in fluids simulations. This work provides a foundation for a more general SPH algorithm, eventually leading to highly efficient simulations of complex engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14904v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, aerospace engineering, and the design of "green" materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.</description>

      <title>Information and majorization theory for fermionic phase-space distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward several information-theoretic measures for analyzing the uncertainty of fermionic phase-space distributions using the theory of supernumbers. In contrast to the bosonic case, the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables allows us to provide simple expressions for the Glauber $P$-, Wigner $W$-, and Husimi $Q$-distributions of the arbitrary state of a single fermionic mode. It appears that all physical states are Gaussian and, thus, can be described by positive or negative thermal distributions (over Grassmann variables). We then prove several fermionic uncertainty relations, including notably the fermionic analogs of the (yet unproven) phase-space majorization and Wigner entropy conjectures for a bosonic mode, as well as the Lieb-Solovej theorem and the Wehrl-Lieb inequality. Our central point is that, although fermionic phase-space distributions are Grassmann-valued and do not have a straightforward interpretation, the corresponding uncertainty measures are expressed as Berezin integrals, which take on real values and are physically relevant.</description>

      <title>Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound: How close can we get without entangling measurements?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-parameter quantum metrology, the resource of entanglement can lead to an increase in efficiency of the estimation process. Entanglement can be used in the state preparation stage, or the measurement stage, or both, to harness this advantage; here we focus on the role of entangling measurements. Specifically, entangling or collective measurements over multiple identical copies of a probe state are known to be superior to measuring each probe individually, but the extent of this improvement is an open problem. It is also known that such entangling measurements, though resource-intensive, are required to attain the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks. In this work we investigate the maximum precision improvement that collective quantum measurements can offer over individual measurements for estimating parameters of qudit states, calling this the 'collective quantum enhancement'. We show that, whereas the maximum enhancement can, in principle, be a factor of $n$ for estimating $n$ parameters, this bound is not tight for large $n$. Instead, our results prove an enhancement linear in dimension of the qudit is possible using collective measurements and lead us to conjecture that this is the maximum collective quantum enhancement in any local estimation scenario.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Learning Implies Circuit Lower Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish connections between state tomography, pseudorandomness, quantum state synthesis, and circuit lower bounds. In particular, let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a family of non-uniform quantum circuits of polynomial size and suppose that there exists an algorithm that, given copies of $|\psi \rangle$, distinguishes whether $|\psi \rangle$ is produced by $\mathfrak{C}$ or is Haar random, promised one of these is the case. For arbitrary fixed constant $c$, we show that if the algorithm uses at most $O(2^{n^c})$ time and $2^{n^{0.99}}$ samples then $\mathsf{stateBQE} \not\subset \mathsf{state}\mathfrak{C}$. Here $\mathsf{stateBQE} := \mathsf{stateBQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ and $\mathsf{state}\mathfrak{C}$ are state synthesis complexity classes as introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which capture problems with classical inputs but quantum output. Note that efficient tomography implies a similarly efficient distinguishing algorithm against Haar random states, even for nearly exponential-time algorithms. Because every state produced by a polynomial-size circuit can be learned with $2^{O(n)}$ samples and time, or $O(n^{\omega(1)})$ samples and $2^{O(n^{\omega(1)})}$ time, we show that even slightly non-trivial quantum state tomography algorithms would lead to new statements about quantum state synthesis. Finally, a slight modification of our proof shows that distinguishing algorithms for quantum states can imply circuit lower bounds for decision problems as well. This help sheds light on why time-efficient tomography algorithms for non-uniform quantum circuit classes has only had limited and partial progress. Our work parallels results by Arunachalam et al. (FOCS 2021) that revealed a similar connection between quantum learning of Boolean functions and circuit lower bounds for classical circuit classes, but modified for the purposes of state tomography and state synthesis.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum interference phenomenon in which four-photon quantum states generated by two independent sources are used to create a two-photon interference pattern without detecting two of the photons. Contrary to the common perception, the interference pattern can be made fully independent of phases acquired by the photons detected to construct it. However, it still contains information about spatially dependent phases acquired by the two undetected photons. This phenomenon can also be observed with fermionic particles. We show that the phenomenon can be applied to develop an interferometric, quantum phase imaging technique that is immune to uncontrollable phase fluctuations in the interferometer and allows image acquisition without detecting the photons illuminating the object.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating Pauli Checks for Expectation Value Estimation on Noisy Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pauli Check Sandwiching (PCS) is an error detection scheme that protects quantum circuits by inserting pairs of parity checks and discarding runs that signal errors. However, each additional check introduces noise and exponentially increases sampling costs. To address these limitations, we propose Pauli Check Extrapolation (PCE), an error mitigation technique that obtains measured expectation values from circuits with different numbers of checks and, analogous to ZNE, extrapolates to the ``maximum check'' limit -- the theoretical number of checks required for unit fidelity. We test linear and exponential ansatzes, deriving the exponential form from the Markovian error model. Benchmarking PCE against ZNE on random Clifford circuits with simulated depolarizing noise shows PCE outperforming ZNE for larger circuits. On real IBM hardware, PCE achieves an accuracy of up to 99.2% (56.2% improvement over baseline), compared to ZNE's 82% accuracy (29.1% improvement over baseline), for 4-qubit circuits. To demonstrate a practical use case, we then apply PCE towards mitigating errors in classical shadow measurements. Our results show that PCE can achieve fidelities greater than the state-of-the-art Robust Shadow estimation, while significantly reducing the number of required samples by eliminating the need for a calibration procedure. We validate these findings on both fully connected topologies and simulated IBM hardware backends.</description>

Abstract: The technological development of increasingly larger quantum processors on different quantum platforms raises the problem of how to fairly compare their performance, known as quantum benchmarking of quantum processors. This is a challenge that computer scientists have already faced when comparing classical processors, leading to the development of various mathematical tools to address it, but also to the identification of the limits of this problem. In this work, we briefly review the most important aspects of both classical processor benchmarks and the metrics comprising them, providing precise definitions and analyzing the quality attributes that they should exhibit. Subsequently, we analyze the intrinsic properties that characterize the paradigm of quantum computing and hinder the naive transfer of strategies from classical benchmarking. However, we can still leverage some of the lessons learned such as the quality attributes of a \textit{good} benchmark. Additionally, we review some of the most important metrics and benchmarks for quantum processors proposed in the literature, assessing what quality attributes they fulfill. Finally, we propose general guidelines for quantum benchmarking. These guidelines aim to pave the way for establishing a roadmap towards standardizing the performance evaluation of quantum devices, ultimately leading to the creation of an organization akin to the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC).</description>

      <title>Fractals and spontaneous symmetry breaking with type-B Goldstone modes: a perspective from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The one-dimensional spin-$s$ ${\rm SU}(2)$ ferromagnetic Heisenberg model, as a paradigmatic example for spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) with type-B Goldstone modes (GMs), is expected to exhibit an abstract fractal underlying the ground state subspace. This intrinsic abstract fractal is here revealed from a systematic investigation into the entanglement entropy for a linear combination of factorized (unentangled) ground states on a fractal decomposable into a set of the Cantor sets. The entanglement entropy scales logarithmically with the block size, with the prefactor being half the fractal dimension of a fractal, as long as the norm for the linear combination scales as the square root of the number of the self-similar building blocks kept at each step $k$ for a fractal, under an assumption that the maximum absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination is chosen to be around one, and the coefficients in the linear combination are almost constants within the building blocks. Actually, the set of the fractal dimensions for all the Cantor sets forms a {\it dense} subset in the interval $[0,1]$. As a consequence, the ground state subspace is separated into a disjoint union of countably infinitely many regions, each of which is labeled by a decomposable fractal. Hence, the interpretation of the prefactor as half the fractal dimension is valid for any support beyond a fractal, which in turn leads to the identification of the fractal dimension with the number of type-B GMs for the orthonormal basis states. Our argument may be extended to any quantum many-body systems undergoing SSB with type-B GMs.</description>

Abstract: The presence of symmetries can lead to nontrivial dynamics of operator entanglement in open quantum many-body systems, which characterizes the cost of an matrix product density operator (MPDO) representation of the density matrix in the tensor-network methods and provides a measure for the corresponding classical simulability. One example is the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric open quantum systems with dephasing, in which the operator entanglement increases logarithmically at late times instead of being suppressed by the dephasing. Here we numerically study the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of operator entanglement in a dissipative quantum many-body system with the more complicated $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry and dissipations beyond dephasing. We show that after the initial rise and fall, the operator entanglement also increases again in a logarithmic manner at late times in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric case. We find that this behavior can be fully understood from the corresponding $\mathrm{U}(1)$ subsymmetry by considering the symmetry-resolved operator entanglement. But unlike the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-symmetric case with dephasing, both the classical Shannon entropy associated with the probabilities for the half system being in different symmetry sectors and the corresponding symmetry-resolved operator entanglement have nontrivial contributions to the late time logarithmic growth of operator entanglement. Our results show evidence that the logarithmic growth of operator entanglement at long times is a generic behavior of dissipative quantum many-body dynamics with $\mathrm{U}(1)$ as the symmetry or subsymmetry and for more broad dissipations beyond dephasing. By breaking the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry of our quantum many-body dynamics to $\mathrm{U}(1)$, we also show that the latter property is valid even for open quantum systems with only $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Coherent control of photonic spin Hall effect in a Cavity</title>

Abstract: This paper theoretically investigates the manipulation of the Photonic Spin Hall Effect (photonic SHE) using a four-level closed coherent control coupling scheme in a cavity. The atomic system is configured to function as a combined Tripod and Lambda (CTL), Lambda $\Lambda$, and $N$ level model by properly adjusting the control field strengths and their relative phases. The system demonstrates multiple transparency windows in the CTL configuration, allowing the tunable photonic SHE to be used over a wider range of probe field detuning. At probe field resonance under the condition of electromagnetic induced transparency (EIT), the $\Lambda$-type system exhibits photonic SHE similar to the CTL system, showing a maximum upper limit of photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist. This upper limit arises due to zero absorption and dispersion. Control field strengths and atomic density do not influence photonic SHE at resonance for both atomic configurations. Our findings reveal that atomic density and strength of control fields significantly influence photonic SHE in the $N$-type model at resonance, offering additional control parameters for tuning photonic SHE. Finally, the results are equally valid and applicable to conventional $\Lambda$-type and N-type atomic systems, making the findings broadly relevant in cavity atomic systems. The results of angular photonic SHE are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require post-selection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Erasing Photon-Number Correlations through Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametric down-conversion source interfering on a beam splitter can be described as both a source of entangled N00N-states or a source of independent, and thus uncorrelated squeezers. The disparity between these outcomes can be attributed to whether one takes a standard discrete- or continuous-variable approach to describing the system. More precisely, this difference in output is due to the types of measurements involved and the way in which the data is processed, as both setups are identical, clearly identical states are produced. Here we take a hybrid approach to describe the state, which is generated by parametric down-conversion as input state, and investigate the measurements of the output ports of the interferometer using photon number resolved detection. We show that the output of this interference is separable in the photon number picture and demonstrate the worth of photon-number correlation measures for the characterization of squeezed light sources for hybrid applications like Gaussian boson-sampling.</description>

      <title>Direct Analysis of Zero-Noise Extrapolation: Polynomial Methods, Error Bounds, and Simultaneous Physical-Algorithmic Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used quantum error mitigation technique that artificially amplifies circuit noise and then extrapolates the results to the noise-free circuit. A common ZNE approach is Richardson extrapolation, which relies on polynomial interpolation. Despite its simplicity, efficient implementations of Richardson extrapolation face several challenges, including approximation errors from the non-polynomial behavior of noise channels, overfitting due to polynomial interpolation, and exponentially amplified measurement noise. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges, presenting bias and variance bounds that quantify approximation errors. Additionally, for any precision $\varepsilon$, our results offer an estimate of the necessary sample complexity. We further extend the analysis to polynomial least squares-based extrapolation, which mitigates measurement noise and avoids overfitting. Finally, we propose a strategy for simultaneously mitigating circuit and algorithmic errors in the Trotter-Suzuki algorithm by jointly scaling the time step size and the noise level. This strategy provides a practical tool to enhance the reliability of near-term quantum computations. We support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05243v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals exhibit measurement-induced phase transitions in their steady-state entanglement, with critical behavior that depends on the particular unraveling of the Lindblad dynamics. In this work, we investigate another key measure of quantum complexity -- nonstabilizerness (or ``magic'') -- and show that it follows a markedly different pattern. Importantly, in contrast to entanglement, for large system sizes, nonstabilizerness remains invariant under different unraveling schemes -- a property we attribute to the inherent permutational symmetry of the model. Although the steady-state stabilizer entropy does not display a genuine phase transition, it exhibits a singular derivative (a cusp) at the mean-field critical point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that finite-size simulations of the average Lindblad evolution fail to capture the asymptotic behavior of nonstabilizerness in the time-crystal phase, while quantum trajectory unravelings correctly reveal its extensive scaling with system size. These findings offer insights into how different quantum resources manifest in open systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen great progress in quantum computing, providing opportunities to overcome computational bottlenecks in many scientific applications. In particular, the intersection of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and quantum computing has become an active area of research with exponential computational speedup as an ultimate goal. In this work, we propose a quantum algorithm for the time-dependent smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Our algorithm uses concepts from discrete-time quantum walks to solve the one-dimensional advection partial differential equation via an SPH formalism. Hence, we construct a quantum circuit to carry out the calculations for a two-particle system over one, two and three timesteps. We compare its outputs with results from the classical SPH algorithm and show there is excellent agreement. The methodology and findings here are a key step towards developing a more general quantum SPH algorithm for solving practical engineering problems on gate-based quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of quantum information technology, designing efficient distributed quantum algorithms to perform various information processing tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we consider a distributed scenario where two parties, Alice and Bob, given access to matrices $A$ and $B$ respectively, aim to estimate ${\rm Tr}(f(A)g(B))$, where $f$ and $g$ are known functions. In this task, only local quantum operations, classical communication and single-qubit measurements are allowed due to the high cost of quantum communication and entangled measurements. We propose a distributed quantum algorithm framework to compute ${\rm Tr}(f(A)g(B))$ within an additive error $\varepsilon$. The proposed algorithm framework requires $\widetilde{O}\left(d^2 / (\delta \varepsilon^2)\right)$ quantum queries and two-qubit gates, assuming that the minimum singular value of each matrix $A, B \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ is at least $\delta$. Additionally, our algorithm framework uses a simple Hadamard test architecture, enabling easier quantum hardware implementation. This algorithm framework allows for various applications including quantum divergence estimation, distributed solving of linear system, and distributed Hamiltonian simulation, while preserving the privacy of both parties. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega\left(\max\left\{1 /\varepsilon^2, \sqrt{dr}/\varepsilon\right\}\right)$ on the query complexity for the task, where $r$ denotes the rank of the input matrices. We believe this framework holds broad applicability across a range of distributed quantum computing tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we present a high-dimensional QKD protocol utilizing the position and momentum entanglement of photon pairs. The protocol exploits the fact that position and momentum form mutually unbiased bases, linked via a Fourier transform. One photon of the entangled pair is measured by the sender in a randomly chosen basis-either position or momentum - selected passively via a 50:50 beamsplitter. This projective measurement remotely prepares the partner photon in a corresponding spatial mode, which is sent to the receiver (Bob), who similarly performs a random measurement in one of the two basis. This approach combines state preparation and measurement into a single process, eliminating the need for external random number generators. In this proof-of-principle demonstration, we achieve a photon information efficiency of 5.07 bits per photon using 90 spatial modes, and a maximum bit rate of 0.9 Kb/s with 361 modes. Looking ahead, we theoretically show that using the same entangled photon source but with next-generation event-based cameras - featuring improved quantum efficiency, timing and spatial resolution - our approach could achieve 10.9 bits per photon at 2500 spatial modes, and a maximum bit rate of 3.1 Mb/s with 5100 modes. This work establishes a scalable path toward high-dimensional, spatially encoded quantum communication with both high photon efficiency and secure bit rates.</description>

      <title>Time-of-Flow Distributions in Discrete Quantum Systems: From Operational Protocols to Quantum Speed Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09571v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general and experimentally accessible framework to quantify transition timing in discrete quantum systems via the time-of-flow (TF) distribution. Defined from the rate of population change in a target state, the TF distribution can be reconstructed through repeated projective measurements at discrete times on independently prepared systems, thus avoiding Zeno inhibition. In monotonic regimes, it admits a clear interpretation as a time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-of-departure (TOD) distribution. We apply this approach to optimize time-dependent Hamiltonians, analyze shortcut-to-adiabaticity (STA) protocols, study non-adiabatic features in the dynamics of a three-level time-dependent detuning model, and derive a transition-based quantum speed limit (TF-QSL) for both closed and open quantum systems. We also establish a lower bound on temporal uncertainty and examine decoherence effects, demonstrating the versatility of the TF framework for quantum control and diagnostics. This method provides both a conceptual tool and an experimental protocol for probing and engineering quantum dynamics in discrete-state platforms.</description>

Abstract: We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator. At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.</description>

Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary operation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing resource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to determine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for controllability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit arrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space dimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that are evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in order to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator controllable. The proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from smaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings. We illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively 127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Beyond asymptotic reasoning: the practicalities of a quantum ground state projector based on the wall-Chebyshev expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a quantum algorithm for ground-state preparation based on a Chebyshev series approximation to the wall function. In a classical setting, this approach is appealing as it guarantees rapid convergence. We analyze the asymptotic scaling and success probabilities of different quantum implementations and provide numerical benchmarks, comparing the performance of the wall-Chebyshev projectors with current state-of-the-art approachs. We find that this approach requires fewer serial applications of the Hamiltonian oracle to achieve a given ground state fidelity, but is severely limited by exponentially decaying success probability. However, we find that some implementations maintain non-trivial success probability in regimes where wall-Chebyshev projection leads to a fidelity improvement over other approaches. As the wall-Chebyshev projector is highly robust to loose known upper bounds on the true ground state energy, it offers a potential resource trade-off, particulary in the early fault-tolerant regime of quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation Programming via Typing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulations are designed to model quantum systems, and many compilation frameworks have been developed for executing such simulations on quantum computers. Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>HARLI CQUINN: Higher Adjusted Randomness with Linear In Complexity QUantum INspired Networks for K-Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We contrast a minimalistic implementation of quantum k-means algorithm to classical k-means algorithm. With classical simulation results, we demonstrate a quantum performance, on and above par, with the classical k-means algorithm. We present benchmarks of its accuracy for test cases of both well-known and experimental datasets. Despite extensive research into quantum k-means algorithms, our approach reveals previously unexplored methodological improvements. The encoding step can be minimalistic with classical data imported into quantum states more directly than existing approaches. The proposed quantum-inspired algorithm performs better in terms of accuracy and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) with respect to the bare classical k-means algorithm. By investigating multiple encoding strategies, we provide nuanced insights into quantum computational clustering techniques.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Non-Markovian Memory Effects for Robust Quantum Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence, which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM) with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic analysis of complex eigenmodes across avoided crossings in open microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Avoided crossings (ACs) are hallmark signatures of mode interaction in quantum and wave systems. Open microcavities whose resonances are naturally described as quasi-normal modes (QNMs) with complex eigenfrequencies offer a convenient platform to observe how openness and loss reorganize modal structure. We introduce a compact \emph{quadrature space} framework that represents a complex QNM by probability weights on its real and imaginary quadratures, and we apply Shannon-type measures to these distributions. This representation separates marginal spreading of each quadrature from inter quadrature correlation and is robust to nodal sets and exterior zero amplitude points. Applying the method to AC regions, we find that delocalization is driven not only by broadening of individual quadratures but also by a pronounced increase in internal correlation near at the AC, revealing an internal reorganization of resonant modes in non-Hermitian settings. The approach is broadly transferable to other open resonator platforms and provides a general information-theoretic diagnostic for openness-driven mode interactions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like dark matter from a SERF comagnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight axion-like particles are well-motivated relics that might compose the cosmological dark matter and source anomalous time-dependent magnetic fields. We report on terrestrial bounds from the Noble And Alkali Spin Detectors for Ultralight Coherent darK matter (NASDUCK) collaboration on the coupling of axion-like particles to neutrons and protons. The detector uses nuclei of noble-gas and alkali-metal atoms and operates in the Spin-Exchange Relaxation-Free~(SERF) regime, achieving high sensitivity to axion-like dark matter fields. Conducting a month-long search, we cover the mass range of $1.4\times 10^{-12}$~eV/$c^2$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$~eV/$c^2$ and provide limits which supersede robust astrophysical bounds, and improve upon previous terrestrial constraints by over two orders of magnitude for many masses within this range for protons, and up to two orders of magnitude for neutrons. These are the first reliable terrestrial bounds reported on the coupling of protons with axion-like dark matter, covering an unexplored terrain in its parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of interacting fermionic quantum models in $d$ dimensions with nodal interactions that exhibit superdiffusive transport. We establish non-perturbatively that the nodal structure of the interactions gives rise to long-lived quasiparticle excitations that result in a diverging diffusion constant, even though the system is fully chaotic. Using a Boltzmann equation approach, we find that the charge mode acquires an anomalous dispersion relation at long wavelength $\omega(q) \sim q^{z} $ with dynamical exponent $z={\rm min}[(2n+d)/2n,2]$, where $n$ is the order of the nodal point in momentum space. We verify our predictions in one dimensional systems using tensor-network techniques.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time structures of quantum impurities with a numerically exact few-body algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13706v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerically exact real-time evolution scheme for quantum impurities in a macroscopically large bath. The algorithm is few-body revealing, namely it identifies the electronic orbitals that can be made inactive (in a trivial product state) by a time-dependent orbital rotation. Following a quench, we show that both the number of active orbitals and their associated matrix product state bond dimensions saturate to small values, leading to an algorithm dramatically more accurate and faster than the state of the art. We are thus able to follow the dynamics for thousands of fermions, up to the long-time stationary regime, and to study subtle aspects of quantum relaxation in the spatio-temporal domain, such as the emergence of entanglement structures in the Kondo screening cloud.</description>

      <title>Probing Vortex Dynamics in 2D Superconductors with Scanning Quantum Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The visualization of the magnetic responses of a two-dimensional (2D) superconducting material on the nanoscale is a powerful approach to unravel the underlying supercurrent behavior and to investigate critical phenomena in reduced dimensions. In this study, scanning quantum microscopy is utilized to explore the local magnetic response of the 2D superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Our technique enables both static and dynamic sensing of superconducting vortices with high sensitivity and a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, unveiling unexpected phenomena linked to the intrinsic 2D nature of the superconductor, which are challenging to detect with more conventional local probes. Vortices do not arrange in a hexagonal lattice, but form a distorted vortex glass with expanding vortex size. A vortex can exhibit strong local dynamics due to thermal excitation. As the critical temperature is approached, a clear melting of the vortex glass is identified, leading to distinct configurations under different cooling conditions. Vortex fluctuations can also be probed through spin Hahn-echo measurements, which reveal the spin decoherence even well below the critical temperature -- and, intriguingly, enhanced decoherence at lower temperatures. Spatiotemporal microscopy of the magnetic dynamics associated with vortex excitations and fluctuations provides direct evidence of 2D superconducting phenomena at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Redefining Neural Operators in $d+1$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning mappings between function spaces. Among them, the kernel integral operator has been widely validated on universally approximating various operators. Although many advancements following this definition have developed effective modules to better approximate the kernel function defined on the original domain (with $d$ dimensions, $d=1, 2, 3\dots$), the unclarified evolving mechanism in the embedding spaces blocks researchers' view to design neural operators that can fully capture the target system evolution.
  Drawing on the Schr\"odingerisation method in quantum simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), we elucidate the linear evolution mechanism in neural operators. Based on that, we redefine neural operators on a new $d+1$ dimensional domain. Within this framework, we implement a Schr\"odingerised Kernel Neural Operator (SKNO) aligning better with the $d+1$ dimensional evolution. In experiments, the $d+1$ dimensional evolving designs in our SKNO consistently outperform other baselines across ten benchmarks of increasing difficulty, ranging from the simple 1D heat equation to the highly nonlinear 3D Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We also validate the resolution-invariance of SKNO on mixing-resolution training and zero-shot super-resolution tasks. In addition, we show the impact of different lifting and recovering operators on the prediction within the redefined NO framework, reflecting the alignment between our model and the underlying $d+1$ dimensional evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated resonant multiphoton excitation of high-angular-momentum planetary states of the strontium atom, a quasi-three-body Coulomb system, both experimentally and theoretically. A series of highly doubly excited electronic states converging to the double ionization threshold was identified and reproduced by first-principles calculations, which provided access to the two-electron wavefunctions of the resonances. In these states, the outer electron is dynamically localized at large distances by pendulum-like oscillations of the inner electron across the nucleus. A complementary simple molecular-like adiabatic model offers a clear interpretation of the correlated two-electron motion and suggests that the series is a general feature of highly doubly excited states of atoms and molecules.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyse, using the quantum tunnelling approach, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.</description>

      <title>Sub-femtosecond stabilization of multicore fiber for high-fidelity quantum networking at 100% duty cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally envisioned as a solution for the capacity crunch in telecommunications networks, multicore fibers (MCF) are contributing to scientific fields beyond telecom, such as sensing and metrology. Confined within the same cladding, the cores of MCF have a high degree of noise correlation which can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Here, we investigate MCF as a solution to the challenging problem of quantum and classical light co-existence in quantum networks by operating the quantum and stabilization light in separate but highly correlated cores of a 7-core MCF. Over 40 km of spooled fiber, we achieved 100 attosecond integrated jitter on one core by using phase information derived from another core. This allows for 100% duty cycle on a quantum channel while maintaining a low spurious photon rate from crosstalk between stabilization and quantum channels. With cycle-slip-free stabilization over 6 hours, frequency detuning between designated stabilization and quantum channels, and an additional 40 dB rejection of noise photons provided by the low optical crosstalk between cores, we achieved a Raman scattering-induced spurious photon rate of only 0.01 photons/s in 100 GHz bandwidth. Our results with MCF are a promising approach to ultra-stable quantum networks with 100% duty cycle on the quantum channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian simulation is a central application of quantum computing, with significant potential in modeling physical systems and solving complex optimization problems. Existing compilers for such simulations typically focus on low-level representations based on Pauli operators, limiting programmability and offering no formal guarantees of correctness across the compilation pipeline. We introduce QBlue, a high-level, formally verified framework for compiling Hamiltonian simulations. QBlue is based on the formalism of second quantization, which provides a natural and expressive way to describe quantum particle systems using creation and annihilation operators. To ensure safety and correctness, QBlue includes a type system that tracks particle types and enforces Hermitian structure. The framework supports compilation to both digital and analog quantum circuits and captures multiple layers of semantics, from static constraints to dynamic evolution. All components of QBlue, including its language design, type system, and compilation correctness, are fully mechanized in the Rocq proof framework, making it the first end-to-end verified compiler for second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying critical states in quasiperiodic systems is of great importance in localization physics. Previously identified critical states share a common characteristic: they exhibit persistent critical features in the thermodynamic limit. In this Letter, we predict an exotic type of critical state, termed size-dependent critical states, which exhibit a fundamentally distinct behavior. Specifically, they display critical localization signatures only at finite sizes, but transition to Anderson localization in the thermodynamic limit. We establish that the physical origin of size-dependent critical states lies in the synergistic interplay between local non-reciprocal domain wall and NHSE. By revealing a critical phase that challenges the established paradigm of critical localization, our work opens new avenues for exploring localization phenomena in quasiperiodic systems.</description>
