      <title>Structure of hypernucleus $_{\Lambda}^{7}$Li within microscopic three-cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of bound and resonance states of the hypernucleus $_{\Lambda}^{7}$Li is studied within a three-cluster model. This nucleus is considered a three-cluster structure consisting of $^{4}$He, a deuteron, and a lambda hyperon. The chosen three-cluster configuration allows us to describe more accurately the structure of hypernucleus $_{\Lambda}^{7}$Li and the dynamics of different processes that involve interactions of lightest nuclei and hypernuclei. The main goal of the present investigations is to find resonance states in the three-cluster continuum of $_{\Lambda}^{7}$Li and determine their nature. A set of narrow resonance states is detected at the energy range 0$&lt;E\leq$2 MeV above the three-cluster threshold $^{4}$He+$d$+$\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Seeing Through the Nucleus: A Review of Color Transparency Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the current status of the phenomenon of Color Transparency (CT), a fundamental consequence of the description of hadrons from Quantum Chromo Dynamics. CT refers to the vanishing of final (and/or initial) state interactions with the nuclear medium for exclusive process at sufficiently high enough momentum transfers. We discuss the current experimental observations relating to CT and their theoretical implications for other high energy processes. Future CT experiments and facilities are also described.</description>

      <title>The role of intermediate $\Delta\Delta$ states in nucleon-nucleon scattering in the large-$N_c$ and unitary limits, and $\Delta\Delta$ and $\Omega\Omega$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore potential explanations for why using large-$N_c$ ($N_c$ is the number of colors) scaling to determine the relative size of few-nucleon low-energy operators agrees with experiment even when dynamical $\Delta$'s are not explicitly included. Given that the large-$N_c$ analysis is predicated on the nucleons and $\Delta$'s being degenerate, this is a curious result. We show that for purely $S$-wave interactions the relationships dictated by large-$N_c$ scaling are unaffected whether the $\Delta$ is included or not. In the case of higher partial waves that do not mix with $S$-waves, the impact of the $\Delta$ is perturbative, which makes the agreement with naive ($\Delta$-less) large-$N_c$ ordering unsurprising. For higher partial waves that mix with $S$-waves, the nucleon and $\Delta$ would need to decouple to get agreement with naive large-$N_c$ ordering. We find all $NN$, $\Delta N$, and $\Delta\Delta$ low energy coefficients for leading-order baryon-baryon scattering in $\Delta$-full pionless effective field theory in terms of the two independent parameters dictated by the SU($2F$) spin-flavor symmetry that arises in the $N_c \rightarrow \infty$ limit. Because of recent lattice QCD results and experimental interest, we extend our analysis to the three-flavor case to study $\Omega\Omega$ scattering. We show that in the unitary limit (where scattering lengths become infinite) one of the two SU($2F$) parameters is driven to zero, resulting in enhanced symmetries, which agree with those found in spin-1/2 entanglement studies.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to reveal proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>First identification of a doublet wobbling excitation mode in $^{105}$Pd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An experimental investigation of $^{105}$Pd has revealed, for the first time, the existence of two wobbling bands, both having one phonon configuration and originating from excitation which is the wobbling from the yrast band with the $h_{11/2}$ quasineutron fully aligned with the short axis, and from an excited band with the same quasineutron but with less alignment along the short axis. These observations have been drawn from the measured ratios of the inter-band and intra-band gamma transition rates. Model calculations based on the triaxial projected shell model (TPSM) approach have been performed and are found to be in good agreement with the experimental energies and relative transition probabilities. The analysis of the TPSM results provides an insight into the nature of the observed structures at a microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Solving reaction dynamics with quantum computing algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The description of quantum many-body dynamics is extremely challenging on classical computers, as it can involve many degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the time evolution of quantum states is a natural application for quantum computers that are designed to efficiently perform unitary transformations. In this paper, we study quantum algorithms for response functions, relevant for describing different reactions governed by linear response. We focus on nuclear-physics applications and consider a qubit-efficient mapping on the lattice, which can efficiently represent the large volumes required for realistic scattering simulations. For the case of a contact interaction, we develop an algorithm for time evolution based on the Trotter approximation that scales logarithmically with the lattice size, and is combined with quantum phase estimation. We eventually focus on the nuclear two-body system and a typical response function relevant for electron scattering as an example. We also investigate ground-state preparation and examine the total circuit depth required for a realistic calculation and the hardware noise level required to interpret the signal.</description>

      <title>Axion-Like Particle Mediated Dark Matter and Neutron Star Properties in the QHD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the ALP-mediated dark matter (DM) model on neutron star properties using the Quantum Hadrodynamics model (QHD). Using the relativistic mean-field approximation with the QHD-ALP-DM framework, we compute the equation of state (EoS) of neutron stars. Based on our previous study, we find that typical ALP parameter values have no significant effect on the EoS. We then explore various parametrizations of this model by varying the DM Fermi momentum, $q_f$, and DM mass, $m_{\chi}$. Our results show that increasing $q_f$ or $m_{\chi}$ shifts the energy density to higher values while reducing the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars. Finally, comparison with observational constraints from gravitational wave events and pulsar measurements indicates that the allowed parameter space for this model is constrained to $q_f &lt; 0.05$ GeV and $m_{\chi} &lt; 1000$ GeV. As a result, our study highlights the importance of next-generation gamma-ray observatories, such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), in probing the ALP-mediated DM model.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>
