      <title>MM-InstructEval: Zero-Shot Evaluation of (Multimodal) Large Language Models on Multimodal Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising popularity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked a significant increase in research dedicated to evaluating these models. However, current evaluation studies predominantly concentrate on the ability of models to comprehend and reason within a unimodal (vision-only) context, overlooking critical performance evaluations in complex multimodal reasoning tasks that integrate both visual and text contexts. Furthermore, tasks that demand reasoning across multiple modalities pose greater challenges and require a deep understanding of multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework named MM-InstructEval, which integrates a diverse array of metrics to provide an extensive evaluation of the performance of various models and instructions across a broad range of multimodal reasoning tasks with vision-text contexts. MM-InstructEval enhances the research on the performance of MLLMs in complex multimodal reasoning tasks, facilitating a more thorough and holistic zero-shot evaluation of MLLMs. We firstly utilize the "Best Performance" metric to determine the upper performance limit of each model across various datasets. The "Mean Relative Gain" metric provides an analysis of the overall performance across different models and instructions, while the "Stability" metric evaluates their sensitivity to variations. Historically, the research has focused on evaluating models independently or solely assessing instructions, overlooking the interplay between models and instructions. To address this gap, we introduce the "Adaptability" metric, designed to quantify the degree of adaptability between models and instructions. Evaluations are conducted on 31 models (23 MLLMs) across 16 multimodal datasets, covering 6 tasks, with 10 distinct instructions. The extensive analysis enables us to derive novel insights.</description>

      <title>Quality of Experience Optimization for Real-time XR Video Transmission with Energy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR) is an important service in the 5G network and in future 6G networks. In contrast to traditional video on demand services, real-time XR video is transmitted frame-by-frame, requiring low latency and being highly sensitive to network fluctuations. In this paper, we model the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time XR video transmission on a frame-by-frame basis. Based on the proposed QoE model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes QoE with constraints on wireless resources and long-term energy consumption. We utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform the original problem into a single-frame optimization problem and then allocate wireless subchannels. We propose an adaptive XR video bitrate algorithm that employs a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for video bitrate selection. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, with the average QoE improvements of 0.04 to 0.46. Specifically, compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces average video quality variations by 29% to 50% and improves the frame transmission success rate by 5% to 48%.</description>

      <title>MADRL-Based Rate Adaptation for 360$\degree$ Video Streaming with Multi-Viewpoint Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few years, 360$\degree$ video traffic on the network has grown significantly. A key challenge of 360$\degree$ video playback is ensuring a high quality of experience (QoE) with limited network bandwidth. Currently, most studies focus on tile-based adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming based on single viewport prediction to reduce bandwidth consumption. However, the performance of models for single-viewpoint prediction is severely limited by the inherent uncertainty in head movement, which can not cope with the sudden movement of users very well. This paper first presents a multimodal spatial-temporal attention transformer to generate multiple viewpoint trajectories with their probabilities given a historical trajectory. The proposed method models viewpoint prediction as a classification problem and uses attention mechanisms to capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of input video frames and viewpoint trajectories for multi-viewpoint prediction. After that, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based ABR algorithm utilizing multi-viewpoint prediction for 360$\degree$ video streaming is proposed for maximizing different QoE objectives under various network conditions. We formulate the ABR problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) problem and present a MAPPO algorithm based on centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to solve the problem. The experimental results show that our proposed method improves the defined QoE metric by up to 85.5\% compared to existing ABR methods.</description>

      <title>Automatic Recognition of Food Ingestion Environment from the AIM-2 Wearable Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting an ingestion environment is an important aspect of monitoring dietary intake. It provides insightful information for dietary assessment. However, it is a challenging problem where human-based reviewing can be tedious, and algorithm-based review suffers from data imbalance and perceptual aliasing problems. To address these issues, we propose a neural network-based method with a two-stage training framework that tactfully combines fine-tuning and transfer learning techniques. Our method is evaluated on a newly collected dataset called ``UA Free Living Study", which uses an egocentric wearable camera, AIM-2 sensor, to simulate food consumption in free-living conditions. The proposed training framework is applied to common neural network backbones, combined with approaches in the general imbalanced classification field. Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our proposed method for automatic ingestion environment recognition successfully addresses the challenging data imbalance problem in the dataset and achieves a promising overall classification accuracy of 96.63%.</description>

      <title>Improving Multimodal Learning with Multi-Loss Gradient Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from multiple modalities, such as audio and video, offers opportunities for leveraging complementary information, enhancing robustness, and improving contextual understanding and performance. However, combining such modalities presents challenges, especially when modalities differ in data structure, predictive contribution, and the complexity of their learning processes. It has been observed that one modality can potentially dominate the learning process, hindering the effective utilization of information from other modalities and leading to sub-optimal model performance. To address this issue the vast majority of previous works suggest to assess the unimodal contributions and dynamically adjust the training to equalize them. We improve upon previous work by introducing a multi-loss objective and further refining the balancing process, allowing it to dynamically adjust the learning pace of each modality in both directions, acceleration and deceleration, with the ability to phase out balancing effects upon convergence. We achieve superior results across three audio-video datasets: on CREMA-D, models with ResNet backbone encoders surpass the previous best by 1.9% to 12.4%, and Conformer backbone models deliver improvements ranging from 2.8% to 14.1% across different fusion methods. On AVE, improvements range from 2.7% to 7.7%, while on UCF101, gains reach up to 6.1%.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Cross-Domain Audio-Visual Deception Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated deception detection is crucial for assisting humans in accurately assessing truthfulness and identifying deceptive behavior. Conventional contact-based techniques, like polygraph devices, rely on physiological signals to determine the authenticity of an individual's statements. Nevertheless, recent developments in automated deception detection have demonstrated that multimodal features derived from both audio and video modalities may outperform human observers on publicly available datasets. Despite these positive findings, the generalizability of existing audio-visual deception detection approaches across different scenarios remains largely unexplored. To close this gap, we present the first cross-domain audio-visual deception detection benchmark, that enables us to assess how well these methods generalize for use in real-world scenarios. We used widely adopted audio and visual features and different architectures for benchmarking, comparing single-to-single and multi-to-single domain generalization performance. To further exploit the impacts using data from multiple source domains for training, we investigate three types of domain sampling strategies, including domain-simultaneous, domain-alternating, and domain-by-domain for multi-to-single domain generalization evaluation. Furthermore, we proposed the Attention-Mixer fusion method to improve performance, and we believe that this new cross-domain benchmark will facilitate future research in audio-visual deception detection.

      <title>Unified Video-Language Pre-training with Synchronized Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-language pre-training is a typical and challenging problem that aims at learning visual and textual representations from large-scale data in a self-supervised way. Existing pre-training approaches either captured the correspondence of image-text pairs or utilized temporal ordering of frames. However, they do not explicitly explore the natural synchronization between audio and the other two modalities. In this work, we propose an enhanced framework for Video-Language pre-training with Synchronized Audio, termed as VLSA, that can learn tri-modal representations in a unified self-supervised transformer. Specifically, our VLSA jointly aggregates embeddings of local patches and global tokens for video, text, and audio. Furthermore, we utilize local-patch masked modeling to learn modality-aware features, and leverage global audio matching to capture audio-guided features for video and text. We conduct extensive experiments on retrieval across text, video, and audio. Our simple model pre-trained on only 0.9M data achieves improving results against state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, qualitative visualizations vividly showcase the superiority of our VLSA in learning discriminative visual-textual representations.</description>

      <title>SoccerNet-Echoes: A Soccer Game Audio Commentary Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in soccer offers numerous opportunities for sports analytics. Specifically, extracting audio commentaries with ASR provides valuable insights into the events of the game, and opens the door to several downstream applications such as automatic highlight generation. This paper presents SoccerNet-Echoes, an augmentation of the SoccerNet dataset with automatically generated transcriptions of audio commentaries from soccer game broadcasts, enhancing video content with rich layers of textual information derived from the game audio using ASR. These textual commentaries, generated using the Whisper model and translated with Google Translate, extend the usefulness of the SoccerNet dataset in diverse applications such as enhanced action spotting, automatic caption generation, and game summarization. By incorporating textual data alongside visual and auditory content, SoccerNet-Echoes aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for the development of algorithms specialized in capturing the dynamics of soccer games. We detail the methods involved in the curation of this dataset and the integration of ASR. We also highlight the implications of a multimodal approach in sports analytics, and how the enriched dataset can support diverse applications, thus broadening the scope of research and development in the field of sports analytics.</description>

      <title>FastSAG: Towards Fast Non-Autoregressive Singing Accompaniment Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing Accompaniment Generation (SAG), which generates instrumental music to accompany input vocals, is crucial to developing human-AI symbiotic art creation systems. The state-of-the-art method, SingSong, utilizes a multi-stage autoregressive (AR) model for SAG, however, this method is extremely slow as it generates semantic and acoustic tokens recursively, and this makes it impossible for real-time applications. In this paper, we aim to develop a Fast SAG method that can create high-quality and coherent accompaniments. A non-AR diffusion-based framework is developed, which by carefully designing the conditions inferred from the vocal signals, generates the Mel spectrogram of the target accompaniment directly. With diffusion and Mel spectrogram modeling, the proposed method significantly simplifies the AR token-based SingSong framework, and largely accelerates the generation. We also design semantic projection, prior projection blocks as well as a set of loss functions, to ensure the generated accompaniment has semantic and rhythm coherence with the vocal signal. By intensive experimental studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method can generate better samples than SingSong, and accelerate the generation by at least 30 times. Audio samples and code are available at https://fastsag.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Dialog Systems with Dual Knowledge-enhanced Generative Pretrained Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text response generation for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems, which aims to generate the proper text response given the multimodal context, is an essential yet challenging task. Although existing efforts have achieved compelling success, they still suffer from two pivotal limitations: 1) overlook the benefit of generative pre-training, and 2) ignore the textual context related knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual knowledge-enhanced generative pretrained language model for multimodal task-oriented dialog systems (DKMD), consisting of three key components: dual knowledge selection, dual knowledge-enhanced context learning, and knowledge-enhanced response generation. To be specific, the dual knowledge selection component aims to select the related knowledge according to both textual and visual modalities of the given context. Thereafter, the dual knowledge-enhanced context learning component targets seamlessly integrating the selected knowledge into the multimodal context learning from both global and local perspectives, where the cross-modal semantic relation is also explored. Moreover, the knowledge-enhanced response generation component comprises a revised BART decoder, where an additional dot-product knowledge-decoder attention sub-layer is introduced for explicitly utilizing the knowledge to advance the text response generation. Extensive experiments on a public dataset verify the superiority of the proposed DKMD over state-of-the-art competitors.</description>

      <title>AudioLDM 2: Learning Holistic Audio Generation with Self-supervised Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although audio generation shares commonalities across different types of audio, such as speech, music, and sound effects, designing models for each type requires careful consideration of specific objectives and biases that can significantly differ from those of other types. To bring us closer to a unified perspective of audio generation, this paper proposes a framework that utilizes the same learning method for speech, music, and sound effect generation. Our framework introduces a general representation of audio, called "language of audio" (LOA). Any audio can be translated into LOA based on AudioMAE, a self-supervised pre-trained representation learning model. In the generation process, we translate any modalities into LOA by using a GPT-2 model, and we perform self-supervised audio generation learning with a latent diffusion model conditioned on LOA. The proposed framework naturally brings advantages such as in-context learning abilities and reusable self-supervised pretrained AudioMAE and latent diffusion models. Experiments on the major benchmarks of text-to-audio, text-to-music, and text-to-speech demonstrate state-of-the-art or competitive performance against previous approaches. Our code, pretrained model, and demo are available at https://audioldm.github.io/audioldm2.</description>
