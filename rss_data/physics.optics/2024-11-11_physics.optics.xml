      <title>Biquaternion Signal Processing for Nonlinear Ultrasonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and classification of scattered nonlinear ultrasonic signatures in 2 dimensional complex damaged media using Time Reversal based Nonlinear Elastic Wave Spectroscopy (TR-NEWS) approach is extended to 3 dimensional complex damaged media. In (2+1)D, i.e. space 2 dimensional time 1 dimensional spacetime, we used quaternion bases for analyses, while in (3+1)D, we use biquaternion bases.
  The optimal weight function of the path of ultrasonic wave in (3+1)D lattice is obtained by using the Echo State Network (ESN) which is a Machine Learning technique. The hysteresis effect is incorporated by using the Preisach-Mayergoyz model.</description>

      <title>Backscattering-Immune Floquet Conversion in Ring Modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscattering in micro-ring cavities induces mode mixing and limits device performance. Existing methods to mitigate backscattering often involve complex fabrication processes or are insufficient for complete suppression. In this work, we introduce a novel method to eliminate backscattering by operating the cavity at an exceptional point (EP). By engineering non-conservative coupling between degenerate clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) modes, we achieve chiral transmission that prevents degeneracy lifting and suppresses unwanted mode coupling. Unlike previous approaches that rely on precise gain-loss balance or complex structures, our method utilizes non-conservative coupling between the counterpropgating cavity modes. Using this method, we further show significant enhancement in the cavity performance in Floquet mode conversion efficiency at the EP. Our highly adaptable approach enables seamless integration into various photonic platforms with electro-optic modulators. This advancement mitigates backscattering and improves the precision of light-matter interactions, offering promising applications in quantum communication and information processing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Width of Maximum Deposition Eigenchannels in Diffusive Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum deposition eigenchannel provides the largest possible power delivery to a target region inside a diffusive medium by optimizing the incident wavefront of a monochromatic beam. It originates from constructive interference of scattered waves, which is frequency sensitive. We investigate the spectral width of maximum deposition eigenchannels over a range of target depths using numerical simulations of a 2D diffusive system. Compared to tight focusing into the system, power deposition to an extended region is more sensitive to frequency detuning. The spectral width of enhanced delivery to a large target displays a rather weak, non-monotonic variation with target depth, in contrast to a sharp drop of focusing bandwidth with depth. While the maximum enhancement of power deposited within a diffusive system can exceed that of power transmitted through it, this comes at the cost of a narrower spectral width. We investigate the narrower deposition width in terms of the constructive interference of transmission eigenchannels within the target. We further observe that the spatial field distribution inside the target region decorrelates slower with spectral detuning than power decay of the maximum deposition eigenchannel. Additionally, absorption increases the spectral width of deposition eigenchannels, but the depth dependence remains qualitatively identical to that without absorption. These findings hold for any diffusive waves, including electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves, pressure waves, mesoscopic electrons, and cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Extreme narrow band in Moir\'e Photonic time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moir\'e superlattice has attracted growing interest in the electromagnetic and optical communities. Here, we extend this concept to time-varying photonic systems by superposing two binary modulations on the refractive index with different modulation periods, i.e., the Moir\'e photonic time crystal (PTC). Such a Moir\'e PTC leads to extreme narrow bands in momentum space which supports temporal localized modes, exhibiting periodically self-reconstructing pulse in time domain. We investigate how the modulation parameters change the bandstructure of the Moir\'e PTC and the temporal localization behavior. Moreover, we explore mode-locking mechanism in frequency space in the Moir\'e PTC, which points towards potential applications in mode-locked lasers with tunable time width of the emitted pulses. Our work therefore extends the study of PTC to complex modulation patterns, and unveils new possibility in wave manipulation with time-varying systems.</description>

      <title>Long-term stable laser injection locking for quasi-CW applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating high output powers while achieving narrow line single mode lasing are often mutual exclusive properties of commercial laser diodes. For this reason, efficient and scalable amplification of narrow line laser light is still a major driving point in modern laser system designs. Commonly, injection locking of high-power semiconductor laser diodes are used for this purpose. However, for many laser diodes it is very challenging to achieve stable operation of the injection locked state due to a complex interplay of non-linearities and thermal effects. Different approaches of active or passive stabilization usually require a large overhead of optical and electrical equipment and are not generally applicable. In our work we present a passive stabilization scheme, that is generally applicable, technically easy to implement and extremely cost-effective. It is based on the externally synchronized automatic acquisition of the optimal injection state. Central to our simple but powerful scheme is the management of thermalization effects during lock acquisition. By periodical relocking, spectrally pure amplified light is maintained in a quasi-CW manner over long timescales. We characterize the performance of our method for laser diodes amplifying 671 nm light and demonstrate the general applicability by confirming the method to work also for laser diodes at 401 nm, 461 nm and 689 nm. Our scheme enables the scaled operation of injection locks, even in cascaded setups, for the distributed amplification of single frequency laser light.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Purcell Enhancement of Non-Hermitian Metasurfaces with Spectral Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of an emitter near a resonant structure. However, evaluating the Purcell factor quantitatively and empirically is difficult due to the difficulties in measuring the electromagnetic nearfield of an optical resonance for calculation of the exact effective modal volume, especially with non-Hermitian resonators. Therefore, we propose a new analytical approach to circumvent the need to measure the nearfield and predict the Purcell enhancement with an analytical model and spectrally measurable parameters. Our proposed model predicts the averaged Purcell enhancement by metasurfaces on a photoluminescence medium, and is verified with experimental measurements and numerical simulations of nanoparticle arrays coupled to a fluorescent thin film. The model directly analyzes the photoluminescence enhancement and extraction efficiency of metasurface, and can be generalized to work with arbitrarily-shaped photoluminescent medium that is coupled to a resonator. This discovery will facilitate optimization of metasurfaces that support open cavity modes for efficient extraction of enhanced luminescence.</description>

      <title>Combining Bayesian Optimization, SVD and Machine Learning for Advanced Optical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and optimization of optical components, such as Bragg gratings, are critical for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and photonic circuits. To overcome the limitations of traditional design methods that rely heavily on computationally intensive simulations and large datasets, we propose an integrated methodology that significantly reduces these burdens while maintaining high accuracy in predicting optical response. First, we employ a Bayesian optimization technique to strategically select a limited yet informative number of simulation points from the design space, ensuring that each contributes maximally to the model's performance. Second, we utilize singular value decomposition to effectively parametrize the entire reflectance spectra into a reduced set of coefficients, allowing us to capture all significant spectral features without losing crucial information. Finally, we apply XGBoost, a robust machine learning algorithm, to predict the entire reflectance spectra from the reduced dataset. The combination of Bayesian optimization for data selection, SVD for full-spectrum fitting, and XGBoost for predictive modeling provides a powerful, generalizable framework for the design of optical components.</description>

      <title>Digitization of 93.3-keV recoilless $\gamma$-radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a technique for transforming the intensity of quasi-monochromatic recoilless radiation with a photon energy of 93.3 keV, emitted by radioactive M\"ossbauer sources 67Ga or 67Cu, into a sequence of short pulses with individually and independently controlled, on demand, the moments of appearance of pulses, as well as the peak intensity, duration and shape of each pulse. The technique is based on the transmission of recoilless (M\"ossbauer) 93.3-keV photons from the source through a medium containing resonantly absorbing 67Zn nuclei. The pulses are formed due to the rapid reciprocating movement of the source relative to the absorber at specified moments in time along the direction of photon propagation at a distance not exceeding half the radiation wavelength. The produced sequences of $\gamma$-ray pulses are similar to the digitization of information carried by electromagnetic waves. They can also be used to develop M\"ossbauer spectroscopy of the atomic and subatomic structures, as well as open novel opportunities for $\gamma$-ray quantum optics.</description>

      <title>On-chip Moir\'e Optical Skyrmion Clusters with Nanoscale Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory, and are recognized as a suitable unit in the high-density, low-dissipation microelectronic devices in condensed matter physics. Their remarkably stable topology has been observed in electromagnetic waves recently. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\'e optical skyrmion clusters-multiskyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster-crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\'e optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Electron vortex beams for chirality probing at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose a method for probing the chirality of nanoscale electromagnetic near fields utilizing the properties of a coherent superposition of free-electron vortex states in electron microscopes. Electron beams optically modulated into vortices carry orbital angular momentum, thanks to which they are sensitive to the spatial phase distribution and topology of the investigated field. The sense of chirality of the studied specimen can be extracted from the spectra of the electron beam with nanoscale precision owing to the short picometer de Broglie wavelength of the electron beam. We present a detailed case study of the interaction of a coherent superposition of electron vortex states and the optical near field of a golden nanosphere illuminated by circularly polarized light as an example, and we examine the chirality sensitivity of electron vortex beams on intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanoantennae.</description>

      <title>Long-range and dead-zone free dual-comb ranging for the interferometric tracking of moving targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-comb ranging has emerged as an effective technology for long-distance metrology, providing absolute distance measurements with high speed, precision, and accuracy. Here, we demonstrate a dual-comb ranging method that utilizes a free-space transceiver unit, enabling dead-zone-free measurements and simultaneous ranging with interchanged comb roles to allow for long-distance measurements even when the target is moving. It includes a GPU-accelerated algorithm for real-time signal processing and a free-running single-cavity solid-state dual-comb laser with a carrier wavelength $\lambda_c \approx$ 1055 nm, a pulse repetition rate of 1 GHz and a repetition rate difference of 5.06 kHz. This combination offers a fast update rate and sufficient signal strength to reach a single-shot time-of-flight precision of around 0.1 $\mu$m (i.e. $&lt; \lambda_c/4$) on a cooperative target placed at a distance of more than 40 m. The free-running laser is sufficiently stable to use the phase information for interferometric distance measurements, which improves the single-shot precision to $&lt;$20 nm. To assess the ranging accuracy, we track the motion of the cooperative target when moved over 40 m and compare it to a reference interferometer. The residuals between the two measurements are below 3 $\mu$m. These results highlight the potential of this approach for accurate and dead-zone-free long-distance ranging, supporting real-time tracking with nm-level precision.</description>

      <title>Polarization-independent metasurfaces based on bound states in the continuum with high Q-factor and resonance modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces offer a powerful platform for effective light manipulation, which is crucial for advanced optical technologies. While designs of polarization-independent structures have reduced the need for polarized illumination, they are often limited by either low Q factors or low resonance modulation. Here, we design and experimentally demonstrate a metasurface with polarization-independent quasi-bound state in the continuum (quasi-BIC), where the unit cell consists of four silicon squares arranged in a two-dimensional array and the resonance properties can be controlled by adjusting the edge length difference between different squares. Our metasurface experimentally achieves a Q factor of approximately 100 and a resonance modulation of around 50%. This work addresses a common limitation in previous designs, which either achieved high Q factors exceeding 200 with a resonance modulation of less than 10%, leading to challenging signal-to-noise ratio requirements, or achieved strong resonance modulation with Q factors of only around 10, limiting light confinement and fine-tuning capabilities. In contrast, our metasurface ensures that the polarization-independent signal is sharp and distinct within the system, reducing the demands on signal-to-noise ratio and improving robustness. Experiments show the consistent performance across different polarization angles. This work contributes to the development of versatile optical devices, enhancing the potential for the practical application of BIC-based designs in areas such as optical filtering and sensing.</description>

      <title>Telecom wavelength quantum dots interfaced with silicon-nitride circuits via photonic wire bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits find ubiquitous use in various technologies, from communication, to computing and sensing, and therefore play a crucial role in the quantum technology counterparts. Several systems are currently under investigation, each showing distinct advantages and drawbacks. For this reason, efforts are made to effectively combine different platforms in order to benefit from their respective strengths. In this work, 3D laser written photonic wire bonds are employed to interface triggered sources of quantum light, based on semiconductor quantum dots embedded into etched microlenses, with low-loss silicon-nitride photonics. Single photons at telecom wavelengths are generated by the In(Ga)As quantum dots which are then funneled into a silicon-nitride chip containing single-mode waveguides and beamsplitters. The second-order correlation function of g(2)(0) = 0.11+/-0.02, measured via the on-chip beamsplitter, clearly demonstrates the transfer of single photons into the silicon-nitride platform. The photonic wire bonds funnel on average 28.6+/-8.8% of the bare microlens emission (NA = 0.6) into the silicon-nitride-based photonic integrated circuit even at cryogenic temperatures. This opens the route for the effective future up-scaling of circuitry complexity based on the use of multiple different platforms.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Multipole Theory for Two-dimensional Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a full-wave electromagnetic (EM) theory for calculating the multipole decomposition in two-dimensional (2-D) structures consisting of isolated, arbitrarily shaped, inhomogeneous, anisotropic cylinders or a collection of such. To derive the multipole decomposition, we first solve the scattering problem by expanding the scattered electric field in divergenceless cylindrical vector wave functions (CVWF) with unknown expansion coefficients that characterize the multipole response. These expansion coefficients are then expressed via contour integrals of the vectorial components of the scattered electric field evaluated via an electric field volume integral equation (EFVIE). The kernels of the EFVIE are the products of the tensorial 2-D Green's function (GF) expansion and the equivalent 2-D volumetric electric and magnetic current densities. We validate the theory using the commercial finite element solver COMSOL Multiphysics. In the validation, we compute the multipole decomposition of the fields scattered from various 2-D structures and compare the results with alternative formulations. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the theory to study an emerging photonics application on oligomers-based highly directional switching using active media. This analysis addresses a critical gap in current literature, where multipole theories exist primarily for three-dimensional (3-D) particles of isotropic materials. Our work enhances the understanding and utilization of the optical properties of 2-D, inhomogeneous, and anisotropic cylindrical structures, contributing to advancements in photonic and meta-optics technologies.</description>

      <title>On-chip rewritable phase-change metasurface for programmable diffractive deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks capable of rapid programming are indispensable to realize many functionalities. Phase change technology can provide nonvolatile programmability in photonic neural networks. Integrating direct laser writing technique with phase change material (PCM) can potentially enable programming and in-memory computing for on-chip photonic neural networks. Sb2Se3 is a newly introduced ultralow-loss phase change material with a large refractive index contrast over the telecommunication transmission band. Compact, low-loss, rewritable, and nonvolatile on-chip phase-change metasurfaces can be created by using direct laser writing on a Sb2Se3 thin film. Here, by cascading multiple layers of on-chip phase-change metasurfaces, an ultra-compact on-chip programmable diffractive deep neural network is demonstrated at the wavelength of 1.55um and benchmarked on two machine learning tasks of pattern recognition and MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) handwritten digits classification and accuracies comparable to the state of the art are achieved. The proposed on-chip programmable diffractive deep neural network is also advantageous in terms of power consumption because of the ultralow-loss of the Sb2Se3 and its nonvolatility which requires no constant power supply to maintain its programmed state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular optics aims to understand and manipulate light's topological defects, pioneered by the discovery that phase vortex lines, strands of destructive interference, naturally occur in scalar wave fields. Monochromatic electromagnetic fields, however, are described by complex three-dimensional vectors that make individual scalar phase vortices in their vector components, which depend on the choice of co-ordinate basis, less meaningful. Instead, polarisation singularities can capture the vector texture of complicated, even non-paraxial light, with separate spatial descriptions for the electric $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic $\mathbf{H}$ fields. But polarisation textures, too, are basis-dependent, because the laws of electromagnetism can be expressed not only by separate $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{H}$ fields, but by linear combinations of the two. We instead propose fundamental, basis-independent topological features generic in monochromatic electromagnetic fields: one- and two-dimensional structures that relate to time-averaged symmetries, including parity, duality and time-reversal, held locally by the combined electric and magnetic field polarisation geometry.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Reconfigurable, Physically Composable Hybrid Diffractive Optical Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs), leveraging free-space light wave propagation for ultra-parallel, high-efficiency computing, have emerged as promising artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. However, their inherent lack of reconfigurability due to fixed optical structures post-fabrication hinders practical deployment in the face of dynamic AI workloads and evolving applications. To overcome this challenge, we introduce, for the first time, a multi-dimensional reconfigurable hybrid diffractive ONN system (MDR-HDONN), a physically composable architecture that unlocks a new degree of freedom and unprecedented versatility in DONNs. By leveraging full-system learnability, MDR-HDONN repurposes fixed fabricated optical hardware, achieving exponentially expanded functionality and superior task adaptability through the differentiable learning of system variables. Furthermore, MDR-HDONN adopts a hybrid optical/photonic design, combining the reconfigurability of integrated photonics with the ultra-parallelism of free-space diffractive systems. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MDR-HDONN has digital-comparable accuracy on various task adaptations with 74x faster speed and 194x lower energy. Compared to prior DONNs, MDR-HDONN shows exponentially larger functional space with 5x faster training speed, paving the way for a new paradigm of versatile, composable, hybrid optical/photonic AI computing. We will open-source our codes.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps.</description>

      <title>Quantum hyperspins: Highly nonclassical collective behavior in quantum optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the emergence of a highly non-classical collective behavior in quantum parametric oscillators, which we name quantum hyperspin, induced by a tailored nonlinear interaction. This is the second quantized version of classical multidimensional spherical spins, as XY spins in two dimensions, and Heisenberg spins in three dimensions. In the phase space, the quantum hyperspins are represented as spherical shells whose radius scales with the number of particles in a way such that it cannot be factorized even in the limit of large particle number. We show that the nonlinearly coupled quantum oscillators form a high-dimensional entangled state that is surprisingly robust with respect to the coupling with the environment. Such a behavior results from a properly engineered reservoir. Networks of entangled quantum hyperspins are a new approach to quantum simulations for applications in computing, Ising machines, and high-energy physics models. We analyze from first principles through ab initio numerical simulations the properties of quantum hyperspins, including the interplay of entanglement and coupling frustration.</description>

      <title>Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</description>

      <title>Tunneling-like wave transmission in non-Hermitian lattices with mirrored nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a peculiar tunneling phenomenon that occurs in lattices with nonreciprocal couplings. The nonreciprocity holds for an inner portion of the lattice, constituting a non-Hermitian interface between outer Hermitian sections. The couplings are mirrored about the interface center. As a standalone system that was widely studied in recent years, each section of the interface supports the non-Hermitian skin effect, in which modes are accumulated at one boundary. Here, we investigate what happens to a wave that propagates along the lattice and hits the interface. The skin mode accumulation, which effectively constitutes a barrier, forbids wave penetration into the interface, but surprisingly, under certain conditions the wave is transmitted to the other side, keeping the interface dark, as if the wave invisibly tunneled through it. Remarkably, the tunneling is independent of the interface length, and a perfect transmission can be achieved independently of frequency and nonreciprocity strength. We derive the phenomenon both for quantum and classical systems, and realize it experimentally in an active topoelectric metamaterial. Our study fosters the research of wave tunneling through other types of non-Hermitian interfaces, which may also include nonlinearities, time-dependence and more.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focuses on studying $N$th-order EPs in $(N\leq4)$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this work, we introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated eigenstates have support on a subset of sites and exhibit the NH skin effect, which can be tuned to localize on the opposite end of the chain compared to all remaining states. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced symmetry breaking in a system of two parametrically driven Kerr-Duffing oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a system comprising a pair of Kerr-Duffing nonlinear oscillators, which are coupled through a nonlinear interaction and subjected to a parametric drive. Using the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we analyze the steady-state solutions for the amplitudes of the two oscillators. For the case of almost identical oscillators, we investigate separately the cases in which only one oscillator is parametrically driven and in which both oscillators are simultaneously driven. In the latter regime, we demonstrate that even when the parametric drives acting on the two oscillators are identical, the system can transition from a stable Nesymmetric solution to a broken-symmetry solution as the detuning is varied.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix Approach for Topological Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest and develop a novel approach for describing topological properties of a periodic system purely from the transfer matrix associated to a unit cell. Our approach uses the Iwasawa decomposition to parametrise the transfer matrix uniquely in terms of three real numbers. This allows us to obtain simple conditions for the existence of topologically protected edge states and to provide a visual illustration of all possible solutions. In order to demonstrate our method in action, we apply it to study some generalisations of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, such as the tetramer SSH4 model and a dimerised one-dimensional photonic crystal. Finally, we also obtained a simple pictorial proof of the Zak phase bulk-edge correspondence for any one dimensional system using this approach.</description>
