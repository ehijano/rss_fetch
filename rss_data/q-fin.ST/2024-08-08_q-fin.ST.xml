      <title>Sentiment Analysis of State Bank of Pakistan's Monetary Policy Documents and its Impact on Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines whether sentiments conveyed in the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) communications impact financial market expectations and can act as a monetary policy tool. To achieve our goal, we first use sentiment analysis techniques to quantify the tone of SBP monetary policy documents and second, we use short time window, high frequency methodology to approximate the impact of tone on stock market returns. Our results show that positive (negative) change in the tone positively (negatively) impacts stock returns in Karachi Stock Exchange. Further extension shows that the communication of SBP still has a statistically significant impact on stock returns when controlling for different variables and monetary policy tool. Also, the communication of SBP does not have a long term constant effect on stock market.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil Final: Backdoor attack via Stock market and Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Asymmetric Causality Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric causality tests are increasingly gaining popularity in different scientific fields. This approach corresponds better to reality since logical reasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical investigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via partial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables operating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the n residuals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the ordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient. Additionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal parameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to assess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically significant, but also if their difference is statistically significant. Consequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should explicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The purpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An application is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the asymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide are efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.</description>
