      <title>Global optimization for data assimilation in landslide tsunamis models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this article is to make automatic data assimilation for a landslide tsunami model, given by the coupling between a non-hydrostatic multi-layer shallow-water and a Savage-Hutter granular landslide model for submarine avalanches. The coupled model is discretized using a positivity-preserving second-order path-conservative finite volume scheme. The data assimilation problem is posed in a global optimization framework and we develop and compare parallel metaheuristic stochastic global optimization algorithms, more precisely multi-path versions of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, with hybrid global optimization algorithms based on hybridizing Simulated Annealing with gradient local searchers, like L-BGFS-B.</description>

      <title>Time Series Foundation Models and Deep Learning Architectures for Earthquake Temporal and Spatial Nowcasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing the capabilities of earthquake nowcasting, the real-time forecasting of seismic activities remains a crucial and enduring objective aimed at reducing casualties. This multifaceted challenge has recently gained attention within the deep learning domain, facilitated by the availability of extensive, long-term earthquake datasets. Despite significant advancements, existing literature on earthquake nowcasting lacks comprehensive evaluations of pre-trained foundation models and modern deep learning architectures. These architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, uniquely focus on different aspects of data, including spatial relationships, temporal patterns, and multi-scale dependencies. This paper addresses the mentioned gap by analyzing different architectures and introducing two innovation approaches called MultiFoundationQuake and GNNCoder. We formulate earthquake nowcasting as a time series forecasting problem for the next 14 days within 0.1-degree spatial bins in Southern California, spanning from 1986 to 2024. Earthquake time series is forecasted as a function of logarithm energy released by quakes. Our comprehensive evaluation employs several key performance metrics, notably Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and Mean Squared Error, over time in each spatial region. The results demonstrate that our introduced models outperform other custom architectures by effectively capturing temporal-spatial relationships inherent in seismic data. The performance of existing foundation models varies significantly based on the pre-training datasets, emphasizing the need for careful dataset selection. However, we introduce a new general approach termed MultiFoundationPattern that combines a bespoke pattern with foundation model results handled as auxiliary streams. In the earthquake case, the resultant MultiFoundationQuake model achieves the best overall performance.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of ablating meteorite samples for improved meteoroid composition diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission spectra and diagnostic spectral features of a diverse range of ablated meteorite samples with a known composition are presented. We aim to provide a reference spectral dataset to improve our abilities to classify meteoroid composition types from meteor spectra observations. The data were obtained by ablating meteorite samples in high-enthalpy plasma wind tunnel facilities recreating conditions characteristic of low-speed meteors. Near-UV to visible-range (320 - 800 nm) emission spectra of 22 diverse meteorites captured by a high-resolution Echelle spectrometer were analyzed to identify the characteristic spectral features of individual meteorite groups. The same dataset captured by a lower-resolution meteor spectrograph was applied to compare the meteorite data with meteor spectra observations. Spectral modeling revealed that the emitting meteorite plasma was characterized by temperatures of 3700 - 4800 K, similar to the main temperature component of meteors. The studied line intensity variations were found to trace the differences in the original meteorite composition and thus can be used to constrain the individual meteorite classes. We demonstrate that meteorite composition types, including ordinary chondrites, carbonaceous chondrites, various achondrites, stony-iron and iron meteorites, can be spectrally distinguished by measuring relative line intensities of Mg I, Fe I, Na I, Cr I, Mn I, Si I, H I, CN, Ni I, and Li I. Additionally, we confirm the effect of the incomplete evaporation of refractory elements Al, Ti, and Ca, and the presence of minor species Co I, Cu I, and V I.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Foundation Model Adaptation: Pioneering Computer Vision Models for Geophysical Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore adapting foundation models (FMs) from the computer vision domain to geoscience. FMs, large neural networks trained on massive datasets, excel in diverse tasks with remarkable adaptability and generality. However, geoscience faces challenges like lacking curated training datasets and high computational costs for developing specialized FMs. This study considers adapting FMs from computer vision to geoscience, analyzing their scale, adaptability, and generality for geoscientific data analysis. We introduce a workflow that leverages existing computer vision FMs, fine-tuning them for geoscientific tasks, reducing development costs while enhancing accuracy. Through experiments, we demonstrate this workflow's effectiveness in broad applications to process and interpret geoscientific data of lunar images, seismic data, DAS arrays and so on. Our findings introduce advanced ML techniques to geoscience, proving the feasibility and advantages of cross-domain FMs adaptation, driving further advancements in geoscientific data analysis and offering valuable insights for FMs applications in other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Rectifying bedload flux variability from channel geometry and grain shape effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bedload transport occurs when a bed composed of sedimentary grains becomes mobile in response to the shearing by a flow of liquid. It shapes the landscapes of Earth and other planetary bodies by promoting the formation and growth of various multiscale geological features. Estimating the rate at which such processes take place requires accurate bedload flux predictions. However, even for highly idealized conditions in the laboratory, study-to-study variability of reported bedload flux measurements borders an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, typically empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive and validate a universal method of bed shear stress determination and apply it to a number of independent grain-shape-controlled data sets from experiments and CFD-DEM simulations for a very diverse range of transport conditions. An existing physical bedload flux model, here generalized to account for grain shape variability, predicts almost all these data within a factor of 1.3, whereas a recently proposed grain shape correction of the bed shear stress (Deal et al., Nature 613, 298-302, 2023) substantially increases the bedload flux scatter across weak and intense transport conditions.</description>
