      <title>Soliton resolution for the energy-critical nonlinear heat equation in the radial case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the Soliton Resolution Conjecture for the radial critical non-linear heat equation in dimension $D\geq 3.$ Thus, every finite energy solution resolves, continuously in time, into a finite superposition of asymptotically decoupled copies of the ground state and free radiation.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity for Poisson equations involving measures supported on $C^{1,\operatorname{Dini}}$ interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal Lipschitz regularity of solutions to Poisson's equation with measure data supported on a $C^{1,\operatorname{Dini}}$ interface and with $C^{0,\operatorname{Dini}}$ density. We achieve this by deriving pointwise gradient estimates on the interface, further showing the piecewise differentiability of solutions up to this surface. Our approach relies on perturbation arguments and estimates for the Green's function of the Laplacian. Additionally, we provide counterexamples highlighting the minimality of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Flows and Their Applications in Parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel Systems Part II: Shear Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the behavior of three-dimensional parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel (PKS) systems in the presence of ambient shear flows. Our findings demonstrate that when the total mass of the cell density is below a specific threshold, the solution remains globally regular as long as the flow is sufficiently strong. The primary difficulty in our analysis stems from the fast creation of chemical gradients due to strong shear advection.</description>

      <title>The jet problem for three-dimensional axially symmetric full compressible subsonic flows with nonzero vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for given Bernoulli function and entropy function at the upstream, if the incoming mass flux is within a suitable range, then there exists a unique outer pressure such that smooth subsonic three-dimensional axially symmetric jet flows for steady full Euler system with nonzero vorticity exist and have certain far fields behavior. A key observation is that we can transform the jet problem for three-dimensional axially symmetric steady full Euler system with nonzero vorticity into a variational problem in terms of the stream function. Moreover, using uniform estimates of the stream function and the iteration method, we exclude the singularity of the jet flows near the symmetry axis.</description>

      <title>Green's Function and Pointwise Space-time Behaviors of the Three-Dimensional Relativistic Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pointwise space-time behavior of the Green's function of the three-dimensional relativistic Boltzmann equation is studied in this paper. It is shown that the Green's function has a decomposition of the macroscopic diffusive waves and Huygens waves with the speed $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ at low-frequency, the singular kinetic wave and the remainder term decaying exponentially in space and time. In addition, we establish the pointwise space-time estimate of the global solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation with non-smooth initial data based on the Green's function.</description>

      <title>An interpolation approach to $L^{\infty}$ a priori estimates for elliptic problems with nonlinearity on the boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an explicit $L^\infty(\Om)$ a priori estimate for weak solutions to subcritical elliptic problems with nonlinearity on the boundary, in terms of the powers of their $H^1(\Om)$ norms. To prove our result, we combine in a novel way Moser type estimates together with elliptic regularity and Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality. We illustrate our result with an application to subcritical problems satisfying Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition.</description>

      <title>Bubbling and quantitative stability for Alexandrov's Soap Bubble Theorem with $L^1$-type deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative analysis of bubbling phenomena for almost constant mean curvature boundaries is an important question having significant applications in various fields including capillarity theory and the study of mean curvature flows. Such a quantitative analysis was initiated in [G. Ciraolo and F. Maggi, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. (2017)], where the first quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii was obtained in terms of a uniform deviation of the mean curvature from being constant. Weakening the measure of the deviation in such a result is a delicate issue that is crucial in view of the applications for mean curvature flows. Some progress in this direction was recently made in [V. Julin and J. Niinikoski, Anal. PDE (2023)], where $L^{N-1}$-deviations are considered for domains in $\mathbb{R}^N$. In the present paper we significantly weaken the measure of the deviation, obtaining a quantitative result of proximity to a set of disjoint balls of equal radii for the following deviation $$ \int_{\partial \Omega } \left( H_0 - H \right)^+ dS_x, \quad \text{ where } \begin{cases} H \text{ is the mean curvature of } \partial \Omega , \\ H_0:=\frac{| \partial \Omega |}{N | \Omega |} , \\ \left( H_0 - H \right)^+:=\max\left\lbrace H_0 - H , 0 \right\rbrace , \end{cases} $$ which is clearly even weaker than $\Vert H_0-H \Vert_{L^1( \partial \Omega )}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of two layers of immiscible, inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational fluids through a full nonlinear system. Our goal is to establish a virial theorem and prove the polynomial growth of slope and curvature of the interface over time when the fluid below is no denser than the one above. These phenomena, known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, will be proved for a broad class of regular initial data, including the case of 2D overlapping interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of an incompressible fluid with axial symmetry without swirl when the vorticity is sharply concentrated on $N$ annuli of radii of the order of $r_0$ and thickness $\varepsilon$. We prove that when $r_0= |\log \varepsilon|^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;1$, the vorticity field of the fluid converges for $\varepsilon \to 0$ to the point vortex model, in an interval of time which diverges as $\log|\log\varepsilon|$. This generalizes previous result by Cavallaro and Marchioro in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 053102, (2021)], that assumed $\alpha&gt;2$ and in which the convergence was proved for short times only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider classical steady water waves with a free surface, a flat bottom and constant vorticity $\gamma$. In the adverse case $\gamma&gt;0$ we prove that there is an absolute upper bound on the amplitude, independent of the physical constants, provided that $\gamma$ is sufficiently small. In any favorable case $\gamma\leq0$ we present a new proof of such an absolute bound on the amplitude and prove that the amplitude tends to zero as $\gamma$ tends to negative infinity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of long-range interactions in non-convex one-dimensional lattice systems in the simplified yet meaningful assumption that the relevant long-range interactions are between $M$-neighbours for some $M\ge 2$ and are convex. If short-range interactions are non-convex we then have a competition between short-range oscillations and long-range ordering. In the case of a double-well nearest-neighbour potential, thanks to a recent result by Braides, Causin, Solci and Truskinovsky, we are able to show that such a competition generates $M$-periodic minimizers whose arrangements are driven by an interfacial energy. Given $M$, the shape of such minimizers is universal, and independent of the details of the energies, but the number and shapes of such minimizers increases as $M$ diverges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of transporting one probability measure to another via an autonomous velocity field. We rely on tools from the theory of optimal transport. In one space-dimension, we solve a linear homogeneous functional equation to construct a suitable autonomous vector field that realizes the (unique) monotone transport map as the time-$1$ map of its flow. Generically, this vector field can be chosen to be Lipschitz continuous. We then use Sudakov's disintegration approach to deal with the multi-dimensional case by reducing it to a family of one-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>The Morse property of limit functions appearing in mean field equations on surfaces with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Morse property for functions related to limit functions of mean field equations on a smooth, compact surface $\Sigma$ with boundary $\partial\Sigma$. Given a Riemannian metric $g$ on $\Sigma$ we consider functions of the form
  \[
  f_g(x) := \sum_{i=1}^m\sigma_i^2R^g(x_i)+\sum_{i,j=1\\i\ne j}^m\sigma_i\sigma_jG^g(x_i,x_j)+h(x_1,\ldots,x_m),
  \]
  where $\sigma_i \neq 0$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$, $G^g$ is the Green function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(\Sigma,g)$ with Neumann boundary conditions, $R^g$ is the corresponding Robin function, and $h \in \mathcal{C}^{2}(\Sigma^m,\mathbb{R})$ is arbitrary. We prove that for any Riemannian metric $g$, there exists a metric $\widetilde g$ which is arbitrarily close to $g$ and in the conformal class of $g$ such that $f_{\widetilde g}$ is a Morse function. Furthermore we show that, if all $\sigma_i&gt;0$, then the set of Riemannian metrics for which $f_g$ is a Morse function is open and dense in the set of all Riemannian metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the prescribed mean curvature equation for $t$-graphs in a Riemannian Heisenberg group of arbitrary dimension. We characterize the existence of classical solutions in a bounded domain without imposing Dirichlet boundary data, and we provide conditions that guarantee uniqueness. Moreover, we extend previous results to solve the Dirichlet problem when the mean curvature is non-constant. Finally, by an approximation technique, we obtain solutions to the sub-Riemannian prescribed mean curvature equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal epidemic control by social distancing and vaccination of an infection structured by time since infection: the covid-19 case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the issue of COVID-19 mitigation, in this work we tackle the general problem of optimally controlling an epidemic outbreak of a communicable disease structured by time since exposure, by the aid of two types of control instruments namely, social distancing and vaccination by a vaccine at least partly effective in protecting from infection. Effective vaccines are assumed to be made available only in a subsequent period of the epidemic so that - in the first period - epidemic control only relies on social distancing, as it happened for the COVID-19 pandemic. By our analyses, we could prove the existence of (at least) one optimal control pair, we derived first-order necessary conditions for optimality, and proved some useful properties of such optimal solutions. A worked example provides a number of further insights on the relationships between key control and epidemic parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.07517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a continuous ocking Cucker-Smale model with noise, which has isotropic and polarized stationary solutions depending on the intensity of the noise. The first result establishes the threshold value of the noise parameter which drives the phase transition. This threshold value is used to classify all stationary solutions and their linear stability properties. Using an entropy, these stability properties are extended to the non-linear regime. The second result is concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions of the evolution problem. In several cases, we prove that stable solutions attract the other solutions with an optimal exponential rate of convergence determined by the spectral gap of the linearized problem around the stable solutions. The spectral gap has to be computed in a norm adapted to the non-local term.</description>

Surprisingly, we are able to discover such an ODE for the fractional Lane-Emden-Serrin equation, and therefore give a short classification for the precise local behavior of its solutions up to the second order involving a double logarithm. This seems to be the first time that a nonlocal equation is associated to a genuinely local ODE in one dimension. New non-existence, existence and multiplicity results for the corresponding Dirichlet problem are also discussed.
  Moreover, we construct complete $s$-fractional Yamabe metrics in $\mathbb{R}^n$ which are singular along a smooth submanifold of dimension $(n-2s)/2$, via direct integral asymptotic analysis with global geometric weights. This covers the missing borderline case as suggested by the deep work of Schoen and Yau. While such dimension is maximal in the class of distributional solutions, we conjecture the existence of complete metrics, understood in a suitably generalized sense, with prescribed singularities of strictly higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem for time-dependent semilinear transport equations. We show that time-independent coefficients of both the linear (absorption or scattering coefficients) and nonlinear terms can be uniquely determined, in a stable way, from the boundary measurements by applying a linearization scheme and Carleman estimates for the linear transport equations. We establish results in both Euclidean and general geometry settings.</description>

      <title>Pointwise estimates for the fundamental solution of higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation in odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04969v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, for any odd $n$ and any integer $m\geq1$, we study the fundamental solution of the higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \mathrm{i}\partial_tu(x,t)=((-\Delta)^m+V(x))u(x,t), \quad t\in \mathbb{R},\,\,x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where $V$ is a real-valued potential with certain decay, smoothness, and spectral properties. Let $P_{ac}(H)$ denote the projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H=(-\Delta)^m+V$. Our main result says that $e^{-\mathrm{i} tH}P_{ac}(H)$ has integral kernel $K(t,x,y)$ satisfying \begin{equation*} |K(t, x,y)|\le C (1+|t|)^{-h}(1+|t|^{-\frac{n}{2 m}})\left(1+|t|^{-\frac{1}{2 m}}|x-y|\right)^{-\frac{n(m-1)}{2 m-1}},\quad t\neq0,\,x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where the constants $C, h&gt;0$, and $h$ can be specified by $m, n$ and the spectral property of $H$.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions of critical anisotropic Sobolev equation without the finite volume constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify all positive solutions of the critical anisotropic Sobolev equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta^{H}_{p}u = u^{p^{*}-1}, \ \ x\in \mathbb{R}^n \end{equation*} without the finite volume constraint for $n \geq 2$ and $\frac{(n+1)}{3} \leq p &lt; n$, where $p^{*} = \frac{np}{n-p}$ denotes the critical Sobolev exponent and $-\Delta^{H}_{p}=-div(H^{p-1}(\cdot)\nabla H(\cdot))$ denotes the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator. This result removes the finite volume assumption on the classification of critical anisotropic $p$-Laplace equation which was obtained by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in the literature \cite{CFR}. The method is based on constructing suitable vector fields integral inequality and using Newton's type inequality.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limit with Optimal Convergence Rate of Classical Solutions to the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the diffusion limit of the strong solution to the Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann (VMB) system with initial data near a global Maxwellian. By introducing a new decomposition of the solution to identify the essential components for generating the initial layer, we prove the convergence and establish the opitmal convergence rate of the classical solution to the VMB system to the solution of the Navier-Stokes-Maxwell system based on the spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent Flows and Their Applications in Parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel Systems Part I: Alternating Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel equations (PKS) subject to ambient flows. Without the ambient fluid flow, the equation is super-critical in three-dimension and has finite-time blow-up solutions with arbitrarily small $L^1$-mass. In this study, we show that a family of time-dependent alternating shear flows, inspired by the clever ideas of Tarek Elgindi, can suppress the chemotactic blow-up in these systems.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions for mixed local-nonlocal elliptic equations with singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will prove multiplicity results for the mixed local-nonlocal elliptic equation of the form \begin{eqnarray} \begin{split} -\Delta_pu+(-\Delta)_p^s u&amp;=\frac{\lambda}{u^{\gamma}}+u^r \text { in } \Omega, \\u&amp;&gt;0 \text{ in } \Omega,\\u&amp;=0 \text { in }\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \Omega; \end{split} \end{eqnarray} where \begin{equation*} (-\Delta )_p^s u(x)= c_{n,s}\operatorname{P.V.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))}{|x-y|^{n+sp}} d y, \end{equation*} and $-\Delta_p$ is the usual $p$-Laplace operator. Under the assumptions that $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with regular enough boundary, $p&gt;1$, $n&gt; p$, $s\in(0,1)$, $\lambda&gt;0$ and $r\in(p-1,p^*-1)$ where $p^*$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, we will show there exist at least two weak solutions to our problem for $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$ and some certain values of $\lambda$. Further, for every $\gamma&gt;0$, assuming strict convexity of $\Omega$, for $p=2$ and $s\in(0,1/2)$, we will show the existence of at least two positive weak solutions to the problem, for small values of $\lambda$, extending the result of \cite{garaingeometric}. Here $c_{n,s}$ is a suitable normalization constant, and $\operatorname{P.V.}$ stands for Cauchy Principal Value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02594v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compare in detail the linear and nonlinear approach to the Gravitational Waves Displacement and Velocity Memory (GWDM and GWVM) effects. We consider astrophysical situations that give rise to gravitational waves with GWVM effect, i.e. with a residual velocity (the so-called "velocity-coded memory") and discuss the possibility of future detection of the GWVM effect.</description>

      <title>Optimal shielding for Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To construct asymptotically-Euclidean Einstein's initial data sets, we introduce the localized seed-to-solution method, which projects from approximate to exact solutions of the Einstein constraints. The method enables us to glue together initial data sets in multiple asymptotically-conical regions, and in particular construct data sets that exhibit the gravity shielding phenomenon, specifically that are localized in a cone and exactly Euclidean outside of it. We achieve optimal shielding in the sense that the metric and extrinsic curvature { are controlled at a super-harmonic rate, regardless of how slowly they decay (even} beyond the standard ADM formalism), and the gluing domain can be a collection of arbitrarily narrow nested cones. We also uncover several notions of independent interest: silhouette functions, localized ADM modulator, and relative energy-momentum vector. An axisymmetric example is provided numerically.</description>
