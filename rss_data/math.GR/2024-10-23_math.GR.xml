      <title>Asphericity of cubical presentations: the general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable hypotheses, the coned-off spaces associated to $C(9)$ cubical small-cancellation presentations are aspherical, and use this to provide classifying spaces, or classifying spaces for proper actions, for their fundamental groups. Along the way, we show that the Cohen--Lyndon property holds for the subgroups of the fundamental group of a non-positively curved cube complex associated to a $C(9)$ cubical presentation, and thus obtain near-sharp upper and lower bounds for the (rational) cohomological dimension of these quotients.
  We apply these results to give an alternative construction of compact $K(\pi,1)$ for Artin groups with no labels in $\{3,4\}$, from which a new direct sum decomposition for their homology and cohomology with various coefficients above a certain dimension follows. We also address a question of Wise about the virtual torsion-freeness of cubical small-cancellation groups.</description>

      <title>On the Brunnian conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a primer number, $n \geq 3$ and integer. Let $f(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + \cdots +a_1 X + a_0 \in \mathbb{F}_p[X]$ be a primitive polynomial of degree $n$. Let $C_f$ be the companion matrix of $f(X)$, and $G$ the companion matrix of the polynomial $X^n-1$. Define $G_1 := C_f$ and $G_{k+1} = G G_k G^{-1}$ for $0 \leq k \leq n-1$. The so called ``Brunnian Conjecture'' states that: the general linear group $GL(n,p)$ is generated by $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n$. In this paper, we prove it for $p \geq 5$ and $n$ not divisible by $p-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct countably many isolated circular orders on the free products $G = F_{2n} \ast \mathbb{Z}_{m_1} \ast \cdots \ast \mathbb{Z}_{m_k}$ of cyclic groups. Moreover, we prove that these isolated circular orders are not the automorphic images of the others. By using these isolated circular orders, we also construct countably many isolated left orders on a certain central $\mathbb{Z}$-extension of $G$, which are not the automorphic images of the others.</description>

      <title>Finite presentability of outer automorphism groups of large-type Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected large-type Artin group $A_\Gamma$, we introduce a deformation space $\mathcal{D}$. If $\Gamma$ is triangle-free, or has all labels at least 6, we show that this space is canonical, in that it depends only on the isomorphism type of $A_\Gamma$, and admits an $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$-action. Using this action we conclude that $\mathrm{Out}(A_\Gamma)$ is finitely presentable. We emphasise that our proof can handle cases where $\Gamma$ has separating vertices, which were previously problematic.
  In fact, our proof works for all connected large-type Artin groups satisfying the technical condition of having rigid chunks. We conjecture that all connected large-type Artin groups have rigid chunks, and therefore finitely presented outer automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Inner and Outer Twisted Derivations of Cyclic Group Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study twisted derivations of cyclic group rings. Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity, $G$ be a finite cyclic group, and ($\sigma, \tau$) be a pair of $R$-algebra endomorphisms of the group algebra $RG$, which are $R$-linear extensions of the group endomorphisms of $G$. In this article, we give two characterizations concerning $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the group ring $RG$. First, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation of $RG$ to be inner. Second, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an $R$-linear map $D: RG \rightarrow RG$ with $D(1) = 0$ to be a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation. We also illustrate our theorems with the help of examples. As a consequence of these two characterizations, we answer the well-known twisted derivation problem for $RG$: Under what conditions are all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of $RG$ inner? Or is the space of outer $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations trivial? More precisely, we give a sufficient condition under which all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of $RG$ are inner and a sufficient condition under which $RG$ has non-trivial outer $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations. Our result helps in generating several examples of non-trivial outer derivations.</description>

      <title>Coamenability and cospectral radius for orbit equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider inclusions $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$ of discrete, probability measure-preserving orbit equivalence relations. In previous work with Ab\'{e}rt-Fra\c{c}zyk, we established the pointwise almost sure existence of the cospectral radius of a random walk on the $\mathcal{R}$-classes. In this paper, we investigate the connections of this cospectral radius to the coamenability of the inclusion $\mathcal{S}\leq \mathcal{R}$. We also undertake a systematic study of coamenability for inclusions of relations, establishing several equivalence formulations of this notion.</description>

      <title>The relatively universal cover of the natural embedding of the long root geometry for the group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long root geometry $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$ admits an embedding in the (projective space of) the vector space of the traceless square matrices of order $n+1$ with entries in the field $\mathbb{K}$, usually regarded as the {\em natural} embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$. S. Smith and H. V\"{o}lklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{K})$, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127) have proved that the natural embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ is relatively universal if and only if $\mathbb{K}$ is either algebraic over its minimal subfield or perfect with positive characteristic. They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The ``if" part of Smith-V\"{o}lklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by V\"{o}lklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. V\"{o}lklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\mathbb{K}$ over ${\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = p &gt; 0$). Accordingly, both the ``if" and the ``only if" part of Smith-V\"{o}lklein's result hold true for every $n \geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We show that the complex of partial bases of the free group of rank $n$, where vertices are seen up to conjugation, is Cohen--Macaulay of dimension $n-1$. This positively answers a conjecture raised by Day and Putman. We prove our results in the more general context of freely decomposable groups.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in soluble arithmetic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reidemeister numbers of group automorphisms encode the number of twisted conjugacy classes of groups and might yield information about self-maps of spaces related to the given objects. Here we address a question posed by Gon\c{c}alves and Wong in the mid 2000s: we construct an infinite series of compact connected solvmanifolds (that are not nilmanifolds) of strictly increasing dimensions and all of whose self-homotopy equivalences have vanishing Nielsen number. To this end, we establish a sufficient condition for a prominent (infinite) family of soluble linear groups to have the so-called property $R_\infty$. In particular, we generalize or complement earlier results due to Dekimpe, Gon\c{c}alves, Kochloukova, Nasybullov, Taback, Tertooy, Van den Bussche, and Wong, showing that many soluble $S$-arithmetic groups have $R_\infty$ and suggesting a conjecture in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce several approaches to studying the Cantor-Bendixson decomposition of and the dynamics on the (topological) space of subgroups for various families of countable groups.
  In particular, we uncover the perfect kernel and the Cantor-Bendixson rank of the space of subgroups of many new groups, including for instance infinitely ended groups, limit groups, hyperbolic 3-manifold groups and many graphs of groups. We also study the topological dynamics of the conjugation action on the perfect kernel, establishing the conditions for topological transitivity and higher topological transitivity. As an application, we obtain many new examples of groups in the class A of Glasner and Monod, i.e. admitting faithful transitive amenable actions. This includes for example right-angled Artin groups, limit groups, finitely presented C'(1/6) small cancellation groups, random groups at density d&lt;1/6, and more generally all virtually compact special groups.</description>

      <title>Profinite Subgroup Accessibility and Recognition of Amalgamated Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate accessible subgroups of a profinite group $G$, i.e. subgroups $H$ appearing as vertex groups in a graph of profinite groups decomposition of $G$ with finite edge groups. We prove that any accessible subgroup $H \leq G$ arises as the kernel of a continuous derivation of $G$ in a free module over its completed group algebra. This allows us to deduce splittings of an abstract group from splittings of its profinite completion. We prove that any finitely generated subgroup $\Delta$ of a finitely generated virtually free group $\Gamma$ whose closure is a factor in a profinite amalgamated product $\widehat{\Gamma} = \overline{\Delta} \amalg_K L$ along a finite $K$ must be a factor in an amalgamated product $\Gamma = \Delta \ast_\chi \Lambda$ along some $\chi \cong K$. This extends previous results of Parzanchevski--Puder, Wilton and Garrido--Jaikin-Zapirain on free factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02264v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the natural density (among the positive integers) of the set of orders of the finite quotients of any ordinary triangle group is zero. This is achieved using methods inspired by a 1976 theorem of Bertram on large cyclic subgroups of finite groups and an application of the Turan-Kubilius inequality from asymptotic number theory. The question of the natural density of the set of finite quotient orders of triangle groups was first considered by Larson, then May and Zimmerman and then Tucker, who brought it to the author's attention.</description>

      <title>Sequential commutation in tracial von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recall that a unitary in a tracial von Neumann algebra is Haar if $\tau(u^n)=0$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We introduce and study a new Borel equivalence relation $\sim_N$ on the set of Haar unitaries in a diffuse tracial von Neumann algebra $N$. Two Haar unitaries $u,v$ in $\mathcal{U}(N)$ are related if there exists a finite path of sequentially commuting Haar unitaries in an ultrapower $N^\mathcal{U}$, beginning at $u$ and ending at $v$. We show that for any diffuse tracial von Neumann algebra $N$, the equivalence relation $\sim_N$ admits either 1 orbit or uncountably many orbits. We characterize property Gamma in terms of path length and number of orbits of $\sim_N$ and also show the existence of non-Gamma II$_1$ factors so that $\sim_N$ admits only 1 orbit. Examples where $\sim_N$ admits uncountably many orbits include $N$ having positive 1-bounded entropy: $h(N)&gt;0$. As a key example, we explicitly describe $\sim_{L(\mathbb{F}_t)}$ for the free group factors. Using these ideas we introduce a numerical invariant for diffuse tracial von Neumann algebras called the commutation diameter, with applications to elementary equivalence classification. We compute lower and upper bounds for the commutation diameter in various examples. Notably we obtain non-trivial lower bounds for the family of arbitrary graph products $N$ of diffuse tracial von Neumann algebras whose underlying graph is connected and has diameter at least 4, and distinguish them up to elementary equivalence from the [CIKE23] exotic factors, despite satisfying $h(N)\leq 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address two variants of the classical necklace counting problem from enumerative combinatorics. In both cases, we fix a finite group $\mathcal{G}$ and a positive integer $n$. In the first variant, we count the ``identity-product $n$-necklaces'' -- that is, the orbits of $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ that satisfy $a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n = 1$ under cyclic rotation. In the second, we count the orbits of all $n$-tuples $\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) \in \mathcal{G}^n$ under cyclic rotation and left multiplication (i.e., the operation of $\mathcal{G}$ on $\mathcal{G}^n$ given by $h \cdot \left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right) = \left(ha_1, ha_2, \ldots, ha_n\right)$). We prove bijectively that both answers are the same, and express them as a sum over divisors of $n$.
  Consequently, we generalize the first problem to $n$-necklaces whose product of entries lies in a given subset of $\mathcal{G}$ (closed under conjugation), and we connect a particular case to the enumeration of irreducible polynomials over a finite field with given degree and second-highest coefficient $0$.</description>
