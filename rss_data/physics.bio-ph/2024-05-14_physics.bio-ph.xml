      <title>Magnetic Relaxometry of Hemoglobin by Widefield Nitrogen-Vacancy Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hemoglobin (Hb) is a multifaceted protein, classified as a metalloprotein, chromoprotein, and globulin. It incorporates iron, which plays a crucial role in transporting oxygen within red blood cells. Hb functions by carrying oxygen from the respiratory organs to diverse tissues in the body, where it releases oxygen to fuel aerobic respiration, thus supporting the organism's metabolic processes. Deviations in Hb concentration in the blood have been linked to various medical conditions, including anemia and other blood disorders. Here, we use optical detected magnetic relaxometry of paramagnetic iron spins in Hb drop-casted onto nanostructured diamond doped with shallow (~ 5.5 nm) high density nitrogen vacancy (NV) spin qubits. We modify the Hb concentration in the range of 6 x 10^6 to 1.8 x 10^7 adsorbed Fe+3 spins per um^2 and observe an increase of the NV relaxation rate G1 (= 1/ T1, T1 is NV spin lattice relaxation time) up to 2 x 10^3 s^-1. NV magnetic relaxometry of Hb in phosphate-buffered saline solution show a similar effect with an increase of G1 to 6.7 x 10^3 s^-1 upon increasing the Hb concentration to 100 uM. The increase of NV G1 is explained by the increased spin noise coming from the Fe+3 spins present in Hb proteins. This study presents an additional usage of NV quantum sensors to detect paramagnetic centers in biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Influence of Organic Molecules and Phosphate Ions on the Formation of Biosilica Patterns in Diatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of regularly structured silica valves in diatoms is a captivating process in biomineralization. Specific organic molecules, including long-chain polyamines, silaffins, and silacidins, have been found to be essential in this process. The molecular structure of synthesized polyamines greatly affects the quantity, size, and shape of silica precipitates. Experimental findings indicate that silica precipitation occurs at specific concentrations of phosphate ions, with higher concentrations resulting in larger aggregates of organic molecules that serve as templates for silica formation.
  Our study focuses on the hypothesis that pattern formation in diatom valve structures is driven by the phase separation of species-specific organic molecules, with the evolving organic structures acting as templates for silica deposition. We specifically investigate the role of phosphate ions in the self-assembly of long-chain polyamines and analyze how their reaction with organic molecules impacts the morphology of the organic template. By varying the model parameters, including degree of dissociation and initial concentrations of reacting components, we show that the resulting geometric features of the patterns are highly dependent on these factors.
  Furthermore, we explore the scenario where an initial array of organic droplets serves as a static template for silica deposition, considering the effects of "prepatterning" by the silica costae in the base layer. We obtain numerical solutions that generate a diverse range of two-dimensional patterns closely resembling the valve structures observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality reduction in bulk-boundary reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular protein patterns regulate many vital cellular functions, such as the processing of spatiotemporal information or the control of shape deformations. To do so, pattern-forming systems can be sensitive to the cell geometry by means of coupling the protein dynamics on the cell membrane to dynamics in the cytosol. Recent studies demonstrated that modeling the cytosolic dynamics in terms of an averaged protein pool disregards possibly crucial aspects of the pattern formation, most importantly concentration gradients normal to the membrane. At the same time, the coupling of two domains (surface and volume) with different dimensions renders many standard tools for the numerical analysis of self-organizing systems inefficient. Here, we present a generic framework for projecting the cytosolic dynamics onto the lower-dimensional surface that respects the influence of cytosolic concentration gradients in static and evolving geometries. This method uses a priori physical information about the system to approximate the cytosolic dynamics by a small number of dominant characteristic concentration profiles (basis), akin to basis transformations of finite element methods. As a proof of concept, we apply our framework to a toy model for volume-dependent interrupted coarsening, evaluate the accuracy of the results for various basis choices, and discuss the optimal basis choice for biologically relevant systems. Our analysis presents an efficient yet accurate method for analysing pattern formation with surface-volume coupling in evolving geometries.</description>

      <title>Effects of skull properties on transcranial focused ultrasound transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial focused ultrasound can deliver energy to the brain in a minimally invasive manner for a variety of clinical applications. However, acoustic inhomogeneities within the skull cause significant wave interactions, leading to difficulties in predicting the energy delivered to the target. We present a comprehensive examination of intracranial acoustic fields generated by focused ultrasound transducers and assess the characteristics of cranial bone that affect acoustic transmission. Acoustic field maps were generated at 88 regions of interest across 10 historical and 2 Thiel-embalmed human skull specimens with sonication at frequencies of 220 kHz, 650 kHz, and 1000 kHz. The average peak pressure attenuation was $3.1 \pm 1.4$ dB, $9.0 \pm 1.7$ dB, and $14.6 \pm 4.1$ dB, respectively. The average power attenuation was $5.0 \pm 2.4$ dB, $14.9 \pm 3.2$ dB, and $24.1 \pm 6.3$ dB, respectively. The effect of skull thickness, skull density ratio, and skull curvature on intracranial peak pressure and power was investigated and linear fits produced. Our results demonstrate that Thiel-embalmed samples fall within the confidence intervals of fits for historical samples. The effects of angulation and spacing between the transducer and the skull were also investigated. Results indicate that wave superposition resulting from skull and transducer spacing could lead to a 30-40% uncertainty in peak recorded intracranial pressure.</description>
