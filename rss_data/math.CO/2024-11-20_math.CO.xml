      <title>Stack-Sorting with Dotted-Pattern-Avoiding Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the dotted pattern-avoiding map $s_{\dot{\tau}}$, which avoids the dotted pattern $\dot{\tau}$ instead of descents as West's stack-sorting map $s$ does. We also extend the pattern-avoiding machine, which is composed of a $\sigma$ avoiding map and West's stack-sorting map $s$, to the dotted pattern-avoiding machine. In this paper, we prove the analogs of the classical results on West's stack sorting map for the length $2$ dotted pattern-avoiding maps. We end with several conjectures.</description>

      <title>Promotion, Tangled Labelings, and Sorting Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Defant and Kravitz's generalization of Sch\"utzenberger's promotion operator to arbitrary labelings of finite posets in two directions. Defant and Kravitz showed that applying the promotion operator $n-1$ times to a labeling of a poset on $n$ elements always gives a natural labeling of the poset and called a labeling tangled if it requires the full $n-1$ promotions to reach a natural labeling. They also conjectured that there are at most $(n-1)!$ tangled labelings for any poset on $n$ elements. In the first direction, we propose a further strengthening of their conjecture by partitioning tangled labelings according to the element labeled $n-1$ and prove that this stronger conjecture holds for inflated rooted forest posets and a new class of posets called shoelace posets. In the second direction, we introduce sorting generating functions and cumulative generating functions for the number of labelings that require $k$ applications of the promotion operator to give a natural labeling. We prove that the coefficients of the cumulative generating function of the ordinal sum of antichains are log-concave and obtain a refinement of the weak order on the symmetric group.</description>

      <title>A note on the mutual-visibility coloring of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $M$ of vertices in a graph $G$ is a mutual-visibility set if for any two vertices $u,v\in{M}$ there exists a shortest $u$-$v$ path in $G$ that contains no elements of $M$ as internal vertices. Let $\chi_{\mu}(G)$ be the least number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$, so that each color class is a mutual-visibility set. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $Q_{n}$ be an $n$-dimensional hypercube. It has been shown that the maximum size of a mutual-visibility set in $Q_{n}$ is at least $\Omega(2^{n})$. Klav\v{z}ar, Kuziak, Valenzuela-Tripodoro, and Yero further asked whether it is true that $\chi_{\mu}(Q_{n})=O(1)$. In this note we answer their question in the negative by showing that $$\omega(1)=\chi_{\mu}(Q_{n})=O(\log\log{n}).$$</description>

      <title>Topological cliques in sparse expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we focus on embedding clique immersions and subdivisions within sparse expanders, and we derive the following main results: (1) For any $0&lt; \eta&lt; 1/2$, there exists $K&gt;0$ such that for sufficiently large $n$, every $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ contains a $K_{(1-5\eta)d}$-immersion when $d\geq K\lambda$. (2) For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\eta &lt;1/2$, the following holds for sufficiently large $n$. Every $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph $G$ with $2048\lambda/\eta^2&lt;d\leq \eta n^{1/2-\varepsilon}$ contains a $K_{(1-\eta)d}^{(\ell)}$-subdivision, where $\ell = 2 \left\lceil \log(\eta^2n/4096)\right\rceil + 5$. (3) There exists $c&gt;0$ such that the following holds for sufficiently large $d$. If $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with average degree $d(G)\geq d$, then $G$ contains a $K_{c d}^{(\ell)}$-immersion for some $\ell\in \mathbb{N}$.
  In 2018, Dvo{\v{r}}{\'a}k and Yepremyan asked whether every graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq t$ contains a $K_t$-immersion. Our first result shows that it is asymptotically true for $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs when $\lambda=o(d)$. In addition, our second result extends a result of Dragani{\'c}, Krivelevich and Nenadov on balanced subdivisions. The last result generalises a result of DeVos, Dvo{\v{r}}{\'a}k, Fox, McDonald, Mohar, Scheide on $1$-immersions of large cliques in dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of generalized orthogonal polynomials of type $R_{II}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Ismail and Masson introduced orthogonal polynomials of types \( R_I \) and \( R_{II} \), which are defined by specific three-term recurrence relations with additional conditions. Recently, Kim and Stanton found a combinatorial interpretation for the moments of orthogonal polynomials of type \( R_I \) in the spirit of the combinatorial theory of orthogonal polynomials due to Flajolet and Viennot. In this paper, we push this combinatorial model further to orthogonal polynomials of type \( R_{II} \). Moreover, we generalize orthogonal polynomials of type \( R_{II} \) by relaxing some of their conditions. We then prove a master theorem, which generalizes combinatorial models for moments of various types of orthogonal polynomials: classical orthogonal polynomials, Laurent biorthogonal polynomials, and orthogonal polynomials of types \( R_I \) and \( R_{II} \).</description>

      <title>The subgraph eigenvector centrality of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $F$ be a connected subgraph of $G$ with a given structure. We consider that the centrality of a vertex $i$ of $G$ is determined by the centrality of other vertices in all subgraphs contain $i$ and isomorphic to $F$. In this paper we propose an $F$-subgraph tensor and an $F$-subgraph eigenvector centrality of $G$. When the graph is $F$-connected, we show that the $F$-subgraph tensor is weakly irreducible, and in this case, the $F$-subgraph eigenvector centrality exists. Specifically, when we choose $F$ to be a path $P_1$ of length $1$(or a complete graph $K_2$), the $F$-eigenvector centrality is eigenvector centrality of $G$. Furthermore, we propose the $(K_2,F)$-subgraph eigenvector centrality of $G$ and prove it always exists when $G$ is connected. Specifically, the $P_2$-subgraph eigenvector centrality and $(K_2,F)$-subgraph eigenvector centrality are studied. Some examples show that the ranking of vertices under them differs from the rankings under several classic centralities. Vertices of a regular graph have the same eigenvector centrality scores. But the $(K_2,K_3)$-subgraph eigenvector centrality can distinguish vertices in a given regular graph.</description>

      <title>The Chain Matrix of Bouquets of Geometric Lattices and its Determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work builds on Varchenko et al's introduction of bilinear forms for hyperplane arrangements, where the determinant of the associated matrices factorizes into simple components. While one of the determinant formula developed by Varchenko has been generalized to complexes of oriented matroids (COMs) already, this question was open for another, distinct form. Motivated by work from Varchenko and Brylawski, who generalized the alternative bilinear form and its determinant formula from hyperplane arrangements to matroids, we examine whether this formula can similarly be generalized to COMs. Our findings affirm this generalization, and we further extend the determinant formula to bouquets of geometric lattices as introduced by Laurent et al.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration Using Generalized Token Jumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reconfiguration, we are given two solutions to a graph problem, such as Vertex Cover or Dominating Set, with each solu tion represented by a placement of tokens on vertices of the graph. Our task is to reconfigure one into the other using small steps while ensuring the intermediate configurations of tokens are also valid solutions. The two commonly studied settings are Token Jumping and Token Sliding, which allows moving a single token to an arbitrary or an adjacent vertex, respectively.
  We introduce new rules that generalize Token Jumping, parameterized by the number of tokens allowed to move at once and by the maximum distance of each move. Our main contribution is identifying minimal rules that allow reconfiguring any possible given solution into any other for Independent Set, Vertex Cover, and Dominating Set. For each minimal rule, we also provide an efficient algorithm that finds a corresponding reconfiguration sequence.
  We further focus on the rule that allows each token to move to an adjacent vertex in a single step. This natural variant turns out to be the minimal rule that guarantees reconfigurability for Vertex Cover. We determine the computational complexity of deciding whether a (shortest) reconfiguration sequence exists under this rule for the three studied problems. While reachability for Vertex Cover is shown to be in P, finding a shortest sequence is shown to be NP-complete. For Independent Set and Dominating Set, even reachability is shown to be PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity spectrum of join of central graphs and Eccentricity Wiener index of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eccentricity matrix of a simple connected graph is derived from its distance matrix by preserving the largest non-zero distance in each row and column, while the other entries are set to zero. This article examines the $\epsilon$-spectrum, $\epsilon$-energy, $\epsilon$-inertia and irreducibility of the central graph (respectively complement of the central graph) of a triangle-free regular graph(respectively regular graph). Also look into the $\epsilon-$spectrum and the irreducibility of different central graph operations, such as central vertex join, central edge join, and central vertex-edge join. We also examine the $\epsilon-$ energy of some specific graphs. These findings allow us to construct new families of $\epsilon$-cospectral graphs and non $\epsilon$-cospectral $\epsilon-$equienergetic graphs. Additionally, we investigate certain upper and lower bounds for the eccentricity Wiener index of graphs. Also, provide an upper bound for the eccentricity energy of a self-centered graph.</description>

      <title>Generation of Cycle Permutation Graphs and Permutation Snarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for the efficient generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic cycle permutation graphs, i.e. cubic graphs with a $2$-factor consisting of two chordless cycles, and non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs, from which the permutation snarks can easily be computed. This allows us to generate all cycle permutation graphs up to order $34$ and all permutation snarks up to order $46$, improving upon previous computational results by Brinkmann et al. Moreover, we give several improved lower bounds for interesting permutation snarks, such as for a smallest permutation snark of order $6 \bmod 8$ or a smallest permutation snark of girth at least $6$. These computational results also allow us to complete a characterisation of the orders for which non-hamiltonian cycle permutation graphs exist, answering an open question by Klee from 1972, and yield many more counterexamples to a conjecture by Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $(c,t)$-sparse if for every pair of vertex subsets $A,B\subset V(G)$ with $|A|,|B|\geq t$, $e(A,B)\leq (1-c)|A||B|$. In this paper we prove that for every $c&gt;0$ and integer $\ell$, there exists $C&gt;1$ such that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ is $(c,t)$-sparse for some $t$, and has at least $C t^{1-1/\ell}n^{1+1/\ell}$ edges, then $G$ contains an induced copy of $C_{2\ell}$. This resolves a conjecture of Fox, Nenadov and Pham.</description>

      <title>Improvements on Permutation Reconstruction from Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reconstruction problem of permutation sequences from their $k$-minors, which are subsequences of length $k$ with entries renumbered by $1,2,\ldots,k$ preserving order. We prove that the minimum number $k$ such that any permutation of length $n$ can be reconstructed from the multiset of its $k$-minors is between $\exp{(\Omega(\sqrt{\ln n}))}$ and $O(\sqrt{n\ln n})$. These results imply better bounds of a well-studied parameter $N_d$, which is the smallest number such that any permutation of length $n\ge N_d$ can be reconstructed by its $(n-d)$-minors. The new bounds are $ d+\exp(\Omega(\sqrt{\ln d}))&lt;N_d&lt;d+O(\sqrt{d\ln d})$ asymptotically, and the previous bounds were $d+\log_2 d&lt;N_d&lt;d^2/4+2d+4$.</description>

      <title>Scattered polynomials: an overview on their properties, connections and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to outline the state of the art in research on a class of linearized polynomials with coefficients over finite fields, known as scattered polynomials. These have been studied in several contexts, such as in [A. Blokhuis, M. Lavrauw. Scattered spaces with respect to a spread in $\mathrm{PG}(n, q)$. Geometriae Dedicata 81(1) (2000), 231-243] and [G. Lunardon, O. Polverino. Blocking sets and derivable partial spreads. J. Algebraic Combin. 14 (2001), 49-56]. Recently, their connection to maximum rank-metric codes was brought to light in [J. Sheekey. MRD codes: Constructions and connections. In K.-U. Schmidt and A. Winterhof, editors, Combinatorics and Finite Fields, De Gruyter (2019), 255-286]. This link has significantly advanced their study and investigation, sparking considerable interest in recent years. Here, we will explore their relationship with certain subsets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ known as maximum scattered linear sets, as well as with codes made up of square matrices of order $n$ equipped with the rank metric. We will review the known examples of scattered polynomials up to date and discuss some of their key properties. We will also address the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of the finite projective line $\mathrm{PG}(1, q^n)$ for small values of $n$ and discuss characterization results for the examples known so far. Finally, we will retrace how each scattered polynomial gives rise to a translation plane, as discussed in [V. Casarino, G. Longobardi, C. Zanella. Scattered linear sets in a finite projective line and translation planes, Linear Algebra Appl. 650 (2022), 286-298] and in [G. Longobardi, C. Zanella, A standard form for scattered linearized polynomials and properties of the related translation planes, J. Algebr. Comb. 59(4) (2024), 917-937].</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short survey we concern ourselves with minimal codes, a classical object in coding theory. We will explain the relation between minimal codes and various other mathematical domains, in particular with finite projective geometry. This latter connection has sparked a renewed interest in minimal codes, giving rise to new constructions as well as new questions.</description>

      <title>Sharp Poincare-Wirtinger inequalities on complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K_n=(V,E)$ be the complete graph with $n\geq 3$ vertices (here $V$ and $E$ denote the set of vertices and edges of $K_n$ respectively). We find the optimal value ${\bf{C}}_{n,p}$ such that the inequality $$\|f-m_f\|_p\le {\bf C}_{n,p}{\rm Var}_{p}f$$ holds for every $f:V\to \mathbb{R},$ where ${\rm Var}_p$ stands for the $p$-variation, and $m_f$ stands for the average value of $f$, for all $p\in[1,3+\delta^1_n)\cup (3+\delta^2_n,+\infty)$, for $\delta^1_n=\frac{1}{2n^2\log(n)}+O(1/n^3)$ and $\delta^2_n=\frac{2}{n}+O(1/n^2).$ Moreover, we characterize all the maximizer functions in that case. The behavior of the maximizers is different in each of the intervals $(1,2)$, $(2,3+\delta^{1}_n)$ and $(3+\delta^{2}_n,\infty).$</description>

      <title>Edge universality of $\beta$-additions through Dunkl operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the edge limit of Gaussian/Laguerre Beta ensembles is given by Airy($\beta$) point process. We prove an universality result that this also holds for a general class of additions of Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles. In order to make sense of $\beta$-addition, we introduce type A Bessel function as the characteristic function of our matrix ensemble following the line of Gorin-Marcus, Benaych Georges-Cuenca-Gorin. Then we extract its moment information through the action of Dunkl operators, a class of differential operators originated from special function theory. We do the action explicitly on the Bessel generating functions of our additions, and after the asymptotic analysis, we obtain certain limiting functional in terms of conditional Brownian bridges of the Laplace transform of Airy($\beta$), which is universal up to proper rescaling among all our additions.</description>

      <title>Multipacking in Euclidean Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of multipacking problems for geometric point sets with respect to their Euclidean distances. We consider a set of $n$ points $P$ and define $N_s[v]$ as the subset of $P$ that includes the $s$ nearest points of $v \in P$ and the point $v$ itself. We assume that the \emph{$s$-th neighbor} of each point is unique, for every $s \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots , n-1\}$. For a natural number $r \leq n$, an $r$-multipacking is a set $ M \subseteq P $ such that for each point $ v \in P $ and for every integer $ 1\leq s \leq r $, $|N_s[v]\cap M|\leq (s+1)/2$. The $r$-multipacking number of $ P $ is the maximum cardinality of an $r$-multipacking of $ P $ and is denoted by $ \MP_{r}(P) $. For $r=n-1$, an $r$-multipacking is called a multipacking and $r$-multipacking number is called as multipacking number. We study the problem of computing a maximum $r$-multipacking for point sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that a maximum $1$-multipacking can be computed in polynomial time but computing a maximum $2$-multipacking is NP complete. Further, we provide approximation and parameterized solutions to the $2$-multipacking problem.</description>

      <title>Relative Lonely Runner spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a subtorus $T \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, let $D(T)$ denote the $L^\infty$-distance from $T$ to the point $(1/2, \ldots, 1/2)$. For a subtorus $U \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$, define $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$, the Lonely Runner spectrum relative to $U$, to be the set of all values of $D(T)$ as $T$ ranges over the $1$-dimensional subtori of $U$ not contained in the union of the coordinate hyperplanes of $(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$. The relative spectrum $\mathcal{S}_1((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n)$ is the ordinary Lonely Runner spectrum that has been studied previously.
  Giri and the second author recently showed that the relative spectra $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$ for $2$-dimensional subtori $U \subseteq (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n$ essentially govern the accumulation points of the Lonely Runner spectrum $\mathcal{S}_1((\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^n)$. In the present work, we prove that such relative spectra $\mathcal{S}_1(U)$ have a very rigid arithmetic structure, and that one can explicitly find a complete characterization of each such relative spectrum with a finite calculation; carrying out this calculation for a few specific examples sheds light on previous constructions in the literature on the Lonely Runner Problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proves a conjecture generated by the artificial intelligence conjecturing program called \emph{TxGraffiti}. More specifically, we show that if $G$ is a connected, cubic, and claw-free graph, then $Z(G) \le \gamma(G) + 2$, where $Z(G)$ and $\gamma(G)$ denote the zero forcing number and the domination number of $G$, respectively. Furthermore, we provide a complete characterization of graphs that achieve this bound. Notably, this bound improves the known upper bounds for the zero forcing number of connected, cubic, and claw-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Dual Ramsey degrees of relational structures over finite languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that some natural classes of relational structures have both dual small and dual big Ramsey degrees with respect to some natural classes of morphisms. We start by showing that the class of all finite relational structures over a finite relational language has dual small Ramsey degrees with respect to quotient maps, and that in the same setting projectively universal countably infinite structures have dual big Ramsey degrees. We then show that the same is true for some natural special cases such as graphs and posets (with respect to quotient maps) and metric spaces (with respect to non-expansive surjections). An important exception is the class of reflexive tournaments: they have neither dual small nor dual big Ramsey degrees. Our proof strategy is based on the categorical interpretation of structural Ramsey theory because the inherent duality of category theory facilitates the reasoning in the dual context.</description>

Abstract: Finite projective planes are constructed using groups that satisfy simple-looking conditions.
  The resulting projective planes include many known planes and possibly new ones, and are precisely those having a collineation group fixing a flag $(\infty,L_ \infty )$ and transitive on the flags $ (w,W )$ with $w\notin L_ \infty $ and $\infty\notin W$.</description>

Abstract: For each $n \geq 2$, $l \geq 3$, let ${ES}_L (l,n)$ be the minimum $N$ such that every family of $N$-lines in the plane contains either $l$ concurrent lines or $n$ lines in convex position.

      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>

Abstract: Suppose $0 &lt; p \le \infty$. For a simple graph $G$ with a vertex-degree sequence $d_1, \dots, d_n$ satisfying $(d_1^p + \dots + d_n^p)^{1/p} \le C$, we prove asymptotically sharp upper bounds on the number of $t$-cliques in $G$. This result bridges the $p = 1$ case, which is the notable Kruskal--Katona theorem, and the $p = \infty$ case, known as the Gan--Loh--Sudakov conjecture, and resolved by Chase. In particular, we demonstrate that the extremal construction exhibits a dichotomy between a single clique and multiple cliques at $p_0 = t - 1$. Our proof employs the entropy method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A randomly perturbed graph $G^p = G_\alpha \cup G(n,p)$ is obtained by taking a deterministic $n$-vertex graph $G_\alpha = (V, E)$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq \alpha n$ and adding the edges of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$ defined on the same vertex set $V$. For which value $p$ (depending on $\alpha$) does the graph $G^p$ contain a $K_r$-factor (a spanning collection of vertex-disjoint $K_r$-copies) with high probability? The order of magnitude of the minimal value of $p$ has been determined whenever $\alpha \neq 1- \frac{s}{r}$ for an integer $s$ (see Han, Morris, and Treglown [RSA, 2021] and Balogh, Treglown, and Wagner [CPC, 2019]).
  We establish the minimal probability $p_s$ (up to a constant factor) for all values of $\alpha = 1-\frac{s}{r} \leq \frac 12$, and show that the threshold exhibits a polynomial jump at $\alpha = 1-\frac{s}{r}$ compared to the surrounding intervals. An extremal example $G_{\alpha}$ which shows that $p_s$ is optimal up to a constant factor differs from the previous (usually multipartite) examples in containing a pseudorandom induced subgraph.</description>

      <title>Anti-Ramsey Number of Friendship Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An edge-colored graph is called \textit{rainbow graph} if all the colors on its edges are distinct. For a given positive integer $n$ and a family of graphs $\mathcal{G}$, the anti-Ramsey number $ar(n, \mathcal{G})$ is the smallest number of colors $r$ required to ensure that, no matter how the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ are colored using exactly $r$ colors, there will always be a rainbow copy of some graph $G$ from the family $\mathcal{G}$. A friendship graph $F_k$ is the graph obtained by combining $k$ triangles that share a common vertex. In this paper, we determine the anti-Ramsey number $ar(n, \{F_k\})$ for large values of $n$. Additionally, we also determine the $ar(n, \{K_{1,k}, kK_2\}$, where $K_{1,k}$ is a star graph with $ k+1$ vertices and $kK_2$ is a matching of size $k$.</description>

      <title>Coordinate rings of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties in the open opposite Schubert cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dale Peterson has discovered a surprising result that the quantum cohomology ring of the flag variety $\mbox{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})/B$ is isomorphic to the coordinate ring of the intersection of the Peterson variety $\mbox{Pet}_n$ and the opposite Schubert cell associated with the identity element $\Omega_e^\circ$ in $\mbox{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})/B$. This is an unpublished result, so papers of Kostant and Rietsch are referred for this result. An explicit presentation of the quantum cohomology ring of $\mbox{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})/B$ is given by Ciocan-Fontanine and Givental-Kim. In this paper we introduce further quantizations of their presentation so that they reflect the coordinate rings of the intersections of regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties $\mbox{Hess}(N,h)$ and $\Omega_e^\circ$ in $\mbox{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})/B$. In other words, we generalize the Peterson's statement to regular nilpotent Hessenberg varieties via the presentation given by Ciocan-Fontanine and Givental-Kim. As an application of our theorem, we show that the singular locus of the intersection of some regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety $\mbox{Hess}(N,h_m)$ and $\Omega_e^\circ$ is the intersection of certain Schubert variety and $\Omega_e^\circ$ where $h_m=(m,n,\ldots,n)$ for $1&lt;m&lt;n$. We also see that $\mbox{Hess}(N,h_2) \cap \Omega_e^\circ$ is related with the cyclic quotient singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a correspondence between the higher Bruhat orders of Yu. I. Manin and V. Schechtman, and the cup-$i$ coproducts defining Steenrod squares in cohomology. To any element of the higher Bruhat orders we associate a coproduct, recovering Steenrod's original ones from extremal elements in these orders. Defining this correspondence involves interpreting the coproducts geometrically in terms of zonotopal tilings, which allows us to give conceptual proofs of their properties and show that all reasonable coproducts arise from our construction.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of Lie algebras associated with graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14188v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a canonical decomposition of the cohomology of the Dani-Mainkar metabelian Lie algebras associated with graphs. As applications, we obtain explicit formulas for the third cohomology of any Dani-Mainkar Lie algebra and for the cohomology in all degrees of Lie algebras associated with arbitrary star graphs. We also describe a procedure to reduce the calculation of the cohomology of solvable Lie algebras associated with graphs through the Grantcharov-Grantcharov-Iliev construction to the cohomology of Dani-Mainkar Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Mathematically tractable models of random phylogenetic networks: an overview of some recent developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models of random phylogenetic networks have been used since the inception of the field, but the introduction and rigorous study of mathematically tractable models is a much more recent topic that has gained momentum in the last 5 years. This manuscript discusses some recent developments in the field through a selection of examples. The emphasis is on the techniques rather than on the results themselves, and on probabilistic tools rather than on combinatorial ones.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs $G$ with $m_G(\lambda)= 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04770v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in \mathbb{G}_{s}$ and $\lambda\notin \sigma(P_s)$.</description>
