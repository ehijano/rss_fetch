      <title>Perception-Limited Smooth Safety Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a smooth safety-filtering framework for nonlinear control-affine systems under limited perception. Classical Control Barrier Function (CBF) filters assume global availability of the safety function - its value and gradient must be known everywhere - an assumption incompatible with sensing-limited settings, and the resulting filters often exhibit nonsmooth switching when constraints activate. We propose two complementary perception-aware safety filters applicable to general control-invariant safety sets. The first introduces a smooth perception gate that modulates barrier constraints based on sensing range, yielding a closed-form Lipschitz-safe controller with forward-invariance guarantees. The second replaces the hard CBF constraint with a differentiable penalty term, leading to a smooth unconstrained optimization-based safety filter consistent with CBF principles. For both designs, we establish existence, uniqueness, and forward invariance of the closed-loop trajectories. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed smooth filters enable the synthesis of higher-order tracking controllers for systems such as drones and second-order ground robots, offering substantially smoother and more robust safety-critical behaviors than classical CBF-based filters.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Energy Scheduling of Multi-Microgrids Based on Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy, multi-microgrids play an increasingly important role in improving the flexibility and reliability of energy supply. Reinforcement learning has shown great potential in coordination strategies due to its model-free nature. Current methods lack explicit quantification of the relationship between individual and joint risk values, resulting in obscured credit assignment. Moreover, they often depend on explicit communication, which becomes inefficient as system complexity grows. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework with shared memory (RRL-SM) for multi-microgrid scheduling. Specifically, a risk-sensitive value factorization scheme is proposed to quantify the relationship between individual and joint risk values by leveraging distributional modeling and attention-based representations, thereby aligning local decisions with global risk objectives. An implicit shared-memory coordination mechanism is implemented through a global memory space to enhance the overall efficiency of decentralized decision-making. Collectively, the integrated approach delivers more reliable cooperative scheduling under renewable energy uncertainty. Simulation results show that RRL-SM reduces load-shedding risk by 84.5%, demonstrating a favorable balance between reliability and economic performance.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware 3D UAV Tracking Using Single-Anchor UWB Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we present an uncertainty-aware single-anchor Ultra-Wideband (UWB)-based 3D tracking framework. Specifically, a mobile Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) maintains a desired standoff distance to a moving target using range and 3D bearing measurements from a multi-antenna UWB anchor rigidly mounted on the UAV. To enhance the stability and safety under measurement degradation and motion uncertainty, we jointly design a robust factor-graph-based target localization method and a covariance-aware control Lyapunov function--control barrier function (CLF--CBF) tracking controller. This controller adaptively adjusts distance bounds and safety margins based on the posterior target covariance provided by the factor graph. The proposed system is evaluated through numerical simulations and real-world experiments carried out in a narrow indoor corridor environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-attribute decision-making problems where the attribute values are interval grey numbers, a simplified form based on kernels and the degree of greyness is presented. Combining fuzzy graph theory with the kernel and the degree of greyness of interval grey numbers, grey graphs and their corresponding operation rules are presented. This paper presents a new multi-attribute decision-making method based on grey graph theory. We analyzed and evaluated the alternative schemes using grey graph. Lastly, a numerical example was conducted in order to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Linear Attention for Joint Power Optimization and User-Centric Clustering in Cell-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal AP clustering and power allocation are critical in user-centric cell-free massive MIMO systems. Existing deep learning models lack flexibility to handle dynamic network configurations. Furthermore, many approaches overlook pilot contamination and suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight transformer model that overcomes these limitations by jointly predicting AP clusters and powers solely from spatial coordinates of user devices and AP. Our model is architecture-agnostic to users load, handles both clustering and power allocation without channel estimation overhead, and eliminates pilot contamination by assigning users to AP within a pilot reuse constraint. We also incorporate a customized linear attention mechanism to capture user-AP interactions efficiently and enable linear scalability with respect to the number of users. Numerical results confirm the model's effectiveness in maximizing the minimum spectral efficiency and providing near-optimal performance while ensuring adaptability and scalability in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dispatch-Aware Learning for Optimal Transmission Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transmission switching (OTS) improves optimal power flow (OPF) by selectively opening transmission lines, but its mixed-integer formulation increases computational complexity, especially on large grids. To deal with this, we propose a dispatch-aware deep neural network (DA-DNN) that accelerates DC-OTS without relying on pre-solved labels. DA-DNN predicts line states and passes them through an embedded differentiable DC-OPF layer, using the resulting generation cost as the loss function so that all physical network constraints are enforced throughout training and inference. In addition, we adopt a customized weight-bias initialization that keeps every forward pass feasible from the first iteration, which allows stable learning. Once trained, the proposed DA-DNN successfully produces a feasible topology and dispatch pair in the same time as solving the DCOPF, whereas conventional mixed-integer solvers become intractable. Moreover, the embedded OPF layer enables DA-DNN to generalize to untrained system configurations, such as changes in line flow limits. As a result, the proposed method successfully captures the economic advantages of OTS while maintaining scalability and generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Layer-to-layer Closed-loop Switched Heating and Cooling Control of the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the stabilization of interlayer temperature in the laser powder bed fusion process through a novel switched layer-to-layer closed-loop feedback controller. The controller architecture aims to measure the interlayer temperature by a laterally positioned thermal camera and maintain a preset reference temperature by switching between the heating mode through dynamic laser power adjustment and the cooling mode by assigning interlayer dwell time to allow cooling between layers. The switching controller employs a feedback optimization control algorithm for the heating mode to adjust the laser power, and a triggering algorithm that increases the interlayer dwell time until the interlayer temperature reaches the reference value. Additionally, the study compares the performance of the proposed controller in both supported and unsupported overhanging parts to evaluate the effect of support structures on the controller performance as well as the thermal behavior of overhanging parts. Results demonstrate the controller's effectiveness in stabilizing interlayer temperature across varying cross-sectional areas while remaining within the material's stable processing zone. In the heating mode, the controller efficiently stabilizes temperature, even in geometries with significant cross-section variation. The study also identifies trade-offs among process efficiency, energy consumption, and build time. Supported parts exhibit reduced overheating but consume more energy and material, while unsupported parts stabilize interlayer temperature faster but with longer build times due to increased dwell time assignments. The research highlights notable improvements in interlayer temperature control for geometries prone to excessive thermal stresses. Moreover, the introduction of interlayer dwell time offers a practical solution to maintaining thermal stability in complex geometries.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled ISAC: Towards On-Demand Sensing Services and Enhanced Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing-and-communication (ISAC) network enabled by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is supposed to fly along a periodical circular trajectory at a fixed height for ISAC service supply from the sky. We consider on-demand sensing services, where on-demand detection and on-demand localization requests may be activated at any time toward any position within the targeted serving region. While guaranteeing satisfactory accuracy for both on-demand sensing tasks, we aim at maximizing the minimum achievable throughput among all communication users, via joint optimizing the UAV trajectory and communication user scheduling. To address the complicated problem with infinite sensing constraints, we characterize the on-demand detection constraint as a restricted deployment area for UAV and the on-demand localization constraint as Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) constraints over finite reference target points, based on which the original problem is simplified to more tractable one. Afterwards, particularly aiming to ensure no violations of CRB constraints, we propose a convex approximation for the reformulated problem, where tight approximation is guaranteed at given local solution. The construction strategy for convex problem approximation allows an efficient iterative algorithm with verified convergence to a superior suboptimal solution. At last, with simulations, we verified the applicability of our developed optimization scheme in strictly fulfilling the on-demand sensing constraints and the effectiveness of our proposed solution for simultaneously enhancing the communication throughput in UAV-enabled ISAC.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Case Study of a Rural Local Electricity Community in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local Electricity Communities (communaut\'es \'electriques locales, CEL) will become operational in Switzerland in 2026, allowing prosumers, consumers, and storage operators within the same municipality and distribution system operator (DSO) area to exchange electricity over the public grid with reduced distribution tariffs. This report examines a rural Swiss case study to explore the techno-economic implications of CELs for both participants and the local DSO. The findings indicate that CELs can enhance the local use of renewable generation, particularly photovoltaics, and offer modest financial gains, with outcomes strongly shaped by community size, composition, and tariff design. Larger and more heterogeneous communities achieve better internal matching of supply and demand, though the overall incentive remains limited because the tariff reduction applies only to distribution charges. The study further shows that internal energy exchange is maximized when local PV generation covers roughly 1-2 times the community load. For DSOs, CELs reduce grid imports (27-46%), resulting in a substantial reduction in distribution tariff revenues (17-36%), necessitating regulatory adaptation. While centralized batteries provide economic value to members, their technical impact on the grid remains modest due to their small, economically optimized capacity. Larger centralized storage is shown to reduce transformer peak power, but risks increasing line loading, suggesting a need for careful sizing and placement.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Imitation Learning: Layered Control Architecture for Certifiable Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables autonomous behavior by learning from expert demonstrations. While more sample-efficient than comparative alternatives like reinforcement learning, IL is sensitive to compounding errors induced by distribution shifts. There are two significant sources of distribution shifts when using IL-based feedback laws on systems: distribution shifts caused by policy error and distribution shifts due to exogenous disturbances and endogenous model errors due to lack of learning. Our previously developed approaches, Taylor Series Imitation Learning (TaSIL) and $\mathcal{L}_1$ -Distributionally Robust Adaptive Control (\ellonedrac), address the challenge of distribution shifts in complementary ways. While TaSIL offers robustness against policy error-induced distribution shifts, \ellonedrac offers robustness against distribution shifts due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. To enable certifiable IL for learned and/or uncertain dynamical systems, we formulate \textit{Distributionally Robust Imitation Policy (DRIP)} architecture, a Layered Control Architecture (LCA) that integrates TaSIL and~\ellonedrac. By judiciously designing individual layer-centric input and output requirements, we show how we can guarantee certificates for the entire control pipeline. Our solution paves the path for designing fully certifiable autonomy pipelines, by integrating learning-based components, such as perception, with certifiable model-based decision-making through the proposed LCA approach.</description>

      <title>Security Risks of Agentic Vehicles: A Systematic Analysis of Cognitive and Cross-Layer Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI is increasingly being explored and introduced in both manually driven and autonomous vehicles, leading to the notion of Agentic Vehicles (AgVs), with capabilities such as memory-based personalization, goal interpretation, strategic reasoning, and tool-mediated assistance. While frameworks such as the OWASP Agentic AI Security Risks highlight vulnerabilities in reasoning-driven AI systems, they are not designed for safety-critical cyber-physical platforms such as vehicles, nor do they account for interactions with other layers such as perception, communication, and control layers. This paper investigates security threats in AgVs, including OWASP-style risks and cyber-attacks from other layers affecting the agentic layer. By introducing a role-based architecture for agentic vehicles, consisting of a Personal Agent and a Driving Strategy Agent, we will investigate vulnerabilities in both agentic AI layer and cross-layer risks, including risks originating from upstream layers (e.g., perception layer, control layer, etc.). A severity matrix and attack-chain analysis illustrate how small distortions can escalate into misaligned or unsafe behavior in both human-driven and autonomous vehicles. The resulting framework provides the first structured foundation for analyzing security risks of agentic AI in both current and emerging vehicle platforms.</description>

      <title>NeuRehab: A Reinforcement Learning and Spiking Neural Network-Based Rehab Automation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in robotic rehabilitation therapy have provided modular exercise systems for post-stroke muscle recovery with basic control schemes. But these systems struggle to adapt to patients' complex and ever-changing behaviour, and to operate within mobile settings, such as heat and power. To aid this, we present NeuRehab: an end-to-end framework consisting of a training and inference pipeline with AI-based automation, co-designed with neuromorphic computing-based control systems that balance action performance, power consumption, and observed latency. The framework consists of 2 partitions. One is designated for the rehabilitation device based on ultra-low power spiking networks deployed on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. The other resides on stationary hardware that can accommodate computationally intensive hardware for fine-tuning on a per-patient basis. By maintaining a communication channel between both the modules and splitting the algorithm components, the power and latency requirements of the movable system have been optimised, while retaining the learning performance advantages of compute- and power-hungry hardware on the stationary machine. As part of the framework, we propose (a) the split machine learning processes for efficiency in architectural utilisation, and (b) task-specific temporal optimisations to lower edge-inference control latency. This paper evaluates the proposed methods on a reference stepper motor-based shoulder exercise. Overall, these methods offer comparable performance uplifts over the State-of-the-art for neuromorphic deployment, while achieving over 60% savings in both power and latency during inference compared to standard implementations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear moving horizon estimation for robust state and parameter estimation -- extended version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a moving horizon estimation scheme to estimate the states and the unknown constant parameters of general nonlinear uncertain discrete-time systems. The proposed framework and analysis explicitly do not involve the a priori verification of a particular excitation condition for the parameters. Instead, we use online information about the actual excitation of the parameters at any time during operation and ensure that the regularization term in the cost function is always automatically selected appropriately. This ensures that the state and parameter estimation error is bounded for all times, even if the parameters are never (or only rarely) excited during operation. Robust exponential stability of the state and parameter estimation error emerges under an additional uniform condition on the maximum duration of insufficient excitation. The theoretical results are illustrated by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Dunkelflaute -- An analysis of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, also called "Dunkelflaute", emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order asymptotic observer of nonlinear friction for precise motion control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear friction has long been, and continues to be, one of the major challenges for precision motion control systems. A linear asymptotic observer of the motion state variables with nonlinear friction uses a dedicated state-space representation of the dynamic friction force (including pre-sliding) [25], which is robust to the noisy input signals. The observer implements the reduced-order Luenberger observation law, while assuming the output displacement is the only available measurement. The latter is relevant for multiple motion control applications with use of encoder-type sensors. The uniform asymptotic stability and convergence analysis of the proposed observer are elaborated in the present work by using the Lyapunov function-based stability criterion by Ignatyev and imposing parametric constraints on the time-dependent eigenvalues of the system matrix to be always negative real. A design procedure for assigning a dominant, and thus slowest, real pole of the observer is proposed. Explanative numerical examples accompany the developed analysis. In addition, a thorough experimental evaluation is given for the proposed observer-based friction compensation which is performed for positioning and tracking tasks. The observer-based compensation, which can serve as a plug-in to a standard feedback controller, extends a PID feedback control that is optimally tuned for disturbance suppression. The experimental results are compared with and without the plugged-in observer-based compensator.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Control Barrier Functions: Nested Boolean and p-choose-r Compositions of Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of composing multiple control barrier functions (CBFs) -- and matrix control barrier functions (MCBFs) -- through logical and combinatorial operations. Standard CBF formulations naturally enable conjunctive (AND) combinations, but disjunctive (OR) and more general logical structures introduce nonsmoothness and possibly a combinatorial blow-up in the number of logical combinations. We introduce the framework of combinatorial CBFs that addresses p-choose-r safety specifications and their nested composition. The proposed framework ensures safety for the exact safe set in a scalable way, using the original number of primitive constraints. We establish theoretical guarantees on safety under these compositions, and we demonstrate their use on a patrolling problem in a multi-agent system.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Voltage Control of AC Microgrids with Constant Power Loads using Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel nonlinear decentralized voltage controller for constrained regulation of meshed AC Microgrid networks with high penetration of time-varying constant power loads. Modelling the load demand as a constantly evolving unknown disturbance, the network model is reformulated in a cascaded structure composed of a nominal, \ie uncertainty-free, and an error subsystem. By adopting a suitable control barrier function, we formulate a continuous-time control law and derive analytic conditions on the tuning parameters, such that the distance between the true and the nominal state trajectories is bounded. Under sufficient conditions, we prove asymptotic stability of the cascaded dynamics with respect to an equilibrium set and also provide an estimate of the region of attraction. In addition, it is rigorously shown that the proposed nonlinear control law enforces constrained regulation around a rated voltage value, without the need of saturation devices. The operation of the closed-loop system is illustrated both via simulation and real-time HIL scenarios, demonstrating bounded operation and convergence to a neighbourhood of the desired reference vector.</description>

      <title>Data-driven uncertainty-aware seakeeping prediction of the Delft 372 catamaran using ensemble Hankel dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present and validate an ensemble-based Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (HDMDc) for uncertainty-aware seakeeping predictions of a high-speed catamaran, namely the Delft 372 model. Experimental measurements (time histories) of wave elevation at the longitudinal center of gravity, heave, pitch, notional flight-deck velocity, notional bridge acceleration, and total resistance were collected from irregular wave basin tests on a 1:33.3 scale replica of the Delft 372 model under sea state 5 conditions at Fr = 0.425, and organized into training, validation, and test sets. The HDMDc algorithm constructs an equation-free linear reduced-order model of the seakeeping vessel by augmenting states and inputs with their time-lagged copies to capture nonlinear and memory effects. Two ensembling strategies, namely Bayesian HDMDc (BHDMDc), which samples hyperparameters considered stochastic variables with prior distribution to produce posterior mean forecasts with confidence intervals, and Frequentist HDMDc (FHDMDc), which aggregates multiple model obtained over data subsets, are compared in providing seakeeping prediction and uncertainty quantification. The FHDMDc approach is found to improve the accuracy of the predictions compared to the deterministic counterpart, also providing robust uncertainty estimation; whereas the application of BHDMDc to the present test case is not found beneficial in comparison to the deterministic model. FHDMDc-derived probability density functions for the motions closely match both experimental data and URANS results, demonstrating reliable and computationally efficient seakeeping prediction for design and operational support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highly anticipated 'Battle of the Water Networks' is back with a new challenge for the water community. This competition will be hosted at the 4th International Joint Conference on Water Distribution Systems Analysis and Computing and Control in the Water Industry (WDSA/CCWI 2026), taking place in Paphos, Cyprus, from May 18-21, 2026. This competition embodies the core mission of Water-Futures and the theme for WDSA/CCWI 2026: "Designing the next generation of urban water (and wastewater) systems."
  The objective is to design and operate a water distribution system over a long-term horizon under deep uncertainty, with interventions applied in stages. For the first time, this challenge features a staged-design approach, unobservable and unknown uncertainties, and incorporates elements of policymaking and artificial intelligence. The solutions will be assessed using a transparent and inspectable open-source evaluation framework.</description>

      <title>Observer-based Differentially Private Consensus for Linear Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differentially private consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) based on output feedback protocols. To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of \epsilon-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an \epsilon*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hybrid Model Predictive Control using Warm-Started Generalized Benders Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid model predictive control with both continuous and discrete variables is widely applicable to robotic control tasks, especially those involving contacts with the environment. Due to combinatorial complexity, the solving speed of hybrid MPC can be insufficient for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC algorithm based on Generalized Benders Decomposition. The algorithm enumerates and stores cutting planes online inside a finite buffer and transfers them across MPC iterations to provide warm-starts for new problem instances, significantly enhancing solving speed. We theoretically analyze this warm-starting performance by modeling the deviation of mode sequences through temporal shifting and stretching, deriving bounds on the dual gap between transferred optimality cuts and the true optimal costs, and utilizing these bounds to quantify the level of suboptimality guaranteed in the first solve of the Benders Master Problem. Our algorithm is validated in simulation through controlling a cart-pole system with soft contact walls, a free-flying robot navigating around obstacles, and a humanoid robot standing on one leg while pushing against walls with its hands for balance. For our benchmark problems, the algorithm enumerates cuts on the order of only tens to hundreds while reaching speeds 2-3 times faster than the off-the-shelf solver Gurobi, oftentimes exceeding 1000 Hz. The code is available at https://github.com/XuanLin/Benders-MPC.</description>

      <title>A Review of Software for Designing and Operating Quantum Networks</title>

Abstract: Quantum network protocol development is crucial to realizing a production-grade network that can support distributed sensing, secure communication, and utility-scale quantum computation. However, the transition from laboratory demonstration to deployable networks requires software implementations of architectures and protocols tailored to the unique constraints of quantum systems. This paper reviews the current state of software implementations for quantum networks, organized around the three-plane abstraction of infrastructure, logical, and control/service planes. We cover software for both designing quantum network protocols (e.g., SeQUeNCe, QuISP, and NetSquid) and operating them, with a focus on essential control/service plane functions such as entanglement, topology, and resource management, in a proposed taxonomy. Our review highlights a persistent gap between theoretical protocol proposals and their realization in simulators or testbeds, particularly in dynamic topology and network management. We conclude by outlining open challenges and proposing a roadmap for developing scalable software architectures to enable hybrid, large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work, represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while giving pointers towards potential future applications.</description>
