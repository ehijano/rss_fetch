      <title>Performance Comparison of 5G NR Uplink MIMO and Uplink Carrier Aggregations on Commercial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demands for uplink on mobile networks are increasing with the rapid development of social media platforms, 4K/8K content creation, IoT applications, and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) broadband. As a result, Uplink MIMO (UL-MIMO) and Uplink Carrier Aggregation (UL-CA) have been widely deployed for the first time on commercial 5G networks. UL-MIMO enables the transmission of two data streams on one frequency band in strong RF conditions, theoretically doubling throughput and efficiency. On the other hand, UL-CA allows for simultaneous upload on greater channel widths, allowing more resources to be assigned to a single UE for higher throughput. In the United States, T-Mobile USA, a mobile network operator (MNO), has deployed network-wide 5G Standalone (SA), along with UL-MIMO on Time Division Duplex (TDD) band n41 and UL-CA between TDD and Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) NR bands. In this paper, the uplink throughput performance of UL-MIMO and UL-CA will be evaluated on the commercial T-Mobile 5G network on a variety of RF environments and modes of transportation. It was found that, even with the efficiency gains, UL-MIMO yields slower uplink throughput in most scenarios. However, in stronger RF conditions, UL-MIMO can provide an adequate user experience, so capacity can be conserved by reserving UL-CA for UE in weaker RF conditions.</description>

      <title>A streaming algorithm and hardware accelerator for top-K flow detection in network traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the largest K flows in network traffic is an important task for applications such as flow scheduling and anomaly detection, which aim to improve network efficiency and security. However, accurately estimating flow frequencies is challenging due to the large number of flows and increasing network speeds. Hardware accelerators are often used in this endeavor due to their high computational power, but their limited amount of on-chip memory constrains their performance. Various sketch-based algorithms have been proposed to estimate properties of traffic such as frequency, with lower memory usage and theoretical bounds, but they often under perform with the skewed distribution of network traffic. In this work, we propose an algorithm for top-K identification using a modified TowerSketch and a priority queue array. Tested on real traffic traces, we identify the top-K flows, with K up to 32,768, with a precision of more than 0.94, and estimate their frequency with an average relative error under 1.96%. We designed and implemented an accelerator for this algorithm on an AMD VirtexU280 UltraScale+ FPGA, which processes one packet per cycle at392 MHz, reaching a minimum line rate of more than 200 Gbps.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Receiver-Side Scheduling for Smooth Interactive Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive applications such as cloud gaming, XR streaming, and real-time inference depend on data objects arriving at a steady cadence. In practice, network delay variation and recovery dynamics at the receiver distort this cadence even when transports deliver all packets correctly, which produces visible jitter, stalls, and unstable playback.
  We present a lightweight receiver-side scheduling approach that regularizes release timing after recovery. The scheduler maintains an adaptive estimate of effective path delay and adjusts release times asymmetrically, responding quickly to late arrivals and only gradually to early ones. This upper-envelope behavior keeps release aligned with recent delay peaks and maintains smooth playback with minimal added latency. The scheduler runs entirely on the receiver clock and requires no feedback or synchronization.
  As a concrete example, we integrate receiver-side scheduling into the BitRipple Tunnel (BRT) overlay, an application-layer software system that forwards traffic without altering the underlying transport protocol. Within BRT, the scheduler functions as an independent module that regulates delivery timing for forwarded objects.
  Evaluating BRT with receiver-side scheduling on a cloud-gaming workload shows that the scheduler removes virtually all large jitter excursions and yields tightly clustered release intervals that improve visible smoothness. Broader latency improvements arise from the behavior of the full BRT overlay. Receiver-side scheduling can also be integrated modularly into transport stacks such as TCP, QUIC, WebRTC, UDP, or RTP, which are natural deployment points for future work.</description>

      <title>One Walk is All You Need: Data-Efficient 3D RF Scene Reconstruction with Human Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing 3D Radiance Field (RF) scenes through opaque obstacles is a long-standing goal, yet it is fundamentally constrained by a laborious data acquisition process requiring thousands of static measurements, which treats human motion as noise to be filtered. This work introduces a new paradigm with a core objective: to perform fast, data-efficient, and high-fidelity RF reconstruction of occluded 3D static scenes, using only a single, brief human walk. We argue that this unstructured motion is not noise, but is in fact an information-rich signal available for reconstruction. To achieve this, we design a factorization framework based on composite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that learns to model the dynamic effects of human motion from the persistent static scene geometry within a raw RF stream. Trained on just a single 60-second casual walk, our model reconstructs the full static scene with a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.96, remarkably outperforming heavily-sampled state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 12%. By transforming the human movements into its valuable signals, our method eliminates the data acquisition bottleneck and paves the way for on-the-fly 3D RF mapping of unseen environments.</description>

      <title>An Introductory Study on the Power Consumption Overhead of ERC-4337 Bundlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethereum is currently the main blockchain ecosystem providing decentralised trust guarantees for applications ranging from finance to e-government. A common criticism of blockchain networks has been their energy consumption and operational costs. The switch from Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol has significantly reduced this issue, though concerns remain, especially with network expansions via additional layers. The ERC-4337 standard is a recent proposal that facilitates end-user access to Ethereum-backed applications. It introduces a middleware called a bundler, operated as a third-party service, where part of its operational cost is represented by its power consumption. While bundlers have served over 500 million requests in the past two years, fewer than 15 official bundler providers exist, compared to over 100 regular Ethereum access providers. In this paper, we provide a first look at the active power consumption overhead that a bundler would add to an Ethereum access service. Using SmartWatts, a monitoring system leveraging Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) hardware interfaces, we empirically determine correlations between the bundler workload and its active power consumption.</description>

      <title>UplinkNet: Practical Commercial 5G Standalone (SA) Uplink Throughput Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While 5G New Radio (NR) networks offer significant uplink throughput improvements, these gains are primarily realized when User Equipment (UE) connects to high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. The growing demand for uplink-intensive applications, such as real-time UHD 4K/8K video streaming and Virtual Reality (VR)/Augmented Reality (AR) content, highlights the need for accurate uplink throughput prediction to optimize user Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we introduce UplinkNet, a compact neural network designed to predict future uplink throughput using past throughput and RF parameters available through the Android API. With a model size limited to approximately 4,000 parameters, UplinkNet is suitable for IoT and low-power devices. The network was trained on real-world drive test data from commercial 5G Standalone (SA) networks in Tokyo, Japan, and Bangkok, Thailand, across various mobility conditions. To ensure practical implementation, the model uses only Android API data and was evaluated on unseen data against other models. Results show that UplinkNet achieves an average prediction accuracy of 98.9% and an RMSE of 5.22 Mbps, outperforming all other models while maintaining a compact size and low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of 5G FR2 (mmWave) Downlink 256QAM on Commercial 5G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 5G New Radio (NR) standard introduces new frequency bands allocated in Frequency Range 2 (FR2) to support enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) in congested environments and enables new use cases such as Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC). The 3GPP introduced 256QAM support for FR2 frequency bands to further enhance downlink capacity. However, sustaining 256QAM on FR2 in practical environments is challenging due to strong path loss and susceptibility to distortion. While 256QAM can improve theoretical throughput by 33%, compared to 64QAM, and is widely adopted in FR1, its real-world impact when utilized in FR2 is questionable, given the significant path loss and distortions experienced in the FR2 range. Additionally, using higher modulation correlates to higher BLER, increased instability, and retransmission. Moreover, 256QAM also utilizes a different MCS table defining the modulation and code rate at different Channel Quality Indexes (CQI), affecting the UE's link adaptation behavior. This paper investigates the real-world performance of 256QAM utilization on FR2 bands in two countries, across three RAN manufacturers, and in both NSA (EN-DC) and SA (NR-DC) configurations, under various scenarios, including open-air plazas, city centers, footbridges, train station platforms, and stationary environments. The results show that 256QAM provides a reasonable throughput gain when stationary but marginal improvements when there is UE mobility while increasing the probability of NACK responses, increasing BLER, and the number of retransmissions. Finally, MATLAB simulations are run to validate the findings as well as explore the effect of the recently introduced 1024QAM on FR2.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Radio-Frequency Radiance Fields for Spatial Spectrum Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present GRaF, Generalizable Radio-Frequency (RF) Radiance Fields, a framework that models RF signal propagation to synthesize spatial spectra at arbitrary transmitter or receiver locations, where each spectrum measures signal power across all surrounding directions at the receiver. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that adapt vanilla Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to the RF domain with scene-specific training, GRaF generalizes across scenes to synthesize spectra. To enable this, we prove an interpolation theory in the RF domain: the spatial spectrum from a transmitter can be approximated using spectra from geographically proximate transmitters. Building on this theory, GRaF comprises two components: (i) a geometry-aware Transformer encoder that captures spatial correlations from neighboring transmitters to learn a scene-independent latent RF radiance field, and (ii) a neural ray tracing algorithm that estimates spectrum reception at the receiver. Experimental results demonstrate that GRaF outperforms existing methods on single-scene benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen scene layouts.</description>

      <title>Wideband RF Radiance Field Modeling Using Frequency-embedded 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indoor environments typically contain diverse RF signals distributed across multiple frequency bands, including NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, and millimeter-wave. Consequently, wideband RF modeling is essential for practical applications such as joint deployment of heterogeneous RF systems, cross-band communication, and distributed RF sensing. Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques effectively reconstruct RF radiance fields at a single frequency, they cannot model fields at arbitrary or unknown frequencies across a wide range. In this paper, we present a novel 3DGS algorithm for unified wideband RF radiance field modeling. RF wave propagation depends on signal frequency and the 3D spatial environment, including geometry and material electromagnetic (EM) properties. To address these factors, we introduce a frequency-embedded EM feature network that utilizes 3D Gaussian spheres at each spatial location to learn the relationship between frequency and transmission characteristics, such as attenuation and radiance intensity. With a dataset containing sparse frequency samples in a specific 3D environment, our model can efficiently reconstruct RF radiance fields at arbitrary and unseen frequencies. To assess our approach, we introduce a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset with 50,000 samples spanning 1 to 94 GHz across six indoor environments. Experimental results show that the proposed model trained on multiple frequencies achieves a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.922 for PAS reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art single-frequency 3DGS models with SSIM of 0.863.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning-Based Telematic Routing Protocol for the Internet of Underwater Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) has a lot of problems, like low bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and not enough energy. Routing protocols that were made for land-based networks, like RPL, don't work well in these underwater settings. This paper talks about RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to make things work better in underwater situations. Each node has a small RL agent that picks the best parent node depending on local data such the link quality, buffer level, packet delivery ratio, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA works with all standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to help people make decisions in real time. Aqua-Sim simulations demonstrate that RL-RPL-UA boosts packet delivery by up to 9.2%, uses 14.8% less energy per packet, and adds 80 seconds to the network's lifetime compared to previous approaches. These results show that RL-RPL-UA is a potential and energy-efficient way to route data in underwater networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting exploits hardware imperfections for device identification, but distinguishing between same-model devices remains challenging due to their minimal hardware variations. Existing datasets for RF fingerprinting are constrained by small device scales and heterogeneous models, which hinder robust training and fair evaluation of machine learning methods. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset of same-model devices along with an open-source experimental framework. The dataset is built using 123 same-model commercial IEEE 802.11g devices, which contain 35.42 million raw I/Q samples from the preambles and corresponding 1.85 million RF features. The accompanying framework further provides a fully reproducible pipeline from data collection to performance evaluation. Within this framework, a Random Forest-based algorithm is implemented as a baseline to achieve 89.06% identification accuracy on this dataset.</description>

      <title>SoK: Security Evaluation of Wi-Fi CSI Biometrics: Attacks, Metrics, and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has been repeatedly proposed as a biometric modality, often with reports of high accuracy and operational feasibility. However, the field lacks a consolidated understanding of its security properties, adversarial resilience, and methodological consistency. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines CSI-based biometric authentication through a security lens, analyzing how existing works diverge in sensing infrastructure, signal representations, feature pipelines, learning models, and evaluation methodologies. Our synthesis reveals systemic inconsistencies: reliance on aggregate accuracy metrics, limited reporting of FAR/FRR/EER, absence of per-user risk analysis, and scarce consideration of threat models or adversarial feasibility.
  To this end, we construct a unified evaluation framework to expose these issues empirically and demonstrate how security-relevant metrics such as per-class EER, Frequency Count of Scores (FCS), and the Gini Coefficient uncover risk concentration that remains hidden under traditional reporting practices. The resulting analysis highlights concrete attack surfaces--including replay, geometric mimicry, and environmental perturbation--and shows how methodological choices materially influence vulnerability profiles. Based on these findings, we articulate the security boundaries of current CSI biometrics and provide guidelines for rigorous evaluation, reproducible experimentation, and future research directions. This SoK offers the security community a structured, evidence-driven reassessment of Wi-Fi CSI biometrics and their suitability as an authentication primitive.</description>
