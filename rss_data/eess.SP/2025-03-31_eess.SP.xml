      <title>Low-Complexity Near-Field Beam Training with DFT Codebook based on Beam Pattern Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) operating in high-frequency bands have spurred the development of near-field communication, driving advancements in beam training and signal processing design. This paper proposed an efficient near-field beam training method using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook that is conventionally used for far-field users (FUs). We begin by analyzing the received beam pattern and deriving a closed-form expression for its width and central beam gain, which are validated through simulations. Using these derivations, we define a modified Rayleigh distance to distinguish between near-field and far-field users. Building on this, we propose a beam training method capable of simultaneously estimating user angle and distance with a complexity of O(1). Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach, demonstrating its capability for low-complexity near-field beam training while achieving high estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Signal: Medication State Effect on EEG-Based AI models for Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses a growing challenge due to its increasing prevalence, complex pathology, and functional ramifications. Electroencephalography (EEG), when integrated with artificial intelligence (AI), holds promise for monitoring disease progression, identifying sub-phenotypes, and personalizing treatment strategies. However, the effect of medication state on AI model learning and generalization remains poorly understood, potentially limiting EEG-based AI models clinical applicability. This study evaluates how medication state influences the training and generalization of EEG-based AI models. Paired EEG recordings were utilized from individuals with PD in both ON- and OFF-medication states. AI models were trained on recordings from each state separately and evaluated on independent test sets representing both ON- and OFF-medication conditions. Model performance was assessed using multiple metrics, with accuracy (ACC) as the primary outcome. Statistical significance was assessed via permutation testing (p-values&lt;0.05). Our results reveal that models trained on OFF-medication data exhibited consistent but suboptimal performance across both medication states (ACC_OFF-ON=55.3\pm8.8 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\pm8.7). In contrast, models trained on ON-medication data demonstrated significantly higher performance on ON-medication recordings (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\pm7.1) but significantly reduced generalization to OFF-medication data (ACC_ON-OFF=76.0\pm7.2). Notably, models trained on ON-medication data consistently outperformed those trained on OFF-medication data within their respective states (ACC_ON-ON=80.7\pm7.1 and ACC_OFF-OFF=56.2\pm8.7). Our findings suggest that medication state significantly influences the patterns learned by AI models. Addressing this challenge is essential to enhance the robustness and clinical utility of AI models for PD characterization and management.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Learning of a Foundation Model for Analog Layout Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a UNet-based foundation model and its self-supervised learning method to address two key challenges: 1) lack of qualified annotated analog layout data, and 2) excessive variety in analog layout design tasks. For self-supervised learning, we propose random patch sampling and random masking techniques automatically to obtain enough training data from a small unannotated layout dataset. The obtained data are greatly augmented, less biased, equally sized, and contain enough information for excessive varieties of qualified layout patterns. By pre-training with the obtained data, the proposed foundation model can learn implicit general knowledge on layout patterns so that it can be fine-tuned for various downstream layout tasks with small task-specific datasets. Fine-tuning provides an efficient and consolidated methodology for diverse downstream tasks, reducing the enormous human effort to develop a model per task separately. In experiments, the foundation model was pre-trained using 324,000 samples obtained from 6 silicon-proved manually designed analog circuits, then it was fine-tuned for the five example downstream tasks: generating contacts, vias, dummy fingers, N-wells, and metal routings. The fine-tuned models successfully performed these tasks for more than one thousand unseen layout inputs, generating DRC/LVS-clean layouts for 96.6% of samples. Compared with training the model from scratch for the metal routing task, fine-tuning required only 1/8 of the data to achieve the same dice score of 0.95. With the same data, fine-tuning achieved a 90% lower validation loss and a 40% higher benchmark score than training from scratch.</description>

      <title>mmHRR: Monitoring Heart Rate Recovery with Millimeter Wave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate recovery (HRR) within the initial minute following exercise is a widely utilized metric for assessing cardiac autonomic function in individuals and predicting mortality risk in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, prevailing solutions for HRR monitoring typically involve the use of specialized medical equipment or contact wearable sensors, resulting in high costs and poor user experience. In this paper, we propose a contactless HRR monitoring technique, mmHRR, which achieves accurate heart rate (HR) estimation with a commercial mmWave radar. Unlike HR estimation at rest, the HR varies quickly after exercise and the heartbeat signal entangles with the respiration harmonics. To overcome these hurdles and effectively estimate the HR from the weak and non-stationary heartbeat signal, we propose a novel signal processing pipeline, including dynamic target tracking, adaptive heartbeat signal extraction, and accurate HR estimation with composite sliding windows. Real-world experiments demonstrate that mmHRR exhibits exceptional robustness across diverse environmental conditions, and achieves an average HR estimation error of 3.31 bpm (beats per minute), 71% lower than that of the state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Acquisition in Multistatic MIMO-OFDM Joint Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a multistatic MIMO-OFDM joint sensing and communication (JSC) system that leverages cooperation among spatially distributed base stations (BSs) to detect and localize multiple targets through soft fusion of range-angle maps. We propose an innovative selective data fusion strategy that combines only the most reliable regions of range-angle maps from each bistatic pair, mitigating the adverse effects of residual clutter and target smearing inherent to bistatic configurations. To further enhance multi-view perception, we introduce a round-robin transmitter role strategy, enabling BSs to cooperate and exploit target spatial diversity. Finally, we assess the system performance in a cluttered environment using the generalized optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) and root mean squared error (RMSE) metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approaches in improving detection and localization.</description>

      <title>Fighting Fire with Fire: Channel-Independent RF Fingerprinting via the Ratio of Linear to Logarithmic Differential Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eliminating the influence of temporally varying channel components on the radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) extraction has been an enduring and challenging issue. To overcome this problem, we propose a channel-independent RFF extraction method inspired by the idea of 'fighting fire with fire'. Specifically, we derive the linear differential spectrum and the logarithmic differential spectrum of the channel frequency responses (CFRs) from the received signals at different times, and then calculate the ratio of the two spectrums. It is found that the division operation effectively counteracts the channel effects, while simultaneously preserving the integrity of the RFFs. Our experiments on LTE-V2X, LoRa and Wi-Fi devices show that the proposed method achieves an average identification accuracy exceeding 95% across various environments.</description>

      <title>Optimized Vehicular Antenna Placement for Phase-Coherent Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed multi-antenna systems are an important enabling technology for future intelligent transportation systems (ITS), showing promising performance in vehicular communications and near-field (NF) localization applications. This work investigates optimal deployments of phase-coherent sub-arrays on a vehicle for NF localization in terms of a Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-based metric. Sub-array placements consider practical geometrical constraints on a three-dimensional vehicle model accounting for self-occlusions. Results show that, for coherent NF localization of the vehicle, the aperture spanned by the sub-arrays should be maximized and a larger number of sub-arrays results in more even coverage over the vehicle orientations under a fixed total number of antenna elements, contrasting with the outcomes of incoherent localization. Moreover, while coherent NF processing significantly enhances accuracy, it also leads to more intricate cost functions, necessitating computationally more complex algorithms than incoherent processing.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Volcanic Radiative Power (VPR) at Fuego Volcano Using Bayesian Regularized Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting volcanic activity is critical for hazard assessment and risk mitigation. Volcanic Radiative Power (VPR), derived from thermal remote sensing data, serves as an essential indicator of volcanic activity. In this study, we employ Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks (BRNN) to predict future VPR values based on historical data from Fuego Volcano, comparing its performance against Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) models. The results indicate that BRNN outperforms SCG and LM, achieving the lowest mean squared error (1.77E+16) and the highest R-squared value (0.50), demonstrating its superior ability to capture VPR variability while minimizing overfitting. Despite these promising results, challenges remain in improving the model's predictive accuracy. Future research should focus on integrating additional geophysical parameters, such as seismic and gas emission data, to enhance forecasting precision. The findings highlight the potential of machine learning models, particularly BRNN, in advancing volcanic activity forecasting, contributing to more effective early warning systems for volcanic hazards.</description>

      <title>LightSNN: Lightweight Architecture Search for Sparse and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are highly regarded for their energy efficiency, inherent activation sparsity, and suitability for real-time processing in edge devices. However, most current SNN methods adopt architectures resembling traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), leading to suboptimal performance when applied to SNNs. While SNNs excel in energy efficiency, they have been associated with lower accuracy levels than traditional ANNs when utilizing conventional architectures. In response, in this work we present LightSNN, a rapid and efficient Neural Network Architecture Search (NAS) technique specifically tailored for SNNs that autonomously leverages the most suitable architecture, striking a good balance between accuracy and efficiency by enforcing sparsity. Based on the spiking NAS network (SNASNet) framework, a cell-based search space including backward connections is utilized to build our training-free pruning-based NAS mechanism. Our technique assesses diverse spike activation patterns across different data samples using a sparsity-aware Hamming distance fitness evaluation. Thorough experiments are conducted on both static (CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) and neuromorphic datasets (DVS128-Gesture). Our LightSNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, improves performance on DVS128Gesture by 4.49%, and significantly reduces search time, most notably offering a 98x speedup over SNASNet and running 30% faster than the best existing method on DVS128Gesture.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mobile Crowdsensing Efficiency: A Coverage-aware Resource Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the resource management challenges in next-generation mobile crowdsensing networks with the goal of minimizing task completion latency while ensuring coverage performance, i.e., an essential metric to ensure comprehensive data collection across the monitored area, yet it has been commonly overlooked in existing studies. To this end, we formulate a weighted latency and coverage gap minimization problem via jointly optimizing user selection, subchannel allocation, and sensing task allocation. The formulated minimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer programming issue. To facilitate the analysis, we decompose the original optimization problem into two subproblems. One focuses on optimizing sensing task and subband allocation under fixed sensing user selection, which is optimally solved by the Hungarian algorithm via problem reformulation. Building upon these findings, we introduce a time-efficient two-sided swapping method to refine the scheduled user set and enhance system performance. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared to various benchmark strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Subjectivity: Continuous Cybersickness Detection Using EEG-based Multitaper Spectrum Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) presents immersive opportunities across many applications, yet the inherent risk of developing cybersickness during interaction can severely reduce enjoyment and platform adoption. Cybersickness is marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work primarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and motion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the \emph{dynamic nature} of cybersickness while users experience and freely interact in VR. We propose a novel method to \emph{continuously} identify and quantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users' \emph{passively monitored} electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method estimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing techniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels in real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific calibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses the considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness research.</description>

      <title>Low Rank and Sparse Fourier Structure in Recurrent Networks Trained on Modular Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modular addition tasks serve as a useful test bed for observing empirical phenomena in deep learning, including the phenomenon of \emph{grokking}. Prior work has shown that one-layer transformer architectures learn Fourier Multiplication circuits to solve modular addition tasks. In this paper, we show that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) trained on modular addition tasks also use a Fourier Multiplication strategy. We identify low rank structures in the model weights, and attribute model components to specific Fourier frequencies, resulting in a sparse representation in the Fourier space. We also show empirically that the RNN is robust to removing individual frequencies, while the performance degrades drastically as more frequencies are ablated from the model.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Turbo Message Passing for Plug-and-Play Compressive Image Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Message passing algorithms have been tailored for compressive imaging applications by plugging in different types of off-the-shelf image denoisers. These off-the-shelf denoisers mostly rely on some generic or hand-crafted priors for denoising. Due to their insufficient accuracy in capturing the true image prior, these methods often fail to produce satisfactory results, especially in largely underdetermined scenarios. On the other hand, score-based generative modeling offers a promising way to accurately characterize the sophisticated image distribution. In this paper, by exploiting the close relation between score-based modeling and empirical Bayes-optimal denoising, we devise a message passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. This framework is firmly rooted in Bayesian formalism, in which state evolution (SE) equations accurately predict its asymptotic performance. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that our method strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff than conventional message passing, regularized linear regression, and score-based posterior sampling baselines. Remarkably, our method typically requires less than 20 neural function evaluations (NFEs) to converge.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enhanced Downlink Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the potential of exploiting movable antennas (MAs) to enhance the performance of a multi-user downlink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the transmit beampattern gain for sensing while simultaneously meeting each user's communication requirement by jointly optimizing antenna positions and beamforming design. The problem formulated is highly non-convex and involves multivariate-coupled constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce a series of auxiliary random variables and transform the original problem into an augmented Lagrangian problem. A double-loop algorithm based on a penalty dual decomposition framework is then developed to solve the problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed design, demonstrating its superiority over MA designs based on successive convex approximation optimization and other baseline approaches in ISAC systems. The results also highlight the advantages of MAs in achieving better sensing performance and improved beam control, especially for sparse arrays with large apertures.</description>

      <title>Diversity and Multiplexing for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13948</link>

Abstract: A general fading model for multipath channels between two non-parallel continuous-aperture arrays (CAPAs) is proposed. Building on this model, the performance of diversity and multiplexing achieved by CAPAs over fading channels is analyzed. i) For multiple-input single-output (MISO) and single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channels, Landau's eigenvalue theorem is applied to analyze the autocorrelation of the spatial response. Closed-form expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP) and ergodic channel capacity (ECC). Asymptotic analyses in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime are conducted to reveal the maximal achievable diversity and multiplexing gains. The diversity-multiplexing trade-off (DMT) is characterized, along with the array gain within the DMT framework. ii) For multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, a wavenumber-domain-based transmission framework is proposed to leverage the spatial degrees of freedom offered by CAPAs. Asymptotic approximations for the OP and ECC are derived, and the DMT is explored. The performance of CAPAs is further compared with that of conventional spatially-discrete arrays (SPDAs). Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that: i) CAPAs achieve a lower OP and higher ECC than SPDAs; ii) CAPAs achieve the same DMT as SPDAs with antenna spacing no larger than half a wavelength while attaining a higher array gain; and iii) CAPAs outperform SPDAs with antenna spacing greater than half a wavelength in terms of DMT.</description>

      <title>RF Challenge: The Data-Driven Radio Frequency Signal Separation Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a data-driven approach that leverages deep-learning methods. A primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of the RF Challenge, which is a publicly available, diverse RF signal dataset for data-driven analyses of RF signal problems. Specifically, we adopt a simplified signal model for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. For this signal model, we introduce a set of carefully chosen deep learning architectures, incorporating key domain-informed modifications alongside traditional benchmark solutions to establish baseline performance metrics for this intricate, ubiquitous problem. Through extensive simulations involving eight different signal mixture types, we demonstrate the superior performance (in some cases, by two orders of magnitude) of architectures such as UNet and WaveNet over traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation. Our findings suggest that the data-driven approach can yield scalable solutions, in the sense that the same architectures may be similarly trained and deployed for different types of signals. Moreover, these findings further corroborate the promising potential of deep learning algorithms for enhancing communication systems, particularly via interference mitigation. This work also includes results from an open competition based on the RF Challenge, hosted at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP'24).</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling-Aware Channel Estimation and Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the problems of channel estimation and beamforming for active reconfigurable intelligent surface~(RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, incorporating the mutual coupling~(MC) effect through an electromagnetically consistent model based on scattering parameters. We first demonstrate that MC can be incorporated into a compressed sensing~(CS) estimation formulation, albeit with an increase in the dimensionality of the sensing matrix. To overcome this increased complexity, we propose a two-stage strategy. Initially, a low-complexity MC-unaware CS estimation is performed to obtain a coarse channel estimate, which is then used to implement a dictionary reduction (DR), effectively reducing the dimensionality of the sensing matrices. This method achieves low complexity comparable to the conventional MC-unaware approach while providing estimation accuracy close to that of the high-complexity MC-aware CS method. Furthermore, we consider the joint optimization of RIS configuration, base station precoding, and user combining in an single-user MIMO system. We employ an alternating optimization strategy to optimize these three beamformers. The primary challenge lies in optimizing the RIS configuration, as the MC effect renders the problem non-convex and intractable. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the Neumann series expansion. Within the SCA framework, we propose a surrogate function that rigorously satisfies both convexity and equal-gradient conditions to update the iteration direction. Numerical results validate our proposal, demonstrating that the proposed channel estimation and beamforming methods effectively manage the MC in RIS, achieving higher spectral efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Graph Sampling for Scalable and Expressive Graph Neural Networks on Homophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in many graph machine learning tasks but face challenges when scaling to large networks. GNN transferability allows training on smaller graphs and applying the model to larger ones, but existing methods often rely on random subsampling, leading to disconnected subgraphs and reduced model expressivity. We propose a novel graph sampling algorithm that leverages feature homophily to preserve graph structure. By minimizing the trace of the data correlation matrix, our method better preserves the graph Laplacian trace -- a proxy for the graph connectivity -- than random sampling, while achieving lower complexity than spectral methods. Experiments on citation networks show improved performance in preserving Laplacian trace and GNN transferability compared to random sampling.</description>

      <title>Upper Mid-Band Channel Measurements and Characterization at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 in an Indoor Factory Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03565v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents detailed radio propagation measurements for an indoor factory (InF) environment at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using a 1 GHz bandwidth channel sounder. Conducted at the NYU MakerSpace in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn, NY, USA, our measurement campaign characterizes the radio propagation in a representative small factory with diverse machinery and open workspaces across 12 locations, comprising 5 line-of-sight (LOS) and 7 non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Analysis using the close-in (CI) free space path loss (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance reveals path loss exponents (PLE) below 2 in LOS at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, while in NLOS, PLE is similar to free-space propagation (e.g., PLE = 2). The RMS delay spread (DS) decreases at higher frequencies with a clear frequency dependence. Also, measurements show a wider RMS angular spread (AS) in NLOS compared to LOS at both frequency bands, with a decreasing trend as frequency increases. These observations in a dense-scatterer factory environment demonstrate frequency-dependent behavior that differs from existing industry-standard 3GPP models. Our findings provide crucial insights into complex propagation mechanisms in factory environments, essential for designing robust air interface and industrial wireless networks at the upper mid-band FR3 spectrum.</description>

      <title>Fast Fractional Programming for Multi-Cell Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the coordinate multi-cell beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In particular, we assume that each base station (BS) has massive antennas. The optimization objective is to maximize a weighted sum of the data rates (for communications) and the Fisher information (for sensing). We first show that the conventional beamforming method for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, i.e., the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, works for the ISAC problem case from a fractional programming (FP) perspective. However, the WMMSE algorithm frequently requires computing the $N\times N$ matrix inverse, where $N$ is the number of transmit or receive antennas, so the algorithm becomes quite costly when antennas are massively deployed. To address this issue, we develop a nonhomogeneous bound and use it in conjunction with the FP technique to solve the ISAC beamforming problem without the need to invert any large matrices. It is further shown that the resulting new FP algorithm has an intimate connection with gradient projection, based on which we can accelerate the convergence via Nesterov's gradient extrapolation.</description>
