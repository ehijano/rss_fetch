      <title>Thermal and microclimatic behavior of OASIS schoolyard paving materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of its Resilience Strategy, the City of Paris' OASIS program aims to contribute ot its adaptation to heatwaves and climate change by transforming schoolyards into climate shelters, namely via desealing and greening. In this context, a variety of alternative pavement materials have been proposed to replace the initial schoolyard pavement, composed of an asphalt sidewalk structure. In the context of the EU-funded ERDF UIA OASIS project, the thermal performance of these alternative materials and their impact in terms of urban cooling was explored. To this aim, five samples of reference and innovative schoolyard pavements were studied in the lab under heat-wave conditions. Alternative green, biosourced, recycled and reflective pavement solutions were compared to standard fine-aggregate asphalt concrete. Their performance was evaluated with regards to their contribution to the urban heat island phenomenon and to pedestrian heat stress, account for the typical use schedule of schoolyards. Green and biosourced materials were found to perform well for both indicators, while the standard and recycled solutions had poor UHI performance but had limited negative effects on daytime heat stress. The reflective pavement had better UHI performance but had high radiosity during daytime which can negatively affect pedestrian heat stress.</description>

      <title>Percolation analysis of spatio-temporal distribution of population in Seoul and Helsinki</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal distribution of urban population is crucial to understand the structure and dynamics of cities. Most studies, however, have focused on the microscopic structure of cities such as their few most crowded areas. In this work, we investigate the macroscopic structure of cities such as their clusters of highly populated areas. To do this, we analyze the spatial distribution of urban population and its intra-day dynamics in Seoul and Helsinki with a percolation framework. We observe that the growth patterns of the largest clusters in the real and randomly shuffled population data are significantly different, and highly populated areas during daytime are denser and form larger clusters than during nighttime. An analysis of the cluster size distributions at percolation criticality shows that their power-law exponents during daytime are lower than during nighttime, indicating that the spatial distributions of urban population during daytime and nighttime fall into different universality classes. Finally measuring the area-perimeter fractal dimension of the collection of clusters at criticality demonstrates that the fractal dimensions during daytime are higher than during nighttime, indicating that the perimeters of clusters during daytime are more rough than during nighttime. Our findings suggest that even the same city can have qualitatively different spatial distributions of population over time, and propose a way to quantitatively compare the macrostructure of cities based on population distribution data.</description>

      <title>Noisy information channel mediated prevention of the tragedy of the commons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synergy between evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and fluctuating state of shared resource being consumed by the cooperators is essential for averting the tragedy of the commons. Not only in humans, but also in the cognitively-limited organisms, this interplay between the resource and the cooperation is ubiquitously witnessed. The strategically interacting players engaged in such game-environment feedback scenarios naturally pick strategies based on their perception of the environmental state. Such perception invariably happens through some sensory information channels that the players are endowed with. The unfortunate reality is that any sensory channel must be noisy due to various factors; consequently, the perception of the environmental state becomes faulty rendering the players incapable of adopting the strategy that they otherwise would. Intriguingly, situation is not as bad as it sounds. Here we introduce the hitherto neglected information channel between players and the environment into the paradigm of stochastic evolutionary games with a view to bringing forward the counterintuitive possibility of emergence and sustenance of cooperation on account of the noise in the channel. Our primary study is in the simplest non-trivial setting of two-state stochastically fluctuating resource harnessed by a large unstructured population of cooperators and defectors adopting either memory-1 strategies or reactive strategies while engaged in repeated two-player interactions. The effect of noisy information channel in enhancing the cooperation in reactive-strategied population is unprecedented. We find that the propensity of cooperation in the population is inversely related to the mutual information (normalized by the channel capacity) of the corresponding information channel.</description>

      <title>The computational power of a human society: a new model of social evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social evolutionary theory seeks to explain increases in the scale and complexity of human societies, from origins to present. Over the course of the twentieth century, social evolutionary theory largely fell out of favor as a way of investigating human history, just as advances in complex systems science and computer science saw the emergence of powerful new conceptions of complex systems, and in particular new methods of measuring complexity. We propose that these advances in our understanding of complex systems and computer science should be brought to bear on our investigations into human history. To that end, we present a new framework for modeling how human societies co-evolve with their biotic environments, recognizing that both a society and its environment are computers. This leads us to model the dynamics of each of those two systems using the same, new kind of computational machine, which we define here. For simplicity, we construe a society as a set of interacting occupations and technologies. Similarly, under such a model, a biotic environment is a set of interacting distinct ecological and climatic processes. This provides novel ways to characterize social complexity, which we hope will cast new light on the archaeological and historical records. Our framework also provides a natural way to formalize both the energetic (thermodynamic) costs required by a society as it runs, and the ways it can extract thermodynamic resources from the environment in order to pay for those costs -- and perhaps to grow with any left-over resources.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices for measuring ex ante and ex post competitive balance in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while the ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>
