      <title>Dutch Disease and the Resource Curse: The Progression of Views from Exchange Rates to Women's Agency and Well-Being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the history of economic thought on natural resource extraction, which has long been considered an enclave industry with few benefits for areas beyond the local economy. We focus on more recent scholarship examining the social impacts of natural resource extraction, emphasizing gender-related outcomes and determinants. An important lesson from this scholarship is that it is difficult to discuss sustainable development in its contemporary sense without paying due diligence to the gender dimensions of natural resource extraction. A lesson highlighted is that the "resource curse" view of natural capital may not be as pervasive as previously thought.</description>

      <title>AI as Coordination-Compressing Capital: Task Reallocation, Organizational Redesign, and the Regime Fork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-based models of AI and labor hold organizational structure fixed, analyzing how technology shifts task assignments within a given firm architecture. Yet emerging evidence shows firms flattening hierarchies in response to AI adoption -- a phenomenon these models cannot generate. We extend the task-based framework by introducing agent capital (K_A): AI systems that reduce coordination costs within organizations, expanding managerial spans of control and enabling endogenous task creation. We derive five propositions characterizing how coordination compression affects output, hierarchy, manager demand, wage dispersion, and the task frontier. The model generates a regime fork: depending on whether agent capital complements all workers broadly (general infrastructure) or high-skill managers disproportionately (elite complementarity), the same technology produces either broad-based productivity gains or superstar concentration, with sharply divergent distributional consequences. Numerical simulations with heterogeneous managers and workers across a 2x2 parameter space (elite complementarity x endogenous task creation) confirm sharp regime divergence: in settings where coordination compression substantially expands employment, economy-wide inequality falls in all regimes, but the rate of reduction is regime-dependent and the manager-worker wage gap widens universally. The distributional impact of AI hinges not on the technology itself but on the elasticity of organizational structure -- and on who controls that elasticity.</description>

      <title>Can Wearable Exoskeletons Reduce Gender and Disability Gaps in the Construction Industry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The share of construction trade jobs held by women and people with disabilities has remained stubbornly low in the face of chronic shortages of skilled labor. This study explores the potential of wearable assistive technologies to reduce these disparities. We use U.S. worker-level data to estimate employment and wage differences by gender and by mobility/strength impairments in construction and non-construction jobs. We also use occupational-level data to examine variations in workforce composition, physical skill requirements, and earnings across detailed construction occupations. Regression estimates indicate that being a woman and having strength and mobility impairments are associated with substantial employment and pay gaps in construction compared to non-construction jobs. Further analysis shows a high negative correlation between the representation of women and the ability levels required in those occupations. Finally, we discuss several wearable exoskeletons under development for people with upper-body and lower-body impairments, focusing on how these innovations could be integrated into construction jobs. These findings suggest that wearable exoskeletons that enhance manual dexterity, balance, and strength may improve the representation of women and people with disabilities in some of the higher-paying occupations in construction.</description>

      <title>Costly Attention and Retirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.06520v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In UK data, I document the prevalence of misbeliefs regarding the State Pension eligibility age (SPA) and their predictivity for retirement. Exploiting policy variation, I estimate a lifecycle model of retirement in which, motivated by patterns in belief data, rationally inattentive households learning about uncertain pension policy endogenously generates misbeliefs. Misbeliefs explain 51% of the excessive (given financial incentives) drop in employment at SPA when constrained to replicate the belief data patterns and completely explain it when not. To achieve this, I develop a solution method for dynamic rational inattention models with persistent beliefs. Costly attention makes the SPA up to 15% less effective at increasing old-age employment. Hence, information letters improve welfare and increase employment.</description>

      <title>Household and individual economic outcomes of different health shocks: The role of medical innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides new evidence on how medical care mitigates the economic consequences of health shocks for individuals and their partners. To identify causal effects, I focus on medical scientific discoveries and exploit longitudinal administrative data for Sweden, using a triple differences design. The results indicate that medical innovation strongly mitigates the negative economic consequences of health shocks for individuals and have spillover effects on their partners. These spillovers are relatively large because medical innovation compensates for partners wage losses in conditions when welfare support for caregiving is insufficient. Overall, the findings indicate that medical innovation not only produces substantial economic gains but also reduces disease-related economic inequalities.</description>

      <title>Life-Cycle Effects of Comprehensive Sex Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the introduction of comprehensive sex education in Sweden as a natural experiment, we explore how educational curricula can shape social norms and impact personal well-being. Inspired by liberal values, the curriculum taught more than just biology. It instilled lessons on abstinence, rational family planning, and the importance of taking social responsibility for personal decisions. We find that the reform successfully addressed its intended outcomes, reducing unwanted pregnancies, leading to fertility postponements and increasing female labor force participation. The findings suggest that social norms, internalized through school-based sex education, persistently affect peoples outcomes in significant ways.</description>

      <title>Workers as Partners: a Theory of Responsible Firms in Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What happens when employers value worker welfare in frictional labor markets? We show this "responsibility" creates an endogenous wedge in the marginal labor cost -- akin to a hiring subsidy -- altering wage and vacancy incentives rather than only changing the surplus split. The wedge is strongest when outside options are weak and separations rare, implying larger wage premia in slack, low-mobility markets. In a wage-posting model with on-the-job search, responsible firms may occupy the high-wage segment even when less productive. In a DMP model, responsible firms commit to higher worker bargaining power, raising the value of unemployment and thereby wages at regular firms.</description>

      <title>Better Together? A Field Experiment on Human-Algorithm Interaction in Child Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite algorithms' potential to improve public services, adoption has been limited by concerns about effectiveness and equity. We conduct a randomized controlled trial ($N=4,681$) providing real-time algorithm support to Child Protective Services (CPS) workers allocating investigations. Algorithm access reduced maltreatment-related hospitalizations, especially among disadvantaged groups, while reducing CPS surveillance of Black children. Notably, child injury admissions decreased by 21 percent. Workers reallocated investigations toward children at greater likelihood of harm, without mechanically following algorithmic predictions. Discussion notes suggest the algorithm shifted worker attention to complementary information. Counterfactual exercises show that human-algorithm complementarity would outperform algorithmic automation in efficiency and equity.</description>

      <title>Demand Estimation with Text and Image Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20711v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a demand estimation approach that leverages unstructured data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a mixed logit demand model. This approach enables demand estimation even when researchers lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes such as visual design. Using a choice experiment, we show this approach substantially outperforms standard attribute-based models at counterfactual predictions of second choices. We also apply it to 40 product categories offered on Amazon.com and consistently find that unstructured data are informative about substitution patterns.</description>

      <title>Multigenerational Effects of Smallpox Vaccination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Swedish register data spanning 250 years, we estimate multigenerational effects of smallpox vaccination on longevity and occupational achievements. Employing mother fixed-effects, difference-in-differences, and shift-share instrumental-variables designs, we find vaccination improves outcomes for three generations. We explore mechanisms through which benefits transmit across generations, finding evidence consistent with both improved health behaviors and epigenetic inheritance. Effects persist even in milder disease environments, demonstrating vaccination lasting benefits beyond epidemic contexts. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for multigenerational returns when evaluating early-life health interventions.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: Characterizing Distributed Photovoltaic Panel Investment Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates long-term investment decisions in distributed photovoltaic panels by individual investors. We consider a setting where investment decisions are driven by expected revenue from participating in short-term electricity markets over the panel lifespan. These revenues depend on short-term market equilibria, i.e., prices and allocations, which are influenced by aggregate invested panel capacity participating in the markets. We model the interactions among investors by a non-atomic game and develop a framework that links short-term market equilibria to the resulting long-term investment equilibrium. Then, within this framework, we analyze three market mechanisms: (a) a single-product real-time energy market, (b) a product-differentiated real-time energy market that treats solar energy and grid energy as different products, and (c) a contract-based panel market that trades claims/rights to the production of certain panel capacity ex-ante, rather than the realized solar production ex-post. For each, we derive expressions for short-term equilibria and the associated expected revenues, and analytically characterize the corresponding long-term Nash equilibrium aggregate capacity. We compare the solutions of these characterizing equations under different conditions and theoretically establish that the product-differentiated market always supports socially optimal investment, while the single-product market consistently results in under-investment. We also establish that the contract-based market leads to over-investment when the extra valuations of users for solar energy are small. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A uniformity principle for spatial matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platforms matching spatially distributed supply to demand face a fundamental design choice: given a fixed total budget of service range, how should it be allocated across supply nodes ex ante, i.e. before supply and demand locations are realized, to maximize fulfilled demand? We model this problem using bipartite random geometric graphs where $n$ supply and $m$ demand nodes are uniformly distributed on $[0,1]^k$ ($k \ge 1$), and edges form when demand falls within a supply node's service region, the volume of which is determined by its service range. Since each supply node serves at most one demand, platform performance is determined by the expected size of a maximum matching. We establish a uniformity principle: whenever one service range allocation is more uniform than the other, the more uniform allocation yields a larger expected matching. This principle emerges from diminishing marginal returns to range expanding service range, and limited interference between supply nodes due to bounded ranges naturally fragmenting the graph. For $k=1$, we further characterize the expected matching size through a Markov chain embedding and derive closed-form expressions for special cases. Our results provide theoretical guidance for service-range allocation and incentive design in ride-hailing, on-demand labor markets, and drone delivery platforms, highlighting the benefits of reducing disparities in supply-side flexibility.</description>
