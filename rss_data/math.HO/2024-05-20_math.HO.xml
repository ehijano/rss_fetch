      <title>On M\=adhava and his correction terms for the M\=adhava-Leibniz series for $\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is intended to serve two purposes: one, to present an account of the life of Sangamagr\=ama M\=adhava, the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics which flourished during the 15th - 18th centuries, based on modern historical scholarship and two, to present a critical study of the three enigmatic correction terms, attributed to M\=adhava, for obtaining more accurate values of $\pi$ while computing its value using the M\=adhava-Leibniz series. For the second purpose, we have collected together the original Sanskrit verses describing the correction terms, their English translations and their presentations in modern notations. The Kerala rationale for these correction terms are also critically examined. The general conclusion in this regard is that, even though the correction terms give high precision approximations to the value of $\pi$, the rationale presented by Kerala authors is not strong enough to convince modern mathematical scholarship.
  The author has extended M\=adhava's results by presenting higher order correction terms which yield better approximations to $\pi$ than the correction terms attributed to M\=adhava. The various infinite series representations of $\pi$ obtained by M\=adhava and his disciples from the basic M\=adhava-Leibniz series using M\=adhava's correction terms are also discussed. A few more such series representations using the better correction terms developed by the author are also presented. The various conjectures regarding how M\=adhava might have originally arrived at the correction terms are also discussed in the paper.</description>

      <title>On \'Sankara Varman's (correct) and M\=adhava's (incorrect) values for the circumferences of circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines what computational procedures \'Sankara Varman (1774-1839) and Sangamagrama M\=adhava (c. 1340 - 1425), astronomer-mathematicians of the Kerala school, might have used to arrive at their respective values for the circumferences of certain special circles (a circle of diameter $10^{17}$ by the former and a circle of diameter $9\times 10^{11}$ by the latter). It is shown that if we choose the M\=adhava-Gregory series for $\tfrac{\pi}{6}=\arctan (\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{3}})$ to compute $\pi$ and then use it compute the circumference of a circle of diameter $10^{17}$ and perform the computations by ignoring the fractional parts in the results of every operation we get the value stated by \'Sankara Varman. It is also shown that, except in an unlikely case, none of the series representations of $\pi$ attributed to M\=adhava produce the value for the circumference attributed to him. The question how M\=adhava did arrive at his value still remains unanswered.</description>

      <title>A chronology of continued square roots and other continued compositions, through the year 2016</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06139</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.06139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite continued composition is an expression of the form \begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty}t_0\circ t_1 \circ t_2 \circ \cdots \circ t_n(c)\;, \end{equation*} where the $t_i$ are maps from a set $D$ to itself, the initial value $c$ is a point in $D$, and the order of operations proceeds from right to left.
  This document is a bibliography, in chronological order through the year 2016, of selected continued compositions whose primary sources have typically been obscure. In particular, we include continued square roots: \begin{equation*} a_0+\sqrt{a_1+\sqrt{a_2+\sqrt{\ldots}}}\;, \end{equation*} as well as continued powers, continued cotangents, continued logarithms, and $f$-expansions. However, we do not include continued fractions, continued exponentials, or forms such as infinite sums and products in which the $t_i$ are linear functions, because the literature on these forms is extensive.</description>
