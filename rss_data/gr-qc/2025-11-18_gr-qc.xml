      <title>On the Complexified Spacetime Manifold Mapping of AdS to dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a complex manifold, one can bridge anti-de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes via analytic continuation, preserving geometric invariants and regularity, avoiding singularities during the AdS-dS transition. It unifies gravitational and gauge interactions under a complexified symmetry group, maintaining bulk unitarity for both AdS and dS. Boundary unitarity is upheld in AdS but not in dS due to the spacelike conformal boundary. The theory uses holographic principles like the MacDowell-Mansouri and Quantum Extremal Surface prescriptions to align entanglement and black hole entropy with AdS/CFT and general relativity. HUFT provides insights into AdS and dS holography, the cosmological constant, and quantum gravity unitarity and entanglement.</description>

      <title>The Third Law of Black Hole Dynamics in Pure Lovelock Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third law of black hole dynamics states that it is impossible, through any finite sequence of physical processes, to reduce the surface gravity of a black hole to zero. In this work, we examine the validity of this law for static, spherically symmetric charged black holes in the pure Lovelock theory of gravity. By studying infinitesimal variations in mass and charge, we derive a set of inequalities that constrain these variations. Our analysis shows that as the surface gravity approaches zero ($\kappa \to 0$), the range of admissible perturbations gradually diminishes, thereby forbidding the attainment of extremality through any finite classical process. The saturation of the inequality is interpreted as the emergence of a dynamical barrier near extremality, which prevents further evolution toward the extremal configuration.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of Klein-Gordon Oscillator in the Context of Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the thermal and statistical properties of the one dimensional Klein-Gordon oscillator within two prominent Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) frameworks: Amelino-Camelia and Magueijo-Smolin. Using the modified dispersion relations specific to each formulation, we derive the positive energy spectra, construct the partition function via the Euler-Maclaurin method, and compute key thermodynamic quantities, including the specific heat $C_v$, as functions of temperature and the deformation scale. Planck-scale corrections produce distinct, theoretically resolvable shifts in both the position and magnitude of the $C_v$ peak in the two models. An accompanying entropy analysis reveals that these peaks correspond to smooth Schottky-type anomalies: the specific heat curves remain analytic and positive across the explored temperature range, and thus do not indicate latent or continuous thermodynamic phase transitions. These comparative results provide a robust diagnostic framework for differentiating DSR prescriptions in relativistic quantum systems and reinforce the transition-free character of their thermal response.</description>

      <title>Universality of Quasinormal-Mode Shifts from Small Nonlocal Effective Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate perturbative quasinormal-mode (QNM) shifts of black holes arising from fractional, nonlocal modifications to the wave operator. Starting from a scalar master equation corrected by a small fractional Laplacian term $(-\Delta)^{s}$ with $0&lt;s&lt;1$, we derive an analytic expression for the complex frequency shift at first order in the nonlocal coupling $\varepsilon$. Evaluation of the fractional operator in both coordinate and momentum representations reveals a universal scaling law $\delta\omega/\omega \propto \varepsilon/M^{2s}$, largely independent of the field spin, with an additional $\ell^{2s}$ enhancement in the eikonal regime $\ell \gg 1$. Applying the formalism to Schwarzschild, slowly rotating Kerr, Hayward regular, and LQG-corrected black holes, we demonstrate that the leading-order fractional QNM shift is universal, with geometric details entering only through overlap integrals of the mode functions. This universality provides a model-independent signature of nonlocality in strong-gravity ringdown spectra and offers a potential observational window into quantum-gravity-inspired modifications.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Black hole in Dehnen $(1,\,4,\,\frac{1}{2})$ dark matter halo: exact solution, lensing, light ring, and thermodynamics (EPJC 85 (2025) 1256)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article, the author of Ref. [EPJC 85 (2025) 1256] constructed an exact solution describing a static, spherically symmetric black hole embedded in a Dehnen-($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) type dark matter halo with the parameter choice $\alpha=1,\,\beta=4,\,\gamma=1/2$. The author first derived the density profile, which was subsequently integrated to obtain the mass profile, and this mass profile was then employed in constructing the exact metric solution. In this comment, we demonstrate that both the density profile and the mass profile obtained in Ref. [EPJC 85 (2025) 1256] contain fundamental mathematical errors that invalidate the subsequent analysis.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Holes Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study [1], authors introduced a new class of exact space-times in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external uniform magnetic field that is oriented along the rotational axis. Motivated by this work, we investigate a Kerr-like black hole solution with a cloud of strings surrounded by a uniform magnetic field. For the zero rotation case, the space-time reduces to the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson black hole with a cloud of strings. Moreover, for zero magnetic field, the metrics simplify to a Kerr-like black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings, and its static counterpart reduces to the Schwarzschild black hole with a cloud of strings.</description>

      <title>Testing general relativity with amplitudes of subdominant gravitational-wave modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved subdominant-mode amplitude (SMA) test of general relativity (GR), which probes amplitude-level deviations in the higher-order modes of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black hole mergers while keeping the dominant quadrupole mode fixed. Using a comprehensive parameter-estimation campaign, we benchmark the test against Gaussian noise fluctuations, waveform modeling systematics, and physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. When applied to numerical-relativity simulations, the SMA test performs reliably for aligned-spin and mildly precessing systems but exhibits measurable biases for strongly precessing or eccentric binaries. Although designed to detect amplitude deviations, the test also responds coherently to phase perturbations, yielding apparent GR violations when applied to phase-modified waveforms. Applied to recent GW detections, we report the strongest constraint on the hexadecapolar (4,4) mode amplitude deviation, $\delta A_{44} = -0.30^{+1.16}_{-3.45}$, consistent with GR. With these results, this work establishes the SMA test as a robust and broadly sensitive framework for probing strong-field gravity and demonstrates a systematic approach for assessing the robustness of GW tests of GR.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Bimetric Cosmology: A Minimal Extension of {\Lambda}CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a symmetric bimetric cosmological model connecting Anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) regimes through a coupled scalar field. Starting from a Lagrangian with Einstein-Hilbert terms for two FLRW metrics and an inter-metric potential, we derive modified Friedmann and Klein-Gordon equations governing their evolution. In the symmetric effective-fluid limit, the model reproduces the main phenomenology of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a small dynamical correction proportional to $(1+z)^{-3}$, and naturally satisfies local-gravity constraints through Vainshtein screening. This article outlines the theoretical structure and calibration of the model within a dual-geometry cosmological setting.</description>

      <title>Spin precession effects in the phasing formula of eccentric compact binary inspirals till the second post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves (GWs) can exhibit orbital eccentricity, along with generic spin orientations, leading to the precession of the orbital angular momentum, individual spins, and the orbital plane. While eccentric binaries with aligned spins are well studied, closed form post Newtonian (PN) expressions that simultaneously include eccentricity and precessing spin effects have remained unavailable. Eccentricity complicates orbital evolution because solving the coupled differential equations typically requires numerical integration, which slows down the generation of waveforms. We exploit the separation of timescales between orbital motion, spin precession, and radiation reaction, applying the precession averaging method of Morras et al. (2025) to remove explicit time dependence from the spin orbit and spin spin dynamics through the second PN order. Using this framework, we derive analytic phasing formulae from the evolution equations for orbital frequency and eccentricity, treating eccentricity as a small parameter. Closed form solutions for the eccentricity evolution and GW phase are obtained up to eighth order in the initial eccentricity. We also generalize the TaylorT2 approximant to include spin precession effects and compute the orbital phase in both time and frequency domains. To improve accuracy for moderate to high initial eccentricities, we perform a resummation of the TaylorT2 phasing. These results offer efficient, closed form phasing expressions that capture the coupled dynamics of eccentricity and precession, enabling more accurate and computationally tractable GW waveform modeling for data analysis.</description>

      <title>Relativistic framework for high-precision GNSS-based navigation in cislunar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a relativistic modeling framework for GNSS-based navigation in Geocentric and Barycentric Celestial Reference Systems, i.e., GCRS and BCRS, respectively. Using the IAU-adopted GCRS and BCRS conventions, we derive closed-form transformations for position, velocity, and acceleration that are required to achieve fractional-frequency transfer precision of 10^{-16} and sub-cm positional accuracy. Numerical simulations with GipsyX validate cm-level orbit determination and timing stability within tens of picoseconds across GCRS and BCRS and demonstrate mm-level round-trip GCRS &lt;--&gt; BCRS frame closure over 24 h. These results underscore the necessity of relativistic corrections for high-precision GNSS throughout the Earth-Moon system and demonstrate that GNSS signals can support a decimeter-level orbit accuracy and sub-nanosecond-scale timing synchronization in cislunar space, establishing a robust framework for future operations. We introduce the Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) and its associated time scale to extend GNSS-based navigation into cislunar space. We present a minimal cislunar case study (NRHO-like geometry) that applies the improved position/velocity/acceleration transformations and the light-time model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear evolution of anisotropic matter configurations under higher-order curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamical evolution of self-gravitating systems in the presence of exotic matter within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. Specifically, we have adopted the Starobinsky model $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$, which incorporates higher-order curvature corrections to describe nonlinear gravitational behavior. The analysis focuses on the nonlinear spherical evolution of anisotropic matter configurations and explains how dark matter influences their physical characteristics. The presence of dark matter is found to significantly affect the radial and tangential pressure distributions, thereby altering the overall dynamics of the system. The model is employed for the compact object $ Her~X-1$ described by the generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz metric, demonstrating a singularity-free behavior of the physical parameters. The results reveal that increasing the parameter $n$ of the generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz metric leads to striking variations in the model characteristics, highlighting its essential role in governing internal structure and evolution of the compact object. The model remains physically viable under different testing criteria like energy conditions, hydrostatic equilibrium condition, adiabatic index, causality conditions, Herrera's Cracking condition and mass-radius relation presented in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arguably one can use a canonical scalar field $\varphi$, minimally coupled to gravity, with quadratic potentials $V = \Lambda \pm \frac12 m^2\varphi^2$ to explore some general features of slow-roll and hilltop thawing quintessence, respectively. For each of these two potentials, and pressure-free matter, we introduce a regular unconstrained dynamical system on a compact state space, where the formulation for the hilltop case is new. Together with a derivation of monotonic functions in the two global state space settings, this enables us to obtain global results and to introduce figures that illustrate the global solution spaces of these models, in which we situate the observationally viable quintessence solutions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement degradation of static black holes in effective quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information science has been broadly explored in Einstein gravity and in various modified gravity theories; however, its extension to quantum gravity settings remains largely unexplored. Motivated by this gap, in this paper we investigate the degradation of quantum entanglement of scalar and Dirac fields in the third-type black hole geometry arising from effective quantum gravity, which incorporates generic quantum gravitational corrections beyond classical general relativity. This quantum corrected spacetime is free of a Cauchy horizon and can be cast into a Rindler form in the near-horizon regime, allowing a direct identification of vacuum modes and a clear correspondence with the framework developed for uniformly accelerated observers. Within this framework, we compute the quantum entanglement and mutual information of uniformly entangled detector pairs in terms of the quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$, the mode frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and Bob's radial position $R_0$. The quantum parameter $\tilde{\zeta}$ consistently weakens the horizon-induced loss of correlations. For scalar fields this effect is pronounced, producing clear departures from the classical behavior, whereas for Dirac fields the familiar correlation pattern remains intact but its degradation is noticeably reduced. Overall, $\tilde{\zeta}$ acts as a universal protective factor against gravitational suppression of quantum correlations. The third-type effective quantum black hole therefore provides a controlled and physically transparent arena for probing how quantum-gravity corrections influence relativistic quantum information.</description>

      <title>Long-lived quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of supermassive black holes with a dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a spherically symmetric galactic dark matter halo. The background metric, recently obtained as an analytic generalization of the Schwarzschild geometry, depends on the halo velocity parameter $V_{c}$ and the core radius $a$. Using the sixth- and seventh-order WKB methods with Pade approximants, supported by time-domain integration and Prony analysis, we compute the fundamental quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. The results show that the real part of the frequency slightly increases while the damping rate decreases with growing field mass $\mu$, leading to longer-lived oscillations. The influence of the dark matter halo parameters is found to be negligible for astrophysically realistic values, confirming the robustness of Schwarzschild-like ringdown signatures. Grey-body factors decrease with increasing field mass and multipole number, while the effect of the halo parameters remains small.</description>

      <title>The Unruh Effect in Relativistic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a relativistic-fluid counterpart of the Unruh effect, in which a comoving probe measures a \emph{Thermodynamic Unruh temperature}. Frame changes in first-order hydrodynamics can be recast as a local, time-dependent hyperbolic rotation in a Rindler-style state space; the instantaneous map between frames is the \emph{Thermodynamic Boost}, and its proper-time variation defines the \emph{Thermodynamic Acceleration} that imprints a thermal spectrum. Using the Israel--Stewart theory and extending it to modern relativistic fluid theories,we show that this temperature is frame-independent to leading order and universal for out-of-equilibrium relativistic fluids.</description>

      <title>Wormholes exact solutions in high dimensions General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we develop and examine a series of exact solutions to Einstein's 5-dimensional field equations in the vacuum, which depend on two constant parameters, $p$ and $q$, which generalize the solutions of L\"u and Mei [8] belonging to our class $p=2$. This category of solutions can be split into two sections: when $p$ is odd, it represents a compact object that may have naked singularities. However, the intriguing outcome occurs when $p$ is even, as asymptotically Ricci flat wormholes emerge in this scenario. The Kreschman invariant of these solutions depends on the constant parameter $l = 1 + \frac{3 q^2 - p^2}{4}$. When $l = 0$ and $l \leq -\frac{1}{2}$, the solutions are regular. For the specific cases where $l \leq 0$, or $l &gt; 0$ such that $q &lt; 0$ for $p \geq 2$, $q \leq \frac{1}{3}$ for $p = 2$, and $q \leq \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{3}$ for $ p \geq 4$, this class of wormholes adheres to Wormhole Cosmic Censorship, implying that the throat effectively obscures all causal anomalies and singularities. In our analysis, we investigated the embedded geometry, geodesics, singularities, potential event horizons, ergoregions, and the wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Black hole spacetimes with dark matter spikes: Energy-momentum tensor and backreaction effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the energy-momentum tensor of a dark matter (DM) spike formed during the adiabatic growth of a black hole embedded in a DM halo, and investigate its backreaction on the spacetime geometry. Within the Einstein cluster framework, we derive the complete tensor, explicitly incorporating the kinetic contribution to the energy density and the anisotropic pressure arising from noncircular particle orbits. Adopting the Hernquist profile as an illustrative model of DM halo and employing parameters appropriate to the Milky Way, we find that near the spike, the kinetic term enhances the total energy density by approximately $50\%$ relative to the rest-mass component, while the nonzero radial pressure induces a mild anisotropy in the stress tensor. The derived tensor satisfies all standard energy conditions. By treating it as a fixed source in Einstein' s equations, we numerically obtain a static, spherically symmetric metric that deviates from the Schwarzschild solution by an amount more than twice that found when only the mass density is considered. These results demonstrate that including the full dynamical structure of the DM spike is essential for accurately modeling the backreaction of DM on black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Catenoid Inspired Hyperbolic Wormhole Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil a novel class of traversable wormholes exhibiting exact spherical symmetry, geometrically inspired by the minimal surface structure of a catenoid. Introducing the spacetime metric, we rigorously derive its fundamental curvature properties, including the Riemann curvature tensor, and consequently compute the Einstein tensor and stress-energy tensor. This framework reveals that the wormhole is sustained by an anisotropic fluid. A detailed analysis of the energy conditions demonstrates the requisite presence of exotic matter, establishing the physical viability and constraints of this configuration. Subsequent investigations address the wormhole's traversability characteristics, gravitational lensing signatures, and dynamic stability. Crucially, we establish that this catenoid-inspired spacetime represents a finite wormhole, possessing bounded spatial extent.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Non-rotating Black Holes: Connecting the MST Formalism and Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of a black hole (BH) to tidal forces encodes key information about the underlying gravitational theory and affects the waveform of gravitational waves emitted during binary inspiral processes. In this paper, we analyze the dynamical tidal response of static and spherically symmetric BHs in a low-frequency regime within general relativity (GR), based on a matching between the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) methods for an analytical approach to BH perturbations and the worldline effective field theory (EFT) for an efficient and unified computation of the binary dynamics within the post-Newtonian regime. We show that the renormalized tidal response function is subject to inevitable ambiguities associated with the choice of renormalization scheme and with the initial condition of the renormalization flow equation. Once these ambiguities are fixed, we obtain scheme-dependent dynamical tidal Love numbers. We also discuss possible extensions of our formalism, including generic non-rotating compact objects (e.g., neutron stars) in GR and BHs in theories beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Auto-encoder model for faster generation of effective one-body gravitational waveform approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upgrades to current gravitational wave detectors for the next observation run and upcoming third-generation observatories, like the Einstein telescope, are expected to have enormous improvements in detection sensitivities and compact object merger event rates. Estimation of source parameters for a wider parameter space that these detectable signals will lie in, will be a computational challenge. Thus, it is imperative to have methods to speed-up the likelihood calculations with theoretical waveform predictions, which can ultimately make the parameter estimation faster and aid in rapid multi-messenger follow-ups. Towards this end, we present a conditional variational auto-encoder model, based on the best performing architecture of Liao+2021, for faster generation of aligned-spin SEOBNRv4 inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Our parameter space consists of four parameters, [$m_1$, $m_2$, $\chi_1(z)$, $\chi_2(z)$]. The masses are uniformly sampled in $[5,75]\,M_{\odot}$ with a mass ratio limit at $10\,M_{\odot}$, while the spins are uniform in $[-0.99,0.99]$. We train the model using $\sim10^5$ input waveforms data with a 70\%/10\% train/validation split, while 20\% data are reserved for testing. The median mismatch for the generated waveforms in the test dataset is $\sim10^{-2}$, with better performance in a restricted parameter space of $\chi_{\rm eff}\in[-0.80,0.80]$. Our model is able to generate 100 waveforms in 0.1 second at an average speed of about 4.46 ms per waveform. This is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than the native SEOBNRv4 implementation in lalsimulation. The latent sampling uncertainty of our model can be quantified with a mean mismatch deviation of $2\times10^{-1}$ for 1000 generations of the same waveform. Our work aims to be the first step towards developing a production-ready machine learning framework for the faster generation of gravitational waveform approximations.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical study of accretion processes around charged spherically symmetric black holes in scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical phenomena occurring around a spherically symmetric, non-rotating charged black hole (BH) to explore the effects of scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity on circular motion, accretion disk properties, and Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion flow. By analytically and numerically examining the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $c_1$ and the cosmological parameter $\Lambda$, we reveal how these modified gravity parameters alter the underlying physical processes. Using geodesic analysis, we compute the specific energy, angular momentum, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius, and radiation flux of test particles, providing insight into how the modified gravity framework affects orbital stability and the organization of the accretion flow. Subsequently, through numerical solutions of the general relativistic hydrodynamic (GRHD) equations, we describe the morphology of the shock cone formed via the BHL accretion mechanism around the BH. The numerical results demonstrate that increasing the values of $c_1$ and negative $\Lambda$ reduce gravitational focusing. Consequently, depending on the parameter choices, the opening angle of the shock cone either widens or narrows compared to the Schwarzschild case. However, because of weakened gravitational focusing, both the amount of accreted matter and the density of material trapped inside the cone decrease significantly. These results indicate that scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet corrections act as an effective gravitational damping term, transferring turbulence and transforming shock-dominated accretion into more stable configurations. The consistency between theoretical and numerical results suggests that the observable properties of accretion disks and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) can serve as probes to constrain the parameters of scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet gravity in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Null fluid gravitational fields on Kerr manifolds and optical lifts of Sasaki structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the characterisation in [C. D. Hill, J. Lewandowski and P. Nurowski, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 57 (2008), 3131--3176] of 4-dimensional Lorentzian metrics adapted to an optical structure and satisfying the null fluid Einstein equations, we give an explicit parameterisation of this class under the assumption that the optical structure is of Kerr type. As immediate consequences, we obtain: (1) a new method for constructing solutions to the Einstein equations with a null fluid energy momentum tensor, yielding a large family of explicit metrics that naturally includes the classical Kerr black hole metrics and all Ricci flat examples described in [M. Ganji, C. Giannotti, G. Schmalz and A. Spiro, Ann. Physics 75 (2025), Paper No. 169908, 28]; (2) a solution to a conjecture in Hill, Lewandowski and Nurowski's paper on the local existence of smooth optical lifts in the case of Sasaki CR structures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational aspects of a new bumblebee black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the physical consequences of a recently introduced black hole solution in bumblebee gravity [1]. The geometry is first presented and then reformulated through suitable coordinate adjustments, which make its global conical character evident. We then study the propagation of particles by solving the geodesic equations for null and timelike trajectories. The associated critical orbits (or photon spheres) are obtained, and shadow radius are computed and compared with other Lorentz-violating configurations in bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond models, including their charged and cosmological extensions. Massive particle motion is analyzed separately, followed by the construction of the effective potentials for scalar, vector, tensor, and spinor perturbations. These potentials allow the calculations of quasinormal frequencies and the corresponding time-domain evolution. Gravitational lensing phenomena are investigated in the weak and strong deflection regimes, and the light-travel time delay is also evaluated. The study concludes with bounds on the Lorentz-violating parameter based on classical Solar System experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal ringing of a regular black hole sourced by the Dehnen-type distribution of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasinormal modes of test scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac fields in the background of a new analytic regular black-hole solution obtained as an exact solution of the Einstein equations sourced by a Dehnen-type matter distribution in [R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, arXiv:2511.03066]. The metric is asymptotically flat and characterized by a simple lapse function $f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass and $a$ represents the characteristic scale of the surrounding dark-matter halo that regularizes the central region. The effective potentials for all perturbing fields possess the standard single-barrier form, ensuring linear stability and the applicability of the WKB formalism. The quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth- and ninth-order WKB methods with Pad\'e corrections and verified by time-domain integration, both approaches showing excellent agreement. The parameter $a$ leads to a moderate increase in the real oscillation frequency, while the damping rate remains almost unchanged, producing only small corrections to the Schwarzschild spectrum. Since such deviations become appreciable only for unrealistically dense halos, our results confirm that the quasinormal spectrum of astrophysical black holes is safely unaffected by ordinary galactic dark-matter environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reconstruction of Matched-Filter SNR Time Series from Nearby Templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for efficiently searching long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). The approach exploits the smooth frequency-domain behavior of ratios between neighboring waveform templates. The matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time series of a data segment is first computed for a reference template, and the SNRs of nearby templates are then reconstructed by convolving this reference SNR time series with the ratio waveforms, defined as the frequency-domain ratios between the reference and neighboring templates. The computational speedup arises because the ratio waveforms can be safely truncated: they are significant only over a short interval approximately equal to the duration difference between the templates. Storing these truncated ratio waveforms is practical and enables additional efficiency gains, in contrast to storing full templates, which is generally infeasible for long-duration, low-mass signals. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method with mock non-spinning CBC injections in the $1-3~M_\odot$ range. The reconstructed SNR time series agrees with that obtained from standard matched filtering to an accuracy of $O(10^{-4})$, while the relative computational cost is reduced by $\gtrsim 25\%$. With a truncation threshold of $10^{-3}$ applied to the ratio waveform amplitudes, the storage requirement is reduced by a factor of $\sim 60$ relative to storing the full template bank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of spacetime singularities, regions of infinite curvature where classical physics breaks down, is one of the most profound challenges in General Relativity (GR). In particular, black hole solutions such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics feature central singularities that signal the incompleteness of the theory in high curvature regimes. This thesis is devoted to the study of modified theories of gravity that aim to resolve these singularities and construct physically viable models of regular black holes: black holes that retain an event horizon but exhibit no curvature divergence anywhere in the spacetime ... Throughout the thesis, particular care is taken to ensure that the proposed models are physically sensible: they reduce to GR in the appropriate limits and lead to well behaved curvature scalars. Collectively, these results highlight the viability of regular black hole models in modified gravity theories, providing a promising path toward a consistent semiclassical description of black holes that avoids the need for quantum gravitational resolution of singularities.

      <title>Imaging Signatures of the Israel Junction: Photon Ring Evolution in Dynamical Thin Shell Schwarzschild Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the images of black holes by gluing two Schwarzschild spacetimes with a thin shell where the Israel junction conditions are satisfied. By studying the refraction law for null geodesics at the spherical shell, and taking account of the light travel time delay, the images are obtained by ray tracing a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk. For a static shell we identify three signatures: a redshift cusp at the shell, a V-shaped profile of the transfer function $r(b)$, and a loss of the one-to-one correspondence between photon spheres and photon rings on the observer's screen. During the collapse of the shell, the spacetime evolves from a stage with a single photon sphere inside the shell, through an intermediate stage with double photon spheres, and finally to a spacetime with a single photon sphere outside the shell. However, when the shell is released from a large distance, the corresponding images never show two separate photon rings, even in the stage with two photon spheres. In addition, the motion of the shell leads to a discontinuity in the redshift factor. These signatures provide a practical basis for testing the Israel junction in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Radius of Innermost Stable Circular Orbit in Higher-Dimensional Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) offers a fundamental test of spacetime structure. However, its behavior in higher-dimensional black holes influenced by anisotropic energy-momentum tensors remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we investigate the upper bound of the ISCO in higher-dimensional, static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes in the presence of an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. The energy-momentum tensor is assumed to satisfy the weak energy condition, possess a non-positive trace, and obey constraints on radial and tangential pressures, collectively equivalent to the dominant energy condition with additional constraints. By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics and imposing ISCO conditions, we demonstrate the general absence of an upper bound on the ISCO radius in higher-dimensional spacetimes. For dimensions greater than or equal to eight, an ISCO may not exist, depending on the radial and tangential components of the energy-momentum tensor. If an ISCO exists, its radius remains unbounded. These findings advance our understanding of orbital stability in higher-dimensional gravitational systems and highlight fundamental differences from four-dimensional black hole dynamics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Sub-Solar Mass Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals: Waveform Systematics and Detection Prospects with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the detectability and waveform systematics of sub-solar mass intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (SSM-IMRIs), characterized by mass ratios $q \sim 10^2-10^4$. Using the black hole perturbation theory surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} as a reference, we assess the performance of the \textsc{IMRPhenomX} phenomenological family in the high-mass-ratio regime. We find that the inclusion of higher-order gravitational wave modes is critical; their exclusion may degrade the signal-to-noise ratio by factors of $\sim3-5$ relative to quadrupole-only templates. With optimal mode inclusion, SSM-IMRIs are observable out to luminosity distances of $\sim575$ Mpc ($z\sim0.12$) with Advanced LIGO and $\sim10.5$ Gpc ($z\sim1.4$) with the Einstein Telescope. However, we identify substantial systematic uncertainties in current phenomenological approximants. Matches between \textsc{IMRPhenomX} and the reference surrogate model \textsc{BHPTNRSur1dq1e4} degrade to values as low as 0.2 for edge-on inclinations, and fitting factors consistently fall below 0.9, indicating a significant loss of effectualness in template-bank searches. Bayesian parameter estimation reveals that these modeling discrepancies induce systematic biases that exceed statistical errors by multiple standard deviations, underscoring the necessity for waveform models calibrated to perturbation theory in the intermediate mass-ratio regime for robust detection and inference.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of continuous spacetime extensions in 1+1 dimensions with applications to weak null singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by weak null singularities in black hole interiors, we study 1+1 dimensional Lorentzian manifolds $(M,g)$ which admit a continuous spacetime extension across a null boundary $v=0$, where $v&lt;0$ is a null coordinate. We study the degree to which such extensions are unique up to the boundary. Firstly, we find that in general not even the $C^0$-structure of the extension is uniquely determined by the assumption that the metric extends continuously. However, we exhibit an interesting local-global relation regarding the $C^0$-structure which in particular entails its rigidity for ''strongly spherically symmetric'' continuous extensions across the Cauchy horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. Secondly, we construct continuous extensions which have the same $C^0$-structure, but do not have equivalent $C^1$-structures. This construction also carries over to weak null singularities in 3+1 dimensions. Understanding the uniqueness properties of continuous spacetime extensions to the boundary is of importance for the study of low-regularity inextendibility problems.</description>

      <title>Emergent spectral geometry in the Coherence--Curvature Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Coherence--Curvature Model (CCM), a dynamical ensemble of connected graphs governed by a Hamiltonian that couples algebraic connectivity, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, and an edge-density penalty. Using connected simulated annealing we generate low-energy graph configurations and characterize their emergent geometry through the spectral dimension (ds), the Hausdorff dimension (dh), and the average distance. Finite-size scaling shows a clear growth of ds with system size, while dh increases more mildly. At the largest volumes explored the data are compatible with ds ~ 4 and dh ~ 3, implying ds &gt; dh and a nontrivial hierarchy between spectral and volumetric notions of dimension. We also map the dependence on the curvature coupling gamma and the locality coupling beta, and we find a slow power-law growth of typical distances with a small exponent eta. The CCM therefore provides a controlled numerical laboratory in which the interplay of coherence, curvature, and locality yields finite-dimensional, fractal-like geometries.</description>

      <title>The asymptotically Schwarzschild-like metric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the properties of the asymptotically Schwarzschild-like metric as an alternative to the Schwarzschild solution in General Relativity. While asymptotically flat and similar to Schwarzschild at large distances $r$, this metric exhibits a fundamentally different strong-field behavior: it lacks an event horizon and is best interpreted as a traversable wormhole or a black hole surrounded by a specific anisotropic fluid, rather than a true vacuum solution. We analyze key phenomenological features, demonstrating significant deviations from Schwarzschild in the radii of the photon sphere and the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO). Furthermore, we derive the Regge-Wheeler equation for gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations and compute the black hole shadow, providing a direct comparison with the Schwarzschild metric. Despite being ruled out by solar system tests, the exponential metric remains relevant for theories beyond standard GR, regular black hole models, and its connection to screened Yukawa potentials.</description>

      <title>On the General Projective Theory of Matter and Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a generalized projective gauge theory of gravity and spinorial matter, incorporating both non-metricity and torsion. The work is divided into three parts. Part I provides a thorough review of General Relativity, Metric-Affine gauge theory and Thomas-Whitehead (TW) Gravity. Part II constructs a gauge gravitational theory based on the Projective General Linear Group, wherein the newly found projective symmetric teleparallel (PST) connections are defined. Generalizing to non-inertial frames, and using nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to implement local Lorentz symmetry, we construct a general geometric framework that unifies TW and Metric-Affine gravity with projectively invariant spacetime torsion. We introduce projective generalized Higgs fields and show how certain gauge choices reduce these to fundamental projective fields, and how they may be used to define fundamental geometric objects such as the projective 2-frame and spacetime connection. A Lovelock-inspired action is shown to support only curvature (metric) dynamics, implying a topologically constrained Schouten field via the Pontrjagin density. The projective Pontrjagin density is shown to contain a new topological invariant, not present in the literature. Part III formulates projective spinors by defining gamma matrices via the projective linear group metric, then employing nonlinear gauge symmetry realizations to ensure local Lorentz covariance. A general spinor metric introduces a complex phase of redundancy. Requiring a real, Hermitian action leads to a projective Einstein-Cartan-type theory. An induced chiral mass emerges without CP violation.</description>

      <title>Bimodular Gravity: Unimodularising Bimetric Scalar-Tensor Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is the object of the present paper to unimodularise a disformal bimetric scalar-tensor theory, thereby defining what we call bimodular gravity. We impose one unimodular constraint per metric via multipliers $\lambda_{1,2}$ and show that two natural implementations-a dual fixed-determinant (BUG) and a dual diffeomorphism-invariant (BHT/BDUG) formulation-are classically inequivalent. In BUG the relative volume element $\nu=\sqrt{1-2BX}$ is fixed, enforcing a kinematic constraint on the biscalar and we derive the "bimodular cosmological constant" $\Lambda=\lambda_1+\nu\lambda_2$. In BHT/BDUG, $\lambda_{1,2}$ are individually constant but $\nu$ (hence $BX$) remains dynamical. Recasting the theory in an Einstein-frame form, we derive the biscalar sound speed and identify a subluminal domain $1+B(V+\lambda_2)&gt;0$. At the background level, BUG admits constant-roll solutions governed by first-order flow, whereas BHT supports solutions with time-dependent roll. These structural differences yield distinct, in-principle testable predictions for the expansion history, the dark-energy equation of state, and the propagation of biscalar perturbations. Finally, we present a diffeomorphism-invariant completion that correlates the two HT volume forms, reproducing the $\Lambda$ of BUG on shell whilst maintaining full covariance.</description>

      <title>Gravitational--Electromagnetic Coupling on Kerr Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous metric-based Schwarzschild studies of gravitational--electromagnetic (GEM) coupling to rotating black holes by working directly in a curvature-based Newman--Penrose/Teukolsky framework on Kerr spacetime. Within a minimally coupled Einstein--Maxwell system, we derive explicit quadratic electromagnetic source terms for the spin-$-2$ Teukolsky equation, providing a foundation for future numerical studies of GEM interactions in the framework of black-hole spectroscopy. Moreover, we give order-of-magnitude arguments showing that GEM quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs) can become relevant in a range of charged and magnetized astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we show through a brief dilaton-theory example that the GEM QQNM spectrum is sensitive to how gravity couples to electromagnetism, thereby providing a model-based way to test minimal coupling and to constrain hidden $U(1)$ sectors with gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the graviton propagator in de Sitter space in a one-parameter family of noncovariant gauges. This family generalizes the simple gauge in which most graviton loop computations in de Sitter space have been performed. The resulting propagator has a relatively simple form and will facilitate checks of the gauge dependence of one-loop computations and proposed observables.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Maxwell fields as solutions of Einstein gravity coupled to conformally invariant non-linear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Einstein-Maxwell (non-null) sourcefree configurations that can be extended to any conformally invariant non-linear electrodynamics (CINLE) by a constant rescaling of the electromagnetic field. We first obtain a criterion which characterizes such extendable solutions in terms either of the electromagnetic invariants, or (equivalently) of the canonical Newman-Penrose form of the self-dual Maxwell field. This is then used to argue that all static configurations are extendable (more generally, all configurations admitting a non-null twistfree Killing vector field). One can thus draw from the extensive literature to straightforwardly extend to CINLE various known exact solutions, whereby the duality invariance of the Einstein-Maxwell theory allows for dyonic solutions even in more general theories. This is illustrated by a few explicit examples, including the homogeneous $\Lambda&lt;0$ universe of Ozsv\'ath, a black hole in the universe of Levi-Civita, Bertotti and Robinson, a generalization of the charged $C$-metric, and non-expanding gravitational waves in the Bonnor-Melvin background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Analyticity of the Black Hole S-Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the analytic structure of the S-matrix in the complex-frequency plane for classical wave scattering on a Schwarzschild background in four space-time dimensions. Our argument relies on the analytic continuation of the gravitational potential, with the singularity behind the horizon playing a crucial role. We find that in the lower half-plane the partial-wave amplitudes are analytic except for the quasinormal-mode poles and the branch cut associated with late-time tails. As a direct consequence of causality, the retarded Green's function and absorption amplitude are analytic in the upper-half plane. We show, however, that Stokes phenomena can obstruct this analyticity domain from carrying over to the elastic amplitude, which instead develops a branch-cut in the upper-half plane. We also determine the effect of infrared (IR) regulators on the analytic structure, showing that polynomial boundedness requires a sharp lower bound on the IR cutoff in terms of the Schwarzschild radius.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Reconstruction of the Hubble Parameter from the Fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog and DESI Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The release of the fourth Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration includes more than 200 compact binary coalescence (CBC) candidates that can be used to probe the cosmic expansion. The population of merging binary black holes has been used so far to provide a constraint on the Hubble constant and dark matter fraction under the hypothesis of a flat-$\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter Universe.
  In this work, we provide the first non-parametric constrain on the Hubble parameter from 137 dark sirens reported in GWTC-4.0. We employ the relation between detector and source frame masses for detected GW signals, to obtain a statistical redshift evaluation for the population of binary black holes (BBHs). We model the Hubble parameter as a non-parametric autoregressive process in terms of the scale factor, using splines. In addition, we introduce two novel features: the use of \textit{anchor} points for $H(z)$ derived from an external probe - here, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) - and a constraining power coefficient that quantifies where the inference is most data-driven by GW detections.
  We highlight three key findings: (i) using GWs alone, the Hubble parameter determination is the most GW-data-driven around redshift $z = 0.44$, yielding to $H(0.44) = 92.3_{-36.6}^{+29.9}\rm\, km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$. Its value at $z = 0$, the Hubble constant, is therefore less constrained by the GW data. (ii) The Hubble parameter inferred from analyses assuming a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmological model is strongly affected by the cosmological model assumption. (iii) Introducing an anchor point for $H(z)$ enhances the inferred constraints and provides a clear visualization of the redshift range where GWs contribute most to the constraining power.</description>

      <title>Inflation without an Inflaton II: observational predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete computation of the scalar power spectrum in the \emph{inflation without inflaton} (IWI) framework, where the inflationary expansion is driven solely by a de~Sitter (dS) background and scalar fluctuations arise as second-order effects sourced by tensor perturbations. By explicitly deriving and numerically integrating the full second-order kernel of the Einstein equations, we obtain a scale-invariant scalar spectrum without invoking a fundamental scalar field. In this framework, the amplitude of the scalar fluctuations is directly linked to the scale of inflation. More precisely, we show that matching the observed level of scalar fluctuations, $\Delta_{\phi}^2(k_\ast)\approx 10^{-9}$ at Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales, fixes the inflationary energy scale $H_{\rm inf}$ as a function of the number of observed e-folds $N_{\rm obs}$. For $N_{\rm obs}\simeq 30 - 60$, we find $H_{\rm inf} \simeq 5\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV} - 2\times 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.01 - 5\times 10^{-9}$. In particular, requiring consistency with instantaneous reheating, we predict a number of e-folds of order~$\mathcal{O}(50)$ and an inflationary scale $H_{\rm inf} \simeq 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. We also incorporate in our framework the quantum break-time of the dS state and show that it imposes an upper bound on the number of particle species. Specifically, using laboratory constraints on the number of species limits the duration of inflation to $N_{\rm obs}\lesssim 126$ e-folds. These results establish the IWI scenario as a predictive and falsifiable alternative to standard inflaton-driven models, linking the observed amplitude of primordial fluctuations directly to the quantum nature and finite lifetime of dS space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive relativistic Maxwell-Bloch equations for potential applications in astronomical environments, where various radiative processes are known to occur, including the maser action and Dicke's superradiance. We show that for both phenomena a radiating system's response is preserved at different relative velocities between the system's rest frame and the observer, while the relevant timescales and the radiation intensity transform as expected from relativistic considerations. We verify that the level of coherence between groups of emitters travelling at different speeds is unchanged in all reference frames. We also derive relativistic versions of the maser equations applicable in the steady-state regime.</description>

      <title>The fate of Schwarzschild--de Sitter black holes: nonequilibrium evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytic treatment of Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) black-hole evaporation in two-dimensional dilaton gravity with anomaly-induced backreaction. Starting from the spherical reduction of four-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, we construct an exactly solvable 2D model that captures the full causal and thermodynamic structure of the SdS static patch, including both black-hole and cosmological horizons. Incorporating the trace anomaly of $N$ conformal matter fields via the Polyakov action, we determine the evolution of the black-hole mass and geometry in the Unruh--de Sitter state, track the steady nonequilibrium Hawking flux, and compute local thermodynamic observables for static observers. The conserved Killing energy flux drives an irreversible heat current from the black hole to the cosmological horizon whenever their surface gravities differ, ensuring monotonic entropy growth and satisfaction of the generalized second law. We prove that $\kappa_b &gt; \kappa_c$ throughout the physical static patch, so the only zero-flux configuration is the Nariai limit where the horizons coincide. Extending the framework to the quantum-information regime, we construct a thermally controlled estimate of the Page curve and show how quantum extremal surfaces and entanglement islands emerge naturally within the anomaly-induced steady state. These results constitute a fully analytic, backreacted solution for SdS evaporation that unifies semiclassical thermodynamics and information flow in a cosmological setting, thereby elucidating the ultimate fate of evaporating black holes in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Disk mass predictions for binary neutron star mergers: limitations of proposed symbolic regression models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling disk formation and mass ejection in binary neutron star systems is an important component in the construction of models for the electromagnetic signals powered by these events. Most models rely on analytical formulae for the disk mass and dynamical ejecta that are fitted to the results of numerical simulations, yet these fits have large uncertainties that significantly limit our ability to extract information from merger observations. In a recent manuscript, Darc et al claim that disk mass formulae constructed using symbolic regression outperform existing formulae and robustly extend to regions of the parameter space outside of the fitting region. I show here that the improvement over the most directly comparable existing model comes mostly from the use of different error measures in optimizing the fitting parameters. For the limited training data used so far, that existing fitting formula has a performance similar to symbolic regression models when optimized over the same error measure. More importantly, I show that many of the formulae obtained through symbolic regression provide unphysical results when used over the whole range of parameters relevant to the modeling of binary neutron star mergers, making them dangerous to use within parameter estimation pipelines. I conclude that fitting formulae with more physics input (e.g. Lund et al 2025), albeit certainly imperfect, remain safer to use in data analysis than these symbolic regression results. Symbolic regression results used in conjunction with careful physics-based vetting may however outperform them in the future.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</description>

      <title>The conditional probabilities and the empirical laws in a free scalar QFT in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike QFT in Minkowski spacetime (QFTM), QFT in curved spacetime (QFTCS) suffers from a conceptual obscurity on the empirical (experimentally verifiable/falsifiable) laws. We propose to employ the notion of prior conditional probabilities to describe a part of the empirical laws of QFTCS. This is interpreted as a quantum conditional probability without no information on the initial state. Hence this notion is expected to be free from the inevitable vagueness of the empirical meaning of quantum states in QFTCS. More generally in quantum physics, this notion seems free from the conceptual problems on state reductions. We confine ourselves to the probabilistic laws of the free scalar fields (Klein-Gordon fields) in curved spacetime, which require some reconsideration on the empirical meaning of the canonical commutation relation (CCR). We give some examples of empirical laws in terms of prior conditional probabilities, concerning the CCR and the free scalar QFTCS.</description>

      <title>Clustering effects on the Dark Siren determination of $H_0$: A simulation study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) offer an alternative way to measure the Hubble parameter. The optimal technique, the ``bright siren'' approach, requires the identification of an electromagnetic counterpart. However, a significant fraction of gravitational waves signals will not have counterparts. Such events can still constrain the Hubble parameter $H_0$ via statistical methods, exploiting galaxy information from the GWs sky localisation volume. In this work, we investigate the power of this method using high-resolution, cosmological simulations that include realistic clustering. We find that clustering leads to increased convergence of the $H_0$ posteriors, with clear recovery of the input value as early as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events, compared to uniform catalogues, where the posterior remains largely unconstrained, even with $N_{\rm gw}=100$ events. In addition, we quantify the role of catalogue incompleteness. We show that catalogues with completeness levels as low as $f=25\%$ can be competitive with fully complete catalogues, confirming the impact of clustering. Completeness levels of $f=50\%$ perform statistically similar to complete catalogues with as few as $N_{\rm gw}=40$ events. This indicates the need to focus on improving gravitational waves detection capabilities, rather than obtaining more complete galaxy catalogues. Finally, we investigate additional properties of the method by taking into consideration physical weights, different observational errors, potential biases from the $H_0$ priors, a variety of detectors' horizon distances, and different methods of catalogue completion and statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>IR/UV mixing from higher-order interactions in a Scalar Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the calculated cosmological constant, when regularized with a cutoff, differs hugely from the measured value. These calculations are made on the basis of a wave-vector cut-off that is usually set at the Planck scale. Further, Weinberg's no-go theorem indicates that in the presence of translational invariance, local quantum field theories cannot produce a zero cosmological constant without fine-tuning. Various non-local theories have been constructed, starting from modifications to Einstein's equations, in order to `cancel' away the cosmological constant term. There is also a well-known theory, due to Coleman, that assumes one can compute a probability distribution function for baby universes connected by wormholes that has the most probable value of the constant to be zero under some assumptions. The current paper starts from a QFT in 4-dimensions, breaks translational invariance by confining the fields to a box and adds a marginal (in power-counting terms) non-linear, momentum-dependent term that dominates the dynamics produced by the quadratic terms in the high-energy limit. It immediately produces an equation for the wave-vector cutoff applicable to the theory - the equation is reminiscent of that from UV/IR mixing and it effectively lowers the cutoff massively for a box the size of the Universe. However, as will be shown, the wave-vector cutoff for a box relevant for regular particle physics experiments is much larger, in fact, the Planck scale, so there is no conflict with current experiments, including the Casimir effect. We consider several possibilities for these additional terms and conclude that only one is relevant to a low cut-off. We also make a connection to the recent DESI results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first note that, at least in perturbation theory, there is a well-defined (subject to regularization) Lorentzian definition of the quantum effective action in both flat and curved space including (perturbative) gravity. The advantage of the latter is that we do not need to deal with the conformal factor problems of Euclidean quantum gravity. We then make some remarks on the Euclidean version (in flat space) and convexity and resolve a puzzle that highlights the importance of keeping the initial and final states in the functional integral. Next we discuss the gauge invariant effective action of Vilkovisky and DeWitt and show its gauge fixing independence. We conclude with the expression for the Wilsonian effective action in this framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of bulk metric reconstruction in holography by leveraging the inverse scattering framework applied to boundary two-point correlation functions. We generalize our previous work of scalar field and show that reconstruction can be achieved using a single operator rather than a pair. We also apply this method into reconstruction of static homogeneous anisotropic black holes and the reconstruction using correlation function of gauge field. In addition, we analyze the method's robustness under measurement noise and propose filtering strategies to improve reconstruction accuracy. This work advances data-driven bulk reconstruction by providing a concrete, experimentally viable pathway to recover spacetime geometry from field-theoretic observables.</description>

      <title>Redshifting the Cosmological Constant in Unimodular Gravity via Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological constant problem represents a profound conflict between quantum field theory and general relativity. Unimodular gravity offers a compelling starting point by de-gravitating the vacuum energy of the Standard Model, but this framework traditionally trades the problem of vacuum energy for a fine-tuning of initial conditions, which manifest as a ``shadow" cosmological constant. In this paper, we resolve this initial conditions problem by proposing a novel modification to gravity based on nonlinear quantum mechanics. We introduce specific state-dependent terms to the Hamiltonian, constructed from expectation values of the metric such as the average Ricci scalar. These terms alter the dynamical equations of gravity such that the shadow energy density associated with unconstrained initial conditions redshifts away with cosmic expansion, rendering it negligible at late times. The resulting cosmology is naturally dominated by matter and radiation without fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this significant infrared modification of gravity is consistent with local and cosmological tests of gravity. We comment on the possibility of testing this solution in cosmological measurements of Newton's constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the accretion process and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter (DM) halo. We examine the influence of the density {\rho}_{s} and radius r_{s} of the DM halo on key disk properties, including the energy flux, temperature distribution, and emission spectrum. Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing {\rho}_{s} or r_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters {\rho}_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the accretion disk becomes colder and dimmer as the DM halo parameters increase, highlighting the significant role of DM in shaping BH observables.</description>

Abstract: Combined measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), have recently challenged the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, indicating potential evidence for a dynamical dark energy component. These results are usually obtained in the context of the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameterizations, generally implying in phantom-crossing at intermediate redshifts. However, a general mapping between these parameterizations that yields approximately the same background observables clouds the inference of the true nature of dark energy in the context of these parametric methods. In this work, we propose a model-independent reconstruction of the dark energy density, which is more directly constrained than its EoS, based on the Gaussian Process (GP) regression method with the use of DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 SN Ia samples. In addition, we perform a statistical comparison between the energy densities of $\Lambda$, a non-phantom thawing quintessence-type dark energy, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterization with the reconstructed function. We find that all models agree with the GP reconstruction at 95\% C.L., with the largest discrepancy coming from $\Lambda$CDM with DESY5 at low redshifts. Even in this case, our findings suggest that it may be premature to claim statistically significant evidence for evolving or phantom dark energy with current DESI and SN Ia measurements.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hitherto unexplored neutrino background emerging from the mechanism of quenched superradiance of rotating primordial black holes. The quenching of the phenomenon happens through fermionic production, in our case neutrino production, from the boson cloud formed due to superradiance. The couplings involved in these interactions are bounded from above through several studies. In this work we put lower bounds on such scalar and vector couplings.</description>

Abstract: The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star--BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of ~2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 2.42 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Holographic Dark Energy with Torsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the holographic dark energy model with axial torsion which satisfy the cosmological principle. Subsequently, by using the torsional analogues of Friedmann equations for the new equation from Einstein-Cartan gravity theory, we obtain the equation of state for dark energy in this model. We find that the extended holographic dark energy from the particle horizon as the infrared (IR) cut-off does not give the accelerating expansion of the universe. Also, employing the future event horizon as IR cut-off still achieves the accelerating expansion of the universe. In contrast, there is a possibility that the Hubble radius as IR cut-off achieves to the accelerating expansion of the universe in superluminal region for axial torsion. More precisely, the current value of ratio for torsion to the matter density, $\gamma^{0}=0.5$ gives the equation of state of dark energy $\omega_{\Lambda}\cong-1$.</description>

      <title>The need for a nonlocal expansion in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities for wide-extended rotating bodies, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity might be needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effects.</description>

      <title>Non-interacting holographic dark energy with Torsion via Hubble Radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconstruct a holographic dark energy model within a Friedmann cosmology incorporating torsion scalar, assuming no interaction between dark energy and dark matter. Setting the Hubble radius as an infrared (IR) cut-off, we focus on a system dominated by contribution of a time-dependent torsion scalar induced by the spin of matter. In this regime, our results show that even very weak torsion causes cosmic acceleration. Specifically, we find that minima of the current equation of state for holographic dark energy, $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$, lies in the range $-1 &lt; (\omega_X^{0})_{min} &lt; -0.778$ as a free parameter $d$ varies from $1$ to $0.654$. Focusing on the free parameter $d \approx 1$, we find that $(\omega_X^{0})_{min}$ exhibits slightly different behavior from the cosmological constant. Introducing torsion allows the Hubble radius to serve as a viable IR cut-off even without assuming the interaction between them. Moreover, this approach provides a non-interacting limit not found in earlier interacting models that use the Hubble radius as the IR cut-off.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating corrections to the orbital precession of binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we test for gravitational parity violation in the PSR J1141-6545 system by analyzing the orbital plane inclination precession induced by the misalignment between the white dwarf's spin axis and the system's total angular momentum. Using the parity-violating metric of gravity that incorporates terms from both the exterior and boundary of the field source, we calculated corrections to the relative acceleration and orbital inclination precession rates, which exhibit significant deviations from the GR prediction. The parity-violating contributions depend on the projection of the spin vector along the orbital angular momentum direction, contrasting with GR, where it depends on the projection within the orbital plane. The corrections are perpendicular to GR contribution, highlighting a fundamental distinction. The exterior field correction is linear in the theoretical parameter and coupled to eccentricity $e$, while the boundary term correction is quadratic. By comparing these corrections with GR and incorporating observational uncertainty, we derive the constraint on the theoretical parameter, yielding $ \dot{f}_{\rm PV}\lesssim 10^6~ \rm m$.</description>

Abstract: Palatini $F(R,X)$ gravity, with $X$ the inflaton kinetic term, proved to be a powerful framework for generating asymptotically flat inflaton potentials. Here we show that a quadratic Palatini $F(R,X)$ restores compatibility with the observational data of the Peebles-Vilenkin quintessential inflation model. Moreover, the same can be achieved with an exponential version of the Peebles-Vilenkin potential if embedded in a Palatini $F(R,X)$ of order higher than two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole quasinormal mode frequencies can be very close to each other ("avoided crossings") or even completely degenerate ("exceptional points") when the system is characterized by more than one parameter. We investigate this resonant behavior and demonstrate that near exceptional points, the two modes are just different covers of the same complex function on a Riemann surface. We also study the characteristic time domain signal due to the resonance in the frequency domain, illustrating the analogy between black hole signals at resonance and harmonic oscillators driven by a resonant external force. We consider a specific toy model displaying a resonance between the fundamental mode and the first overtone, and we find that taking into account the linear growth in time due to the resonance is necessary to accurately recover the quasinormal mode frequencies.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) originating from cosmological sources offer direct insights into the physics of the primordial Universe, the fundamental nature of gravity, and the cosmic expansion of the Universe. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive overview of our recent advances in GW cosmology, supported by the national key research and development program of China, focusing on cosmological GW sources and their implications for fundamental physics and cosmology. We first discuss the generation mechanisms and characteristics of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds generated by physical processes occurred in the early Universe, including those from inflation, phase transitions, and topological defects, and summarize current and possible future constraints from pulsar timing array and space-based detectors. Next, we explore the formation and observational prospects of primordial black holes as GW sources and their potential connection to dark matter. We then analyze how GWs are affected by large-scale structure, cosmological perturbations, and possible modifications of gravity on GW propagation, and how these effects can be used to test fundamental symmetry of gravity. Finally, we discuss the application of GW standard sirens in measuring the Hubble constant, the expansion history, and dark energy parameters, including their combination with electromagnetic observations. These topics together show how GW observations, especially with upcoming space-based detectors, such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin, can provide new information about the physics of the early Universe, cosmological evolution, and the nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>MatBYIB: A Matlab-based code for Bayesian inference of extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary with arbitrary eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05954v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate parameter estimation(PE) of gravitational waves(GW) is essential for GW data analysis. In extreme mass-ratio inspiral binary(EMRI) systems, orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for PE. However, current software for for PE of GW often neglects the direct estimation of orbital eccentricity. To fill this gap, we have developed the MatBYIB, a MATLAB-based software package for PE of GW with arbitrary eccentricity. The MatBYIB employs the Analytical Kludge (AK) waveform as a computationally efficient signal generator and computes parameter uncertainties via the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For Bayesian inference, we implement the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm to derive posterior distributions. To guarantee convergence, the Gelman-Rubin convergence criterion (the Potential Scale Reduction Factor R) is used to determine sampling adequacy, with MatBYIB dynamically increasing the sample size until R &lt; 1.05 for all parameters. Our results demonstrate strong agreement between FIM- based predictions and full MCMC sampling. This program is user-friendly and allows for estimation of gravitational wave parameters with arbitrary eccentricity on standard personal computers. Code availability:The implementation is open-source at https://github.com/GenliangLi/MatBYIB.</description>

      <title>The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation model and its reheating features in light of the recent ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model consistent with the ACT data at the $68\%$ confidence level, the number of e-folds must increase while the reheating temperature decreases. We find that the Starobinsky model requires a spectator field to achieve efficient preheating. The preheating stage and the reheating temperature must be significantly adjusted to accommodate the lower temperature. In this paper, the favored non-minimal coupling of the produced particles is approximately $10$ or slightly lower. We also present viable parameter sets that fit the preferred reheating mechanism in this model. For certain parameter choices, the daughter fields could potentially be detected in future collider experiments such as the LHC or the ILC. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism can reproduce the lower reheating temperature, but it fails when the temperature falls below $1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new solution describing a static, spherically symmetric and electrically charged black hole embedded in a charged quintessence fluid, which corresponds to an electric generalization of the Kiselev geometry. We derive the effective potential and analyze the various types of orbits followed by charged particles. A special attention is given to circular orbits and their stability. We found that for uncharged particles the periapsis shifts for bounded orbits is always prograde. However, for charged test particles the periapsis shifts can become retrograde in some cases.</description>

      <title>Gravitational perturbations of the Hayward spacetime and testing the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of the Hayward black hole, a regular geometry that also arises as an effective solution in asymptotically safe gravity. By computing grey-body factors with the 6th-order WKB method and comparing them to predictions based on the quasinormal modes, the correspondence between transmission coefficients and quasinormal spectra is verified. Quantum corrections, parametrized by $\gamma$, are shown to suppress both the grey-body factors and the absorption cross-section, while the correspondence remains accurate at the percent level for low multipoles and essentially exact for higher ones.</description>

      <title>The shadows and photon rings of two minimal deformations of Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates the optical characteristics of two minimal Schwarzschild black hole deformations, the Kazakov-Solodukhin and Ghosh-Kumar black holes, under different accretion models. The event horizon, photon sphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the Schwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter ranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum correction of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole shadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of magnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated intensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the spherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and the contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition, the photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are narrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider. Whereas the Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits higher brightness, the Ghosh-Kumar black hole shows lower brightness. Additionally, a disk closer to the black hole correlates with a smaller shadow radius. This paper proposes a method to distinguish different black holes in a specific thin disk model.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact, purely geometric account of the interior dynamics of Schwarzschild black holes, formulated without invoking any specific gravitational theory and free of additional charges beyond the total mass ${\cal M}$. We show that dynamical evolution generically produces new singularities, absent in the static case, whose resolution imposes highly restrictive conditions on gravitational collapse.</description>

Abstract: Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves. Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy scenarios are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, and BA parameterizations, along with non-flat cosmologies allowing for spatial curvature ($\Omega_k \neq 0$). Our analysis supports a flat Universe with $\Omega_k \approx 0$. Using MCMC techniques, we constrain these models with observational data from DESI~DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, Type~Ia supernovae, and compressed CMB likelihoods. The results provide strong statistical evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, favoring dynamical dark-energy behavior consistent with a Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, using CMB + DESI~DR2 data: $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\omega$CDM. In the non-flat extensions, o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM, the limits relax to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. For the other models $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE the constraints range between $&lt;0.043$ and $&lt;0.127~\mathrm{eV}$. The effective number of relativistic species remains consistent with the standard value, $N_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3.044$, across all models. Bayesian evidence further shows that combining DES-SN5Y or Union3 supernova samples with CMB + DESI~DR2 produces measurable deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Although no model reaches the $5\sigma$ significance threshold, several exhibit tensions exceeding $3\sigma$, suggesting emerging cracks in the cosmological constant paradigm.</description>

      <title>On the Viability of Weak Energy Condition Violation in Parity-Violating Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of violating the weak energy condition (WEC) within a conservative effective field theory (EFT) framework by modifying only the electromagnetic sector. We add the lowest-dimension parity-violating operator, proportional to \((F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta})(F_{\gamma\delta}\tilde F^{\gamma\delta})\), suppressed by a scale \(\Lambda\). We derive the modified Einstein and Maxwell equations and show that the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor is multiplied by a factor \(\Omega=1+\zeta\mathcal P\), where \(\mathcal P\propto\vec E\cdot\vec B\). This allows for WEC violation if \(\Omega&lt;0\), which depends on the relative orientation of the electric and magnetic fields. The same operator induces vacuum birefringence, which we use to constrain the model. By comparing with laboratory (PVLAS) and astrophysical (magnetar X-ray polarimetry) data, we place a strong bound on the new physics scale, \(\Lambda\gtrsim100\) TeV. This constraint implies that the threshold for WEC violation requires field strengths far exceeding any plausible physical values and lying beyond the EFT's domain of validity. We conclude that within this simple extension of electrodynamics, negative effective energy densities are mathematically possible but physically unreachable. We also construct an exact flat-space solution at the \(\Omega=0\) threshold.</description>

      <title>Importance of being nonminimally coupled: Scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Asymptotic Safety: A Review of Solutions and Phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.</description>

      <title>Entropy of de Sitter (d+1)-spacetime: modification of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of cosmological horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24502v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the connection between the entropy of the Hubble volume in de Sitter spacetime and the Gibbons-Hawking entropy $S_{\rm GH}=A/4G$ associated with the cosmological horizon. In (3+1) spacetime, these two entropies coincide, and hence the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture holds. This provides physical meaning and a natural explanation to the Gibbons-Hawking entropy -- it is the entropy in the volume $V_H$ bounded by the cosmological horizon. Here we consider whether the Gibbons-Hawking conjecture remains valid for the de Sitter state in general $d+1$ spacetime. To do this, we use local de Sitter thermodynamics, characterized by a local temperature $T=H/\pi$. This temperature is not related to the horizon: it is the temperature of local activation processes, such as the ionization of an atom in the de Sitter environment, which occur deep within the cosmological horizon. This local temperature is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm GH}=H/2\pi$. Two different ways of calculations of the entropy of the Hubble volume were considered: integration of the local entropy density over the Hubble volume and the first law of the de Sitter thermodynamics. In both cases we found that the entropy of the Hubble volume is $S_H=(d-1)A/8G$, which modifies the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of horizon. The original form of the Gibbons-Hawking is valid only for $d=3$.</description>

Abstract: At linear order we study perturbations to a G\"odel background spacetime which includes expansion in addition to rotation. We investigate the transformation behaviour of these perturbations under gauge transformations and construct gauge invariant quantities. Using the perturbed energy conservation equation we find that there are conserved quantities in Expanding G\"odel (EG) Cosmology, in particular a spatial metric trace perturbation, {\zeta} SMTP , which is conserved on large scales for pressureless dust. We finally extend our discussion to a perfect fluid matter content to also obtain conserved quantities in this context.</description>

      <title>Observational properties and quasinormal Modes of the Hayward black Hole surrounded by a cloud of strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explored the Hayward black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings, with a focus on the effects of the regularization parameter $l$ and the string cloud parameter $a$ on its observational properties and quasinormal modes (QNMs). Utilizing the spacetime metric and geodesic equations, we calculated several geometric quantities characterizing the black hole. To visualize the observational appearance of the accretion disk, we employed the Novikov--Thorne model to simulate both its primary and secondary images. Furthermore, we analyzed the QNMs of the black hole under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations for different parameter values. The results indicate that as the regularization parameter $l$ increases, the outer horizon radius $r_{+}$, photon-sphere radius $r_{\text{ph}}$, critical impact parameter $b_{c}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\text{isco}}$ exhibit a gradual decrease, while the inner horizon radius $r_{-}$ and the real part of the QNMs frequency $\omega_{r}$ increase. In contrast, as the string cloud parameter $a$ increases, $r_{+}$, $r_{\text{ph}}$, $b_{c}$, and $r_{\text{ isco}}$ demonstrate a rapid increase, whereas $r_{-}$ and $\omega_{r}$ decrease. In both cases, the absolute value of the imaginary part of the QNMs frequency decreases with the increase $l$ or $a$. This work offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the coupling between regular black holes and surrounding string clouds.</description>

We revisit oscillatons with an exponential self-interaction and develop a full Fourier (Jacobi{Anger) treatment that resums the time dependence of both the metric and the potential, thereby unifying quadratic, quartic, and higher-order interactions within a single framework. After fixing the small-amplitude normalization V0 = m2 {\Phi}=({\lambda}2k0), we derive a closed, dimensionless boundary-value problem for the radial profiles and solve it numerically via Bessel-series truncation with controlled convergence. We compute time-resolved and time-averaged observables energy density, radial energy flux, radial/tangential pressures, and total mass and map their dependence on the coupling {\lambda} and central amplitude. The geometry exhibits only even harmonics of the fundamental frequency, while composite observables inherit a DC part plus even harmonics; the radial flux oscillates predominantly at 2!. Apparent negative instantaneous pressures arise from coherent oscillations and are assessed consistently through classical energy-condition diagnostics (WEC/NEC/SEC). Our formulation provides a reproducible and extensible baseline for stability analyses and observational constraints on SFDM oscillatons</description>

      <title>Imaging and polarization patterns of various thick disks around Kerr-MOG black holes</title>

Abstract: We investigate the imaging and polarization properties of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows. The MOG parameter $\alpha$ introduces deviations from the Kerr metric, providing a means to test modified gravity in the strong field regime. Two representative accretion models are considered: the phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and the analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF). Using general relativistic radiative transfer, we compute synchrotron emission and polarization maps under different spins, MOG parameters, inclinations, and observing frequencies. In both models, the photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing $\alpha$, whereas frame dragging produces pronounced brightness asymmetry. The BAAF model predicts a narrower bright ring and distinct polarization morphology near the event horizon. By introducing the net polarization angle $\chi_{\text{net}}$ and the second Fourier mode $\angle\beta_2$, we quantify inclination- and frame-dragging-induced polarization features. Our results reveal that both $\alpha$ and spin significantly influence the near-horizon polarization patterns, suggesting that high-resolution polarimetric imaging could serve as a promising probe of modified gravity in the strong field regime.</description>

      <title>A new regularization scheme for the wave function of the Universe in the Lorentzian path integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lorentzian path integral for the wave function of the Universe is only conditionally convergent and thus requires a well-defined prescription. The Picard-Lefschetz approach ensures convergence through contour deformation, but it has been argued that this leads to unsuppressed perturbations due to relevant saddle points residing in the region ${\rm Im}N&gt;0$. As an alternative, we propose a simple regulator for the lapse integral in minisuperspace. Specifically, we impose the vanishing initial size of the Universe via a delta function, represented as a narrow Gaussian of width $\sigma$, and take the limit $\sigma \to 0$ only after performing the functional integrations. This regulator has a clear physical interpretation: it corresponds to a vanishingly small quantum uncertainty in the initial size of the Universe. For any fixed $\sigma &gt; 0$, the lapse integral is absolutely convergent along (or slightly below) the real axis, and no excursion into the region ${\rm Im}N&gt;0$ is required. We further argue that the initial wave function for scalar and tensor perturbations should be incorporated in the Lorentzian path integral formalism, and we show that these perturbations are then appropriately suppressed. A purely Lorentzian path integral thus yields the tunneling wave function with suppressed perturbations. We also demonstrate that the Hartle-Hawking wave function can be reproduced by choosing a contour for the lapse integral extending from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$ that passes below the singularity near the origin.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Ghost Lagrange Densities for the Coupling of Gravity to Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and present symmetric ghost Lagrange densities for the coupling of General Relativity to Yang--Mills theories. The graviton-ghost is constructed with respect to the linearized de Donder gauge fixing condition and the gauge ghost with respect to the covariant Lorenz gauge fixing condition. Both ghost Lagrange densities together with their accompanying gauge fixing Lagrange densities are obtained from the action of the diffeomorphism and gauge super-BRST differential -- which we define as the composition of the BRST differential with its anti-BRST differential -- on suitable gauge fixing bosons. In addition, we introduce a total gauge fixing boson and show that the complete symmetric ghost and gauge fixing Lagrange density can be generated thereof using the total super-BRST differential. In particular, we generalize two earlier approaches for flat-spacetime Yang--Mills theories to General Relativity and covariant Yang--Mills theories: The original approach by Curci and Ferrari (1976), using the Faddeev--Popov method on non-linear gauge fixings, and the modern approach by Baulieu and Thierry-Mieg (1982), using BRST and anti-BRST symmetries with gauge fixing bosons.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

      <title>Higher-Derivate Corrections via the Double Copy Procedure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the off-shell formulation of the Double Copy (DC) procedure have revealed a profound connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant frameworks. The main example is Double Field Theory (DFT), emerging as the the off-shell DC of Yang-Mills theory up to cubic order in perturbations. Extending this procedure to a higher-derivative gauge theory gives rise to a Higher-Derivative Double Theory (HDDT), which incorporates Weyl gravity along with $b$-field and dilaton contributions, all in a T-duality invariant manner. In this work, we show that the quadratic contributions of HDDT are directly related (up to field redefinitions) to DFT+, a T-duality invariant model associated with the bosonic string that incorporates first-order $\alpha'$ corrections upon parameterization. Our results expand the potential applications of the off-shell DC program towards constructing perturbative $\alpha'$-corrected Lagrangians, while also opening up possibilities for reversing the map by considering the single and zeroth copies.</description>

Abstract: Our present contribution sets out to investigate a scenario based on the effects of the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) on the electromagnetic sector of the Standard Model of Fundamental Interactions and Particle Physics (SM). Starting then from a post-Maxwellian version of Electromagnetism that includes LQG effects, we work out and discuss the influence of LQG parameters on classical quantities, such as the components of the stress-tensor. Furthermore, we inspect the propagation of electromagnetic waves and study optical properties of the QED vacuum in this scenario. Among these, we contemplate the combined effect between the LQG parameters and a homogeneous background magnetic field on the propagation of electromagnetic waves, considering in detail issues like group velocities and refractive indices of the QED vacuum. Finally, with the help of the LQG-extended photonic dispersion relations previously analyzed, we re-discuss the kinematics of the Compton effect and conclude that there emerges an interesting nonlinear profile in the wavelengths of both the incoming and the deflected photons.</description>

      <title>Complementary signatures of $\alpha-$attractor inflation in CMB and cosmic string Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When cosmic strings are formed during inflation, they regrow to reach a scaling regime, leaving distinct imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Such signatures, associated with specific primordial features, can be detected by upcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as the LISA and Einstein Telescope (ET). Our analysis explores scenarios in which cosmic strings form either before or during inflation. We examine how the number of e-folds experienced by cosmic strings during inflation correlates with the predictions of inflationary models observable in cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements. This correlation provides a testable link between inflationary physics and the associated gravitational wave signals in a complementary manner. Focusing on $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation, with the Polynomial $\alpha$-attractor serving as an illustrative example, we find constraints, for instance, on the spectral index $n_s$ to $0.962 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.972$ for polynomial exponent $n=1$, $0.956 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.968$ for $n=2$, $0.954 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.965$ for $n=3$, and $0.963 \lesssim n_s \lesssim 0.964$ for $n=4$, which along with the GW signals from LISA, are capable of detecting local cosmic strings that have experienced $\sim 34 - 47$ e-folds of inflation consistent with current Planck data and are also testable in upcoming CMB experiments such as LiteBIRD and CMB-S4.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity quantifies the difficulty of preparing a state or implementing a unitary transformation with limited resources. Applications range from quantum computation to condensed matter physics and quantum gravity. We seek to bridge the approaches of these fields, which define and study complexity using different frameworks and tools. We describe several definitions of complexity, along with their key properties. In quantum information theory, we focus on complexity growth in random quantum circuits. In quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT), we discuss a geometric definition of complexity in terms of geodesics on the unitary group. In dynamical systems, we explore a definition of complexity in terms of state or operator spreading, as well as concepts from tensor-networks. We also outline applications to simple quantum systems, quantum many-body models, and QFTs including conformal field theories (CFTs). Finally, we explain the proposed relationship between complexity and gravitational observables within the holographic anti-de Sitter (AdS)/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like general relativity, metric-affine gravity should be a viable effective quantum theory, otherwise it is a mathematical curiosity without physical application. Assuming a perturbative quantum field theory, the universal, flat limit of metric-affine gravity offers a good foundation for model-building only when symmetry constraints are themselves sufficient to get rid of ghosts and tachyons in the spectrum of propagating particle states, without requiring any further tuning of the couplings. Using this symmetry-first criterion, we find that for parity-preserving models with a totally symmetric distortion, only massless spin-one and spin-three modes are possible besides the graviton. Moreover, no viable models result from gauge symmetries generated by a scalar field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of quantum coherence and quantum correlations in a two-particle system with deformed symmetries arising from the quantum nature of spacetime. We demonstrate that the deformation of energy-momentum composition induces a momentum-dependent interaction that counteracts the decoherence effects described by the Lindblad equation in quantum spacetime. This interplay leads to the formation of coherence, entanglement and other correlations, which we quantify using concurrence, the $l_1$-norm of coherence, quantum mutual information and Local Quantum Fisher Information. Our analysis reveals that while the openness of quantum spacetime ultimately degrades entanglement, it also facilitates the creation and preservation of both classical and quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ''final-parsec problem''. Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>The fate of Quasi-Exponential inflation in the light of ACT-DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have revisited quasi-exponential model of inflation in the light of recent ACT-DR6 and Planck data along with latest constraint on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves. For our analysis we have followed Mukhanov approach for inflationary equation-of-state employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that the model is capable of mimicking latest Planck results by providing excellent fit to scalar spectral index and its running. Not only that, amount of primordial gravitational waves is also within the present observational bound, $r&lt;0.032$. In addition to that, when the combination of ACT-DR6 and Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 data is taken into account inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model are in excellent agreement. The model also yields sublime fit to the result of joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck joint with BICEP/Keck 2018 and DESI-Y1 data. The futuristic CMB missions LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 are promising to detect primordial gravitational waves if $r\geq0.003$. We have also forecasted inflationary predictions from quasi-exponential model of inflation assuming the sensitivities of LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 along with combination of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4. We found that in each case quasi-exponential inflation may render excellent fit provided $r\geq10^{-2}$. However, non-detection of primordial gravitational waves by LiteBIRD, Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 will potentially rule out quasi-exponential model.</description>

      <title>2D End-to-End Modeling of Kilonovae from Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kilonova emission resulting from outflows produced in a three-dimensional (3D) general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnant. We map the outflows into the FLASH hydrodynamics code to model their expansion in axisymmetry, and study the effects of employing different $r$-process heating rates. Except for the highest heating rate prescription, we find no significant differences with respect to overall ejecta dynamics and morphology compared to the simulation without heating. Once homologous expansion is attained, typically after $\sim$ 2s for these ejecta, we map the outflows to the Sedona radiative transfer code and compute the spectral evolution of the kilonova and broadband light curves in various Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) bands. The kilonova properties depend on the remnant lifetime, with peak luminosities and peak timescales increasing for longer-lived remnants that produce more massive ejecta. For all models, there is a strong dependence of both the bolometric and broadband light curves on the viewing angle. While the short-lived (12ms) remnant produces higher luminosities when viewed from angles closer to the pole, longer-lived remnants (240ms and 2.5s) are more luminous when viewed from angles closer to the equator. Our results highlight the importance of self-consistent, long-term modeling of merger ejecta, and taking viewing-angle dependence into account when interpreting observed kilonova light curves. We find that magnetized outflows from a HMNS -- if it survives long enough -- could explain blue kilonovae, such as the blue emission seen in AT2017gfo.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Scientific Computing through LLM-Guided Evolutionary Search: A Case Study in Gravitational-Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated algorithm discovery in scientific computing faces fundamental challenges: vast design spaces with expensive evaluations, domain-specific physical constraints requiring expert knowledge, and the necessity for interpretable solutions that scientists can validate and understand. We present the Evo-MCTS (Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search) framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with tree-structured evolutionary search for interpretable algorithm discovery. Evo-MCTS combines reflective code synthesis leveraging LLM domain knowledge, multi-scale evolutionary operations on structured code representations, and interpretable algorithmic pathways emerging from tree-guided exploration. When applied to gravitational wave detection-a challenging domain with continuous parameter spaces and strict physical constraints-Evo-MCTS achieves 20.2% improvement over domain-specific methods and 59.1% over LLM-based optimization frameworks. This improvement arises from its ability to consistently converge toward interpretable algorithmic structures that integrate multiple functional components. Our domain-agnostic architecture establishes a generalizable methodology for automated algorithm discovery in scientific computing, where algorithmic transparency and physical validity are as essential as performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Wormholes and Gravitational States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Euclidean wormholes are known to encode important non-perturbative effects in the physics of quantum black holes. In this paper, we discuss the slicing of Euclidean wormholes along a time-reflection symmetric slice which treats half of the Euclidean geometry as a gravitational machinery to produce a semi-classical state. This type of state preparation is different from Hartle-Hawking states prepared with the CFT path integral, such as the thermofield-double state. Nevertheless, the two different types of states have order one overlaps provided the gravitational data agrees on the initial data slice. This raises an interesting puzzle: one can easily construct an infinite family of semi-classical states that have order one overlap with the thermofield double state, while having a very different Euclidean preparation. We provide a microscopic description of wormhole states in the dual CFT and reformulate the factorization puzzle in the language of entanglement and the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity in 3D: Thermodynamics of cosmological solutions and black holes with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct generalized sets of asymptotic conditions for both three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity and a novel extension that incorporates torsion through a deformation of the Maxwell algebra. These boundary conditions include the most general temporal components of the gauge fields that consistently preserve the corresponding asymptotic Maxwell algebras with identical classical central charges, while allowing for the inclusion of chemical potentials conjugate to the conserved charges. We show that both sets of asymptotic configurations admit nontrivial solutions carrying not only mass and angular momentum but also an additional global spin-2 charge. In the torsionless case, the theory admits locally flat cosmological spacetimes, whereas in the presence of torsion, it generalizes to BTZ-like black hole geometries. For each case, the thermodynamic properties are consistently derived in terms of the gauge fields and the topology of the Euclidean manifold, shown to correspond to a solid torus. Furthermore, we obtain a general expression for the entropy, depending on both the horizon area and its spin-2 analogues, which can be written as a reparametrization-invariant integral of the induced spin-2 fields on the spacelike section of the horizon.</description>

      <title>Quantum Complexity of Nonlocal Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy for nonlocal field theories displays a universal ``volume law" scaling \cite{Barbon:2008ut, Karczmarek:2013xxa, Shiba:2013jja, Pang:2014tpa} as opposed to the ``area law" scaling for local field theories. The aim of this work is to determine whether complexity displays any such an universal scaling laws. The field theories considered here are obtained by deforming $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory by higher dimension operators introducing nonlocality, namely a dipole deformation and noncommutativity (NCSYM) by turning on world volume Kalb-Ramond $B$ field. The dual gravity backgrounds have a running dilaton, in addition to the $B$-field background, which alter AdS asymptotics. Our results capture nonlocality in the hyperscaling behavior for complexity. We also compute the subregion complexity which display phase transitions in the nonlocal field theories with the transition point being the same as that for the phase transition of entanglement entropy \cite{Karczmarek:2013xxa}. These new results dovetail nicely with our findings from our previous works \cite{Chakraborty:2020fpt, Katoch:2022hdf, Bhattacharyya:2022ren} on other lower dimensional nonlocal field theories such as little string theories (LSTs) and warped conformal field theories (WCFTs).</description>

      <title>Monodromy-Matrix Description of Doubly Rotating Black Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the single-angular-momentum case analyzed in our previous work, we investigate the solution-generating technique based on the Breitenlohner-Maison (BM) linear system for asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric black hole solutions with two angular momenta in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. In particular, we construct the monodromy matrix associated with the BM linear system for the doubly rotating Myers-Perry black holes and the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black rings. Conversely, by solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem using the procedure developed by Katsimpouri et al., we demonstrate that the factorization of the monodromy matrix precisely reproduces these vacuum solutions, thereby reconstructing both geometries.</description>

      <title>A New Derivation of Classical Gravitational Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is established that black holes have entropy and behave as thermodynamical systems. Associating entropy to gravitational fields has not remained limited to black holes, necessitating the notion of the second law of thermodynamics in gravitating systems. There have been many ideas and attempts to prove the second law in gravitational systems starting from first principles. Within the covariant phase space formalism, we define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with the local boosts, detaching the gravitational entropy from horizons or trapped surfaces. Our definition encompasses and generalizes the existing notions of entropy. Using this definition for the Einstein gravity case, we compute variations of the entropy along the path of any causal observer and establish that the entropy variations are always non-negative if the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition integrated along any segment of the causal path.</description>

      <title>Quantum Symmetry and Geometry in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the quantum $R$-matrix in the double-scaled SYK model points to an underlying quantum group structure. In this work, we identify the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ as a subalgebra of the chord algebra. Specifically, we construct the generators of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ from combinations of operators within the chord algebra and show that the one-particle chord Hilbert space decomposes into the positive discrete series representations of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$. Using the coproduct structure of the quantum group, we build the multi-particle Hilbert space and establish its equivalence with previous results defined by the chord rules. In particular, we show that the quantum $R$-matrix acts as a swapping operator that reverses the ordering of open chords in each fusion channel while incorporating the corresponding $q$-weighted penalty factors. This action enables an explicit derivation of the chord Yang-Baxter relation. We further explore a realization of the quantum group generators on the quantum disk, and present a novel factorization formula for the bulk gravitational wavefunction in the presence of matter. We further discuss the relation between the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{u}(1,1))$ structure uncovered here and the $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{s} \mathfrak{l}(2, \mathbb{R}))$ algebra previously studied from the boundary perspective. Finally, we study the gravitational wavefunction with matter in the Schwarzian regime.</description>
