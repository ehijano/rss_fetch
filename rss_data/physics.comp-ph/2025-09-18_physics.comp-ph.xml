      <title>A comparative analysis of the effect of bobbin topography in the transmission performance capability of Hybrid corrugated plane type transmission surface for MR Clutches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid based devices work on the principle of changing the rheological properties of MR fluid (MRF) using magnetic field excitation generated from an electromagnet. The electromagnet is usually created with the aid of copper coils wound on a low magnetic permeable spindle structure referred to as bobbin. In this paper, an attempt has been made to investigate the different bobbin configurations and its effect on the torque transmissibility of a MR clutch (MRC). A hybrid corrugated-plane type transmission surface MRC is chosen for the study, due to the advantage of enhanced transmission capability due to the simultaneous existence of plane and corrugated extensions on the disc surface. This enhanced transmission capability, resulting from the hybrid corrugated plane type transmission surface facilitates mama,. BB vg BBC gg of the influence of bobbin configuration on the torque transmission capability in an MRC. A comparative analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software is carried out between five different innovative bobbin configurations such as rectangular, semi-circular, conical, I-sectioned and H-sectioned. This study aims to simulate and reason the variations in the magnetic field line characteristics upon variations in bobbin topography. The results obtained testify for the need of a bobbin design taking into account the transmission surface geometry. For the specific design analyzed, it was found that the H-sectioned bobbin provided the maximum torque transmission capability when compared with other topographies, whereas the conical shaped bobbin topography proved to be least facilitating for torque transmission.</description>

      <title>A reduced-order derivative-informed neural operator for subsurface fluid-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as cost-effective surrogates for expensive fluid-flow simulators, particularly in computationally intensive tasks such as permeability inversion from time-lapse seismic data, and uncertainty quantification. In these applications, the fidelity of the surrogate's gradients with respect to system parameters is crucial, as the accuracy of downstream tasks, such as optimization and Bayesian inference, relies directly on the quality of the derivative information. Recent advances in physics-informed methods have leveraged derivative information to improve surrogate accuracy. However, incorporating explicit Jacobians can become computationally prohibitive, as the complexity typically scales quadratically with the number of input parameters. To address this limitation, we propose DeFINO (Derivative-based Fisher-score Informed Neural Operator), a reduced-order, derivative-informed training framework. DeFINO integrates Fourier neural operators (FNOs) with a novel derivative-based training strategy guided by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). By projecting Jacobians onto dominant eigen-directions identified by the FIM, DeFINO captures critical sensitivity information directly informed by observational data, significantly reducing computational expense. We validate DeFINO through synthetic experiments in the context of subsurface multi-phase fluid-flow, demonstrating improvements in gradient accuracy while maintaining robust forward predictions of underlying fluid dynamics. These results highlight DeFINO's potential to offer practical, scalable solutions for inversion problems in complex real-world scenarios, all at substantially reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>A molecular rotor driven by an electric field on graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for driving a dipolar molecular rotor to rotate continuously by applying an external electric field: the dipolar rotor is fixed on a graphene sheet via a metal atom to facilitate the free rotation; it is in the meantime subjected to an electric field oriented parallel to the graphene sheet. We use computational modeling with density functional theory and Newtonian mechanics, similar to molecular dynamics simulations, to obtain the torque, angular velocity, and rotation period of the rotor. Our results show that the dipolar rotor designed here can rotate with a period of 2.96 ps by an alternating rectangular electric field with a strength of 0.5 V/{\AA}. However, a cosine wave alternating electric field depending on time cannot drive the dipolar rotor to rotate regularly. Therefore, a cosine wave electric field depending on the rotation angle is suggested, as it can not only drive the rotor but also produce additional power. Machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) simulations further confirm that the rotor remains thermodynamically stable under an electric field. This work reveals the rotation mechanism of a dipolar molecular rotor in a transverse electric field, and we hope this work can open a new path for designing more diverse molecular machines in experiments.</description>

      <title>From Data to Alloys Predicting and Screening High Entropy Alloys for High Hardness Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing need for structural materials with strength, mechanical stability, and durability in extreme environments is driving the development of high entropy alloys. These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or more principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to improvements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus, high-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace, biomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast compositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are both time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources. Machine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high entropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy combinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning framework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors such as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine learning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Transformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a language model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental descriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in predicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in this study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9 million virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning models were used to predict their hardness. This study shows how machine learning-driven high throughput screening and language modelling approaches can accelerate the development of next generation high entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Valley-Selective Linear Dichroism and Excitonic Effects in Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to encode, store, and read valley/spin information.</description>

      <title>Axial Hall Effect in Altermagnetic Lieb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom. Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Ion-modulated structure, proton transfer, and capacitance in the Pt(111)/water electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric double layer (EDL) governs electrocatalysis, energy conversion, and storage, yet its atomic structure, capacitance, and reactivity remain elusive. Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework that incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of metal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with near-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and Pt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure of the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water dissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential capacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving interfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton transfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero charge. These results show that ion-specific interactions, which are ignored in mean-field models, are central to capacitance and reactivity, providing a molecular basis for interpreting experiments and designing electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Limits of MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$: Revisiting High-Order Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Driven Peptide Classification in Biological Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A device capable of performing real time classification of proteins in a clinical setting would allow for inexpensive and rapid disease diagnosis. One such candidate for this technology are nanopore devices. These devices work by measuring a current signal that arises when a protein or peptide enters a nanometer-length-scale pore. Should this current be uniquely related to the structure of the peptide and its interactions with the pore, the signals can be used to perform identification. While such a method would allow for real time identification of peptides and proteins in a clinical setting, to date, the complexities of these signals limit their accuracy. In this work, we tackle the issue of classification by converting the current signals into scaleogram images via wavelet transforms, capturing amplitude, frequency, and time information in a modality well-suited to machine learning algorithms. When tested on 42 peptides, our method achieved a classification accuracy of ~$81\,\%$, setting a new state-of-the-art in the field and taking a step toward practical peptide/protein diagnostics at the point of care. In addition, we demonstrate model transfer techniques that will be critical when deploying these models into real hardware, paving the way to a new method for real-time disease diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Flow-driven hysteresis in the transition boiling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition boiling is an intermediate regime occurring between nucleate boiling, where bubbles at the surface efficiently carry heat away, and film boiling, where a layer of vapor formed over the surface insulates the system reducing heat transfer. This regime is inherently unstable and typically occurs near the boiling crisis, where the system approaches the maximum heat flux. Transition boiling hysteresis remains a central open problem in phase-change heat transfer, with critical implications for industrial cooling systems and nuclear reactor safety, since entering this regime sharply reduces heat removal potentially leading to overheating or component damage. We investigate the mechanisms driving hysteresis in the transition boiling regime through large-scale three-dimensional numerical simulations, providing clearcut evidence that hysteresis occurs even under idealized conditions of pool boiling on flat surfaces at constant temperature. This demonstrates that hysteresis arises purely from the flow dynamics of the liquid-vapor system, rather than from surface properties or defects. Moreover, we disclose strong asymmetries in the transition dynamics between nucleate and film boiling. During heating, the transition is abrupt and memory-less, whereas, upon decreasing the surface temperature, it is more complex, with the emergence of metastable coexisting states that can delay the transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present frozen natural orbital (FNO) based implementations of equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster (CC) with singles, doubles, and triples (SDT) for ionization potential (IP), double ionization potential (DIP), electron attachment (EA), and double electron attachment (DEA) variants. For EOM-CC with singles and doubles (SD), the FNO approach has already been studied by Krylov and co-workers for IP variant and for spin-flipping and spin-conserving excited states (respectively, the SF and EE variants) for both total energies and energy-gaps. Recently, we presented FNO-CCSDT performance for ground state energies of molecules, triplet-singlet gaps and for numerical estimation force constants of some diatomic molecules. Now we present our study on performance of IP, DIP, EA and DEA variants of FNO-EOM-CCSDT in computing total-energies, and for target-reference and target-target energy-gaps. Following earlier studies by us and by Krylov and co-workers, we also present the XFNO-EOM-CCSDT approach for these variants and examine its performance for total energies and energy-gaps.</description>

      <title>A Variational Framework for Residual-Based Adaptivity in Neural PDE Solvers and Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Residual-based adaptive strategies are widely used in scientific machine learning but remain largely heuristic. We introduce a unifying variational framework that formalizes these methods by integrating convex transformations of the residual. Different transformations correspond to distinct objective functionals: exponential weights target the minimization of uniform error, while linear weights recover the minimization of quadratic error. Within this perspective, adaptive weighting is equivalent to selecting sampling distributions that optimize the primal objective, thereby linking discretization choices directly to error metrics. This principled approach yields three benefits: (1) it enables systematic design of adaptive schemes across norms, (2) reduces discretization error through variance reduction of the loss estimator, and (3) enhances learning dynamics by improving the gradient signal-to-noise ratio. Extending the framework to operator learning, we demonstrate substantial performance gains across optimizers and architectures. Our results provide a theoretical justification of residual-based adaptivity and establish a foundation for principled discretization and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Data Denoising and Derivative Estimation for Data-Driven Modeling of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems is often hampered by measurement noise. We propose a denoising framework, called Runge-Kutta and Total Variation Based Implicit Neural Representation (RKTV-INR), that represents the state trajectory with an implicit neural representation (INR) fitted directly to noisy observations. Runge-Kutta integration and total variation are imposed as constraints to ensure that the reconstructed state is a trajectory of a dynamical system that remains close to the original data. The trained INR yields a clean, continuous trajectory and provides accurate first-order derivatives via automatic differentiation. These denoised states and derivatives are then supplied to Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to recover the governing equations. Experiments demonstrate effective noise suppression, precise derivative estimation, and reliable system identification.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of thermal transport properties across diverse materials. However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strengths and the twist angles in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.</description>

      <title>Recurrent convolutional neural networks for modeling non-adiabatic dynamics of quantum-classical systems</title>

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolution neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolution (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. We apply our RNN approach to learn the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model after an interaction quench. For shallow quenches (small changes in electron-lattice coupling), the deterministic dynamics can be accurately captured using a single-CNN-based recurrent network. In contrast, deep quenches induce chaotic evolution, making long-term trajectory prediction significantly more challenging. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the PARC-CNN architecture can effectively learn the statistical climate of the Holstein model under deep-quench conditions.</description>

      <title>Grid instability growth rates for explicit, electrostatic momentum- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms</title>

Abstract: When the Debye length is not resolved in a simulation using the most common particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm, the plasma will unphysically heat until the Debye length becomes resolved via a phenomenon known as grid heating. This article presents detailed numerical measurements of grid heating for several explicit PIC algorithms including the first systematic (covering the Debye length resolution and drift-velocity parameter space) study of grid-heating growth rates for the most-common electrostatic momentum-conserving PIC algorithm. Additionally, we derive and test a cubic-spline-based PIC algorithm that ensures that the interpolated electric field has a continuous first derivative, but find that a differentiable electric field has minimal impact on grid-heating stability. Also considered are energy-conserving PIC algorithms with linear and quadratic interpolation functions. In all cases, we find that unphysical heating can occur for some combinations of Debye under-resolution and plasma drift. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that grid heating cannot be eliminated by using a higher-order field solve, and give an analytical expression for the cold-beam stability limits of some energy-conserving algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Alpha-Particle-Immune Gate-All-Around Field-Effect Transistors (GAA-FET) Based SRAM Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, using 3D Technology Computer-Aided-Design (TCAD) simulations, we show that it is possible to design a static random-access memory (SRAM) using gate-all-around field-effect-transistor (GAA-FET) technology so that it is immune to single alpha particle radiation error. In other words, with the design, there will be no single-event upset (SEU) due to alpha particles. We first use ab initio calculations in PHITS to show that there is a maximum linear energy transfer (LET), LETmax, for the alpha particle in Si and Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$. Based on that, by designing a sub-7nm GAA-FET-based SRAM with bottom dielectric isolation (BDI), we show that the SRAM does not flip even if the particle strike is in the worst-case scenario.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic landscape of easily-exfoliable two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>
