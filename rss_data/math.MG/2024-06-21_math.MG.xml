      <title>Petty projection inequality on the sphere and on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using gnomonic projection and Poincar\'e model, we first define the spherical projection body and hyperbolic projection body in spherical space $\mathbb{S}^n$ and hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, then define the spherical Steiner symmetrization and hyperbolic Steiner symmetrization, finally prove the spherical projection inequality and hyperbolic projection inequality.</description>

      <title>Notes on the Cheeger and Colding version of the Reifenberg theorem for metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Reifenberg's theorem says that a set which is sufficiently well approximated by planes uniformly at all scales is a topological H\"older manifold. Remarkably, this generalizes to metric spaces, where the approximation by planes is replaced by the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This fact was shown by Cheeger and Colding in an appendix of one of their celebrated works on Ricci limit spaces [8]. Given the recent interest around this statement in the growing field of analysis in metric spaces, in this note we provide a self contained and detailed proof of the Cheeger and Colding result. Our presentation substantially expands the arguments in [8] and makes explicit all the relevant estimates and constructions. As a byproduct we also shows a biLipschitz version of this result which, even if folklore among experts, was not present in the literature. This work is an extract from the doctoral dissertation of the second author.</description>

      <title>A flexible polyhedron without self-intersections in Euclidean 3-space, all of whose dihedral angles change during a flex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a sphere-homeomorphic flexible self-intersection free polyhedron in Euclidean 3-space such that all its dihedral angles change during some flex of this polyhedron. The constructed polyhedron has 26 vertices, 72 edges and 48 faces. To study its properties, we use symbolic computations in the Wolfram Mathematica software system.</description>

      <title>A variational perspective on the dissipative Hamiltonian structure of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation describes the evolution of the probability density of the position and velocity of particles under the influence of external confinement, interaction, friction, and stochastic force. It is well-known that this equation can be formally seen as a dissipative Hamiltonian system in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In order to better understand this geometric formalism, we introduce a time-discrete variational scheme, solutions of which converge to the solution of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation as time-step vanishes. The implicit scheme is based on the symplectic Euler scheme, and updates the probability density at each iteration first in the velocity variable then in the position variable.
  The algorithm leverages the geometric structure of the Wasserstein space, and has several desirable properties. Energy functionals involved in each variational problem are geodesically-convex, which implies the unique solvability of the problem. Furthermore, the correct dissipation of the Hamiltonian is observed at the discrete level up to higher order errors.</description>

      <title>Can the quadratrix truly square the circle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadratrix received its name from the circle quadrature, squaring the circle, but it only solves it if completed by taking a limit, as pointed out already in antiquity. We ask if it can square the circle without limits and restrict its use accordingly, to converting ratios of angles and segments into each other. The problem is then translated into algebra by analogy to straightedge and compass constructions, and leads to an open question in transcendental number theory. In particular, Lindemann's impossibility result no longer suffices, and the answer depends on whether $\pi$ belongs to the analog of Ritt's exponential-logarithmic field with an algebraic base. We then derive that it does not from the well-known Schanuel conjecture. Thus, the quadratrix so restricted cannot square the circle after all.</description>

      <title>Weakly porous sets and $A_1$ Muckenhoupt weights in spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we characterize the sets $E\subset X$ for which there is some $\alpha&gt;0$ such that the function $d(\cdot,E)^{-\alpha}$ belongs to the Muckenhoupt class $A_1(X,d,\mu)$, where $(X,d,\mu)$ is a space of homogeneous type, extending a recent result obtained by Carlos Mudarra in metric spaces endowed with doubling measures. In particular, generalizations of the notions of weakly porous sets and doubling of the maximal hole function are given and it is shown that these concepts have a natural connection with the $A_1$ condition of some negative power of its distance function. The proof presented here is based on Whitney-type covering lemmas built on balls of a particular quasi-distance equivalent to the initial quasi-distance $d$ and provided by Roberto Mac\'ias and Carlos Segovia in "A well-behaved quasi-distance for spaces of homogeneous type", Trabajos de Matem\'atica 32, Instituto Argentino de Matem\'atica, 1981, 1-18.</description>

      <title>Ahlfors regularity of Patterson-Sullivan measures of Anosov groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For all Zarski dense Anosov subgroups of a semisimple real algebraic group, we prove that their limit sets are Ahlfors regular for intrinsic conformal premetrics. As a consequence, we obtain that a Patterson-Sullivan measure is equal to the Hausdorff measure if and only if the associated linear form is symmetric. We also discuss several applications, including analyticity of $(p,q)$-Hausdorff dimensions on the Teichm\"uller spaces, new upper bounds on the growth indicator, and $L^2$-spectral properties of associated locally symmetric manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Fourier analytic approach to exceptional set estimates for orthogonal projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marstrand's celebrated projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. It is straightforward to see that sets for which the Fourier and Hausdorff dimension coincide have no exceptional projections, that is, \emph{all} orthogonal projections satisfy the conclusion of Marstrand's theorem. With this in mind, one might believe that the Fourier dimension (or at least, Fourier decay) could be used to give better estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set in general. We obtain projection theorems and exceptional set estimates based on the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. We apply these results to show that the Fourier spectrum can be used to improve several results for the Hausdorff dimension in certain cases, such as Ren--Wang's sharp bound for the exceptional set in the plane, Peres--Schlag's exceptional set bound and Bourgain--Oberlin's sharp $0$-dimensional exceptional set estimate.</description>
