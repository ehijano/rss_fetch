      <title>Weak Hopf quasigroups and matched pairs of quasigroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of exact factorization of a quasigroupoid and the notion of matched pair of quasigroupoids with common base. We prove that if $({\sf A}, {\sf H})$ is a matched pair of quasigroupoids it is posible to construct a new quasigroupoid ${\sf A}\bowtie {\sf H}$ called the double cross product of ${\sf A}$ and ${\sf H}$. Also, we show that, if a quasigroupoid ${\sf B}$ admits an exact factorization, there exists a matched pair of quasigroupoids $({\sf A}, {\sf H})$ and an isomorphism of quasigroupoids between ${\sf A}\bowtie {\sf H}$ and ${\sf B}$. Finally, if ${\mathbb K}$ is a field, we show that every matched pair of quasigroupoids $({\sf A}, {\sf H})$ induce, thanks to the quasigroupoid magma construction, a pair $({\mathbb K}[{\sf A}], {\mathbb K}[{\sf H}])$ of weak Hopf quasigroups and a double crossed product weak Hopf quasigroup ${\mathbb K}[{\sf A}]\bowtie{\mathbb K}[{\sf H}]$ isomorphic to ${\mathbb K}[{\sf A}\bowtie {\sf H}]$ as weak Hopf quasigroups.</description>

      <title>Property $(\diamond)$ for Ore extensions of small Krull dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of a project to determine which skew polynomial algebras $S = R[\theta; \alpha]$ satisfy property $(\diamond)$, namely that the injective hull of every simple $S$-module is locally artinian, where $k$ is a field, $R$ is a commutative noetherian $k$-algebra, and $\alpha$ is a $k$-algebra automorphism of $R$. Earlier work (which we review) and further analysis done here leads us to focus on the case where $S$ is a primitive domain and $R$ has Krull dimension 1 and contains an uncountable field. Then we show first that if $|\mathrm{Spec}(R)|$ is infinite then $S$ does not satisfy $(\diamond)$. Secondly we show that when $R = k[X]_{&lt;X&gt;}$ and $\alpha (X) = qX$ where $q \in k \setminus \{0\}$ is not a root of unity then $S$ does not satisfy $(\diamond)$. This is in complete contrast to our earlier result that, when $R = k[[X]]$ and $\alpha$ is an arbitrary $k$-algebra automorphism of infinite order, $S$ satisfies $(\diamond)$. A number of open questions are stated.</description>

      <title>Differential identities of matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the differential identities of the algebra $M_k(F)$ of $k\times k$ matrices over a field $F$ of characteristic zero when its full Lie algebra of derivations, $L=\mbox{Der}(M_k(F))$, acts on it. We determine a set of 2 generators of the ideal of differential identities of $M_k(F)$ for $k\geq 2$. Moreover, we obtain the exact values of the corresponding differential codimensions and differential cocharacters. Finally we prove that, unlike the ordinary case, the variety of differential algebras with $L$-action generated by $M_k(F)$ has almost polynomial growth for all $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Residue Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider residue structures $R/G$ where $(G,+)$ is an additive subgroup of a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$, not necessarily an ideal. Special instances include Krasner's construction of quotient hyperfields, and Pumpluen's construction of nonassociative algebras. The residue construction, treated formally, satisfies the Noether isomorphism theorems, and also is cast in a broader categorical setting which includes categorical products, sums, and tensor products.</description>

      <title>A syntactic characterization of weakly Mal'tsev varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of a weakly Mal'tsev category, as it was introduced in 2008 by the third author, is a generalization of the classical notion of a Mal'tsev category. It is well-known that a variety of universal algebras is a Mal'tsev category if and only if its theory admits a Mal'tsev term. In the main theorem of this paper, we prove a syntactic characterization of the varieties that are weakly Mal'tsev categories. We apply our result to the variety of distributive lattices which was known to be a weakly Mal'tsev category before. By a result of Z. Janelidze and the third author, a finitely complete category is weakly Mal'tsev if and only if any internal strong reflexive relation is an equivalence relation. In the last part of this paper, we give a syntactic characterization of those varieties in which any regular reflexive relation is an equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>A bounded below, noncontractible, acyclic complex of projective modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct examples of bounded below, noncontractible, acyclic complexes of finitely generated projective modules over some rings $S$, as well as bounded above, noncontractible, acyclic complexes of injective modules. The rings $S$ are certain rings of infinite matrices with entries in the rings of commutative polynomials or formal power series in infinitely many variables. In the world of comodules or contramodules over coalgebras over fields, similar examples exist over the cocommutative symmetric coalgebra of an infinite-dimensional vector space. A simpler, universal example of a bounded below, noncontractible, acyclic complex of free modules with one generator, communicated to the author by Canonaco, is included at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>Waring Problem for Matrices over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for all integers $k \geq 1$, $q\ge (k-1)^4+ 6k$, and $m \geq 1$, every matrix in $ M_m(\mathbb F_q)$ is a sum of two kth powers: $M_m(\mathbb F_q)=\{A^k+B^k|A,B\in M_m(\mathbb F_q)\}$. We further generalize and refine this result in the cases when both $B$ and $C$ can be chosen to be invertible, cyclic, or split semisimple, when $k$ is coprime to $p$, or when $m$ is sufficiently large. We also give a criterion for the Waring problem in terms of stabilizers.</description>

      <title>Exponentially localised interface eigenmodes in finite chains of resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies wave localisation in chains of finitely many resonators. There is an extensive theory predicting the existence of localised modes induced by defects in infinitely periodic systems. This work extends these principles to finite-sized systems. We consider finite systems of subwavelength resonators arranged in dimers that have a geometric defect in the structure. This is a classical wave analogue of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We prove the existence of a spectral gap for defectless finite dimer structures and find a direct relationship between eigenvalues being within the spectral gap and the localisation of their associated eigenmode. Then we show the existence and uniqueness of an eigenvalue in the gap in the defect structure, proving the existence of a unique localised interface mode. To the best of our knowledge, our method, based on Chebyshev polynomials, is the first to characterise quantitatively the localised interface modes in systems of finitely many resonators.</description>
