      <title>Localization and topological signatures under periodic twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore a dynamical generalization of the Aubry-Andr\'e model in two dimensions formed by superimposing two square-lattice potentials. Motivated by the rich physics emerging at different twist angles between the two lattices at equilibrium, we introduce periodic twisting by continuously rotating one of the lattices with respect to the other in the plane. We demonstrate that the distinct time-dependent twisting in this system gives rise to an intricate form of periodic multi-frequency driving that changes with the distance from the rotation axis. We find that the incommensurate nature of the potential no longer plays the pivotal role as it does in the static case. Rather, the tunneling can be understood in terms of a local, spatially varying dynamical localization effect, which we show to yield ring-shaped states localized within the bulk that have interesting transport signatures. Quantifying the eigenstates with the Bott index and local Chern marker, we find that there is a zoo of states with non-trivial topological signatures, the most ubiquitous of which result in relatively uniform ring-shaped regions of the Chern marker. We investigate the origin of these effects from various angles and identify that hybridization between different delocalized ring states plays a vital role. Lastly, we discuss possible experimental realizations in quantum simulation settings. Our results open a new avenue of investigation with periodic twisting inducing a spatially varying multi-frequency drive.</description>

      <title>Supersolid light in a semiconductor microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolidity - simultaneous superfluid flow and crystalline order - has been realized in quantum atomic systems but remains unexplored in purely photonic platforms operating at weak light-matter coupling. We predict a supersolid phase of light in a plasma-filled optical microcavity, where photons acquire effective mass and interact via nonlocal, plasma-mediated nonlinearities. By deriving a Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a tunable photon-photon interaction kernel, we show that under coherent driving the cavity light field can spontaneously crystallize into a supersolid lattice via modulational instability. Crucially, this supersolid arises from a weak photon-electron coupling enabled by virtual electronic transitions, and it does not require hybrid polariton formation. Using doped semiconductor microcavities, we identify feasible conditions (electron densities $\sim 10^{10}- 10^{11}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ and optical intensities $\sim 10^{2}-10^{4}~\mathrm{W/cm}^{2}$) for experimental realization. This work establishes plasmonic cavities as a platform for correlated photonic matter with emergent quantum order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lasers provide intense coherent radiation, essential to cool and trap atoms into a Bose-Einstein condensate or can alternatively drive the non-linear dynamics of high-order harmonic generation. Yet, these two fundamental processes remained of independent consideration. Here, we connect matter waves at ultracold temperatures with radiation bursts on the ultrafast attosecond timescale. We do this by exploring high harmonic generation from a Bose-Einstein condensate.</description>

      <title>Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SU}(3)$ Fermi-Hubbard gas with three-body losses: symmetries and dark states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ invariant Fermi-Hubbard gas undergoing on-site three-body losses. The model presents eight independent strong symmetries preventing the complete depletion of the gas. By making use of a basis of semi-standard Young tableaux states, we reveal the presence of a rich phenomenology of stationary states. We classify the latter according to the irreducible representation of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ to which they belong. We finally discuss the presence of three-particle stationary states that are not protected by the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Tuning spin-density separation via finite-range interactions: Dimensionality-driven signatures in dynamic structure factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-density (charge) separation, marked by distinct propagation velocities of spin and density excitations, epitomizes strong correlations, historically confined to one-dimensional (1D) systems. The recent experimental work of S. Dhar, B. Wang, M. Horvath, et al. Nature 642, 53 (2025), using a weakly interacting 3D Bose-Einstein condensate of $^{133}$Cs atoms confined in a 2D optical lattice to realize spin-density separation and demonstrate boson anyonization, motivates a deeper exploration into how dimensionality and interactions govern quantum correlations. In this work, we investigate this in two-component bosonic mixtures with finite-range interactions, probing 1D and 3D dynamics. Using path integral effective field theory within the one-loop approximation, we derive analytical expressions for zero-temperature ground-state energy and quantum depletion, seamlessly recovering contact interaction results in the contact limit. By crafting an effective action for decoupled density and spin modes, we compute dynamic structure factors (DSFs), revealing how finite-range interactions sculpt spin-density separation. A pivotal finding is the dimensionality-driven divergence in DSF peak dynamics: in 1D, peaks ascend to higher frequencies with increasing interaction strength, yielding sharp responses; in 3D, peaks descend to lower frequencies, with broader density wave profiles. These insights highlight dimensionality's critical role in collective excitations and provide a robust theoretical blueprint for probing interaction-driven quantum phenomena via Bragg spectroscopy, paving new pathways for exploring dimensionally tuned quantum correlations in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Thermal relaxation and the complete set of second order transport coefficients for the unitary Fermi gas from kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the complete set of second order transport coefficients of the unitary Fermi gas, a dilute gas of spin 1/2 particles interacting via an $s$-wave interaction tuned to infinite scattering length. The calculation is based on kinetic theory and the Chapman-Enskog method at second order in the Knudsen expansion. We take into account the exact two-body collision integral. We extend previous results on second order coefficients related to shear stress by including terms related to heat flow and gradients of the fugacity. We confirm that the thermal relaxation time is given by the simple estimate $\tau_\kappa = \kappa m/(c_PT)$ even if the full collision kernel is taken into account. Here, $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity, $m$ is the mass of the particles, $c_P$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $T$ is the temperature.</description>

      <title>Zero-energy resonances in ultracold hydrogen sticking to liquid helium films of finite thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated quantum states of ultracold hydrogen atoms in a combined potential comprising the H-He film interaction in the presence of a substrate and the Earth gravitational field. We show that the shift and width of the gravitational quantum states are determined by the complex scattering length for the H-He film-substrate potential. We demonstrate that for specific helium film thicknesses above a substrate, zero-energy resonances occur if the combined potential supports a bound state exactly at the threshold. This effect leads to a complete restructuring of the bound states spectrum. The dynamics of gravitational levels as a function of the van der Waals interaction depth controlled by the helium film thickness is analyzed. It reveals the critical thicknesses at about 6.1 and 1.8 nm, at which resonances appear in the case of the conductive substrate. With imaginary integral operators, we incorporate non-perturbatively the inelastic effects originating from the ripplon coupling. The inelastic effects show dramatic changes in the sticking-coefficient behavior near the critical points. The enhanced sticking coefficients provide a probe for studying critical phenomena and measuring atom-surface interaction parameters with unprecedented sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Itinerant ferromagnetism in an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model at finite temperatures: A dynamical mean-field theory study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice at finite temperatures, combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Taking strong correlations into account carefully, we find a ferromagnetically ordered state, in which one of the three components becomes dominant, when holes are doped away from one-third filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this ferromagnetically ordered phase undergoes a first-order transition to a paramagnetic state. We clarify the stability of the ferromagnetically ordered state against interaction strength, hole doping, and temperatures. The relevance of generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism is also addressed, by comparing the results on the Bethe lattice.</description>

      <title>Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment - direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.</description>
