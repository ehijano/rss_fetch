      <title>A Correlation Between Black Hole Mass and Dark Matter Halo Concentration in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a positive correlation between supermassive black hole mass and dark matter halo concentration at fixed halo mass in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Analyzing central galaxies in TNG100 (N = 18,954), EAGLE (N = 1,522), and CAMELS-TNG (N = 6,664), we find partial correlation coefficients of r = +0.24, +0.34, and +0.66 respectively, all highly significant (p &lt; 10^-10). The correlation is absent in SIMBA (r = +0.01, p = 0.09), which employs a torque-limited black hole accretion model rather than the Bondi-based prescription used by the other simulations. Both TNG and EAGLE exhibit a mass-dependent sign transition: the correlation is negative or null at log(M200/Msun) &lt; 11.5 but strongly positive at higher masses. We interpret this pattern as reflecting the coupling between Bondi accretion rates and central gas density structure: halos with higher concentration have denser cores, enabling more efficient black hole growth at fixed halo mass. The absence of the correlation in torque-limited models supports this interpretation. These results suggest that halo concentration may be a fundamental parameter governing black hole-galaxy coevolution.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Formalism for Simulating Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is plausible that the dark matter particles have non-gravitational interactions among themselves. If such self interactions are large enough, they could leave an imprint on the morphology of galaxies. These effects can be studied with numerical simulations, which serve as the primary tool to predict the non-linear evolution of galactic structure. A standard assumption is that the course-grained phase-space distribution of the macroscopic simulation particles follows the same evolution equation as that of the fundamental dark matter particles. This Letter tests this assumption directly for the case of frequent dark matter scatterings, demonstrating that this is not generically true. Specifically, we develop a first-principles map from a microscopic particle physics description of self-interacting dark matter to a representation of macroscopic simulation particles for theories in the short-mean-free-path regime. Using this procedure, we show the emergence of an effective force between the simulation particles and derive their interaction cross section, which depends on the one from fundamental particle physics. This work provides the first explicit map from particle physics to simulation, which will facilitate exploring the phenomenological implications for galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Widespread Shocks in an Odd Radio Circle Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of extragalactic object, with large rings of faint radio continuum emission typically spanning 100s of kpc; their origins are unknown. Previous optical spectroscopy of the central galaxy in ORC4, a classic isolated ORC, revealed spatially-extended ionized gas with strong [OII] emission and line ratios consistent with LINER emission. We present new Keck/KCWI+KCRM integral field spectroscopy covering multiple strong optical emission lines to measure the extent, morphology, and spatially-resolved kinematics and line ratios of the ionized and neutral gas in the ORC4 central galaxy. We find that [OII] is the strongest optical emission line in this massive, old galaxy, and the [OII] emission is more spatially extended than other optical lines, including H-alpha. The gas kinematics show strong spatial asymmetries, high velocity gradients (&gt;100 km/s), and high velocity dispersion (~200 km/s). The emission line ratios are most consistent with shock models with shock velocities of ~200-300 km/s and are not fit well by AGN photoionization models. These findings strongly suggest that the gas in the ORC4 central galaxy is the result of shock ionization in and around the central galaxy, likely associated with the event that created the large-scale radio ring of emission that identified this source as an ORC.</description>

      <title>Precision Spectroscopy for 1.9 Million Galaxies from SDSS-IV: Improved Spectral Measurements and Catalogs for eBOSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV DR17 Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) consists of 2,233,939 high-quality optical galaxy spectra obtained through 2" fibers, providing a rich spectroscopic resource for studying galaxy evolution across a broad redshift range. eBOSS was designed primarily for large-scale structure and BAO measurements and, as such, focused on galaxy redshifts, leaving much of the information contained in the spectra unexplored. In addition to the trove of spectra, the large number of repeat observations (197,521 duplicate spectra) enables evaluation of the survey's spectrophotometric quality. To unlock this potential, we introduce the eBOSS Data Analysis Pipeline (eBOSS-DAP), adapted from the MaNGA-DAP, which delivers uniform measurements of emission-line fluxes and equivalent widths, stellar and gas kinematics, continuum spectral indices, and stellar population fits. Using the eBOSS-DAP, we successfully analyze 1,899,553 high-quality galaxy spectra below a redshift of $z &lt; 1.12$ to produce an extensive spectroscopic catalog for the eBOSS galaxy sample. We characterize the calibration performance, quantify the reliability of the derived measurements, and release a suite of data products that fully exploit the power of the eBOSS dataset. These catalogs open the door to a new generation of studies in galaxy evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Luminosity-dependent Continuum Lag in NGC 4151 from Photometric and Spectroscopic Continuum Reverberation Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powers active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and drives feedback that shapes galaxy evolution. Constraining AGN accretion disk structure is therefore essential for understanding black hole growth and feedback processes. However, direct constraints on disk size remain rare -- particularly from long-term, multi-season spectroscopic reverberation mapping (RM), which is critical for isolating the intrinsic disk response from the broad-line region (BLR). We present results from an intensive multi-wavelength RM campaign of NGC 4151 during its brightest state in nearly two decades. This represents the third high-cadence monitoring over the past decade, capturing accretion states spanning the transitional regime between thin and thick disks, making NGC 4151 the only AGN with continuum RM observations across such a wide range in accretion states. Combining spectroscopy from the Lijiang 2.4 m telescope with coordinated Swift UV/X-ray monitoring, we measure inter-band continuum lags from UV to optical. The wavelength-dependent lags follow a tight $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$ relation, consistent with reprocessing in a thin disk, but exceed theoretical predictions by a factor of 6.6. Our lag spectrum reveals clear excesses near the Balmer and possibly Paschen jumps, confirming diffuse continuum (DC) contamination from the BLR. By comparing the three campaigns, we discover a non-monotonic lag-luminosity trend ($&gt;3\sigma$), which cannot be explained by DC emission alone. We propose the lags reflect combined disk and BLR contributions, and present the first evidence that the DC component follows an intrinsic Baldwin effect. These results offer new insights into SMBH mass measurements and theoretical models of AGN inner structure.</description>

      <title>Measurements of quasar proximity zones with the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of DESI Y1 quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) around quasars is shaped by their dense environments and by their excess ionizing radiation, forming a "quasar proximity zone" whose size and anisotropy depend on the quasar's halo mass, luminosity, age, and radiation geometry. Using over 10,000 quasar pairs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 data, with projected comoving separations $r_{\perp} &lt; 2\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$, we investigate how the proximity zone of foreground quasars at $z\sim2{\rm-}3.5$ affects Lyman-alpha absorption in their background quasars. The large DESI sample enables unprecedented precision in measuring this "transverse proximity" effect, allowing a detailed investigation of the signal's dependence on the projected separation of quasar pairs and the luminosity of the foreground quasar. We find that enhanced gas clustering near quasars dominates over their ionizing effect, leading to stronger absorption on neighboring sightlines. Under the assumption that quasar ionizing luminosity is isotropic and steady, we infer the IGM overdensity profile in the vicinity of quasars, finding overdensities as high as $\Delta \sim 10$ at comoving distance $\sim 1\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ from the most luminous systems. Surprisingly, however, we find no significant dependence of the proximity profile on the luminosity of the foreground quasar. This lack of luminosity dependence could reflect a cancellation between higher ionizing flux and higher gas overdensity, or it could indicate that quasar emission is highly time variable or anisotropic, so that the observed luminosity does not trace the ionizing flux on nearby sightlines.</description>

      <title>The evolution of obscured AGN across cosmic time -- A large quasar survey for the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a large quasar demographic optical multi-object spectroscopic (MOS) survey targeting over 50 million AGN candidates up to the highest redshifts possible in the optical (z~6.5), with repeat visits, using a variety of selection criteria available by 2040. A large MOS survey combining all AGN selection methods is the only way to unify a diverse range of different obscured AGN populations within a single, variability- and spectroscopy-based framework, rather than as disjoint classes selected by different methods.</description>

      <title>The Extended Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for MaNGA Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.</description>

      <title>Linear Analyses of Thermal Instability in Stratified Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18624v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal instability in the circum-galactic medium (CGM) can be responsible for the existence of cold clouds (e.g., high-velocity clouds) embedded in a hot diffuse medium (e.g., X-ray emitting gas). While many previous studies have analyzed thermal instability in uniform medium, the instability mechanism in gravitationally stratified medium like CGM has not been fully analyzed. This study investigates how gravity affects the behavior of thermal instability through linear perturbation analyses.We find that in stratified medium, thermal instability can drive over-stable modes, a behavior distinctly different from the monotonic growth of thermal instability in a uniformmedium. Furthermore, we find that the combination of buoyancy and thermal instability drives other two unstable modes. Applying our results to a simplified model of the CGM, we estimate the gas accretion rate from the CGM to the Galactic disk and the typical size of high-velocity cloud driven by thermal instability to be a few solar masses per year. This gas accretion rate is comparable to the observed star formation rate, and hence, the mass in the Galactic disk can be maintained. Our results provide a theoretical framework for understanding the formation of multi-phase gas, particularly in the CGM.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Milky Way's Matter Field and Dynamical Accretion History based on AI-GS3 Hunter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GS3 Hunter (Galactic-Seismology Substructures and Streams Hunter), a novel deep-learning method that combines Siamese Neural Networks and K-means clustering to identify substructures and streams in stellar kinematic data. Applied to Gaia EDR3 and GALAH DR3, it recovers known groups (e.g., Thamnos, Helmi, GSE, Sequoia) and, with DESI dataset, reveals that GSE consists of four distinct components (GSH-GSH1 through GSE-GSH4), implying a multi-event accretion origin. Tests on LAMOST K-giants recover Sagittarius, Hercules-Aquila, and Virgo Overdensity, while also uncovering new substructures. Validation with FIRE simulations shows good agreement with previous results. GS3 Hunter thus offers a powerful tool to understand the Milky Way's halo assembly and tidal history.</description>

      <title>Towards Unveiling the Origins of the Milky Way Bulge through Multi-band-Messenger Sky Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the structure and chemo-dynamical properties of the Galactic bulge using ab-type RR Lyrae stars (RRabs) from OGLE-IV and giant stars from APOGEE and Gaia. Orbital integration of 1,879 RRab variables reveals three populations: central bulge, inner bulge, and halo/disk contaminants. Inner bulge RRabs display bar-like kinematics, whereas central bulge stars show slower rotation and lower dispersion. APOGEE data for 28,188 stars confirm these kinematic trends and reveal a bimodal chemical distribution, indicating distinct formation pathways. Our results support a pseudo-bulge origin of the inner bulge through disk instability, with the overall morphology better described as boxy rather than X-shaped. Through the integration of multi-messenger, multi-band data, our collaboration aims to provide deeper insights into the physical properties and evolutionary history of the Galactic bulge.</description>

      <title>Spider-Webb: Spatially-Resolved Evidence of Inside-Out Quenching in the Spiderweb Protocluster at $z \sim 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spatially-resolved analysis of galaxy quenching within the Spiderweb Protocluster at $z \sim 2.16$, combining deep imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Utilizing pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting, we derive maps of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and rest-frame UVJ colors. Quiescent galaxies, predominantly found at $\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.5$, exhibit clear mass-dependent inside-out quenching, with central sSFR approximately an order of magnitude lower than outer regions, while lower-mass star-forming galaxies show flat sSFR profiles. Central star formation activity fundamentally anti-correlates with S\'ersic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by $z \sim 2$, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with AGN-driven feedback processes. Our study provides key observational constraints on galaxy evolution during this critical epoch.</description>

      <title>Orbital classification in rotating bar potentials using an empirical proxy of the second integral of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for classifying two-dimensional orbits in rotating bar potentials, based on an empirical proxy for the second integral of motion, Calibrated Angular Momentum (CAM), which is defined as the ratio of the time-averaged angular momentum ($\overline{L_z}$) to its temporal dispersion ($\sigma_{L_z}$) in the corotating frame. We show that CAM is determined by the ratio of the azimuthal to radial actions (${J_\phi}^\prime / {J_r}^\prime$) in the analytical Freeman bar model. We then construct a new parameter space defined by CAM versus the root-mean-square radius ($R_{RMS}$), and apply this framework to orbits in several representative rotating bar potentials. In the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane, periodic orbits generate well-defined branches separating distinct regions corresponding to different orbital families. Several of these branches enclose isolated areas that can be associated with specific orbital families, such as the the $x_2$ orbital family. We further validate the method using orbits from test-particle simulations, which show a well-ordered and non-overlapping distribution of orbital families in the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane. Since CAM is fundamentally linked to intrinsic orbital properties and readily applied to three-dimensional orbits in N-body simulations, our results establish the CAM-$R_{RMS}$ plane as a robust and efficient framework for orbit classification in rotating bars that complements conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Validating the CROCODILE model within the AGORA galaxy simulation framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical galaxy formation simulations are sensitive to numerical methods and sub-grid physics models, making code comparison projects essential for quantifying uncertainties. Here, we evaluate GADGET4-OSAKA within the AGORA project framework by conducting a systematic comparison with its predecessor. We perform an isolated disk galaxy and a cosmological zoom-in run of a Milky Way-mass halo, following the multi-step AGORA calibration procedure. By systematically deconstructing the updated stellar feedback model, we demonstrate that mechanical momentum injection is necessary to suppress unphysical gas fragmentation and regulate star formation, yielding agreement with the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. Meanwhile, stochastic thermal heating is essential for driving a hot, metal-enriched gaseous halo, thereby creating a multiphase circumgalactic medium that is absent in the predecessor code. In the cosmological context, we calibrate the simulation to match the stellar mass growth history targeted by the AGORA collaboration. The validated GADGET4-OSAKA simulation has been contributed to the AGORA CosmoRun suite, providing a new data point for understanding the impact of numerical and physical modeling choices on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Fragmenting Filaments and Evolving Cores -- Insights from Dust Polarisation Study of a filament in Northern Orion B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of polarised dust emission at 850 micron for a parsec long filament in the northern part of the Orion B molecular cloud. The region was observed by the JCMT SCUBA-2/POL-2 polarimeter. The filament has a line mass (~80 Msun/pc) larger than the critical (magnetic) line mass (~37 Msun/pc); and hosts one starless, three prestellar, and four protostellar cores, with masses in the range 0.13 to 9.13 Msun. The mean (debiased) polarisation fraction of the filament and core pixels was calculated to be 5.3+/-0.3% and 3.2+/-0.3%, respectively, likely reflecting their distinct physical conditions. The polarisation fraction for the cores does not depend on the type of core, and was found to decrease with increasing column density, varying from 6-11% at the filament edges to 1$^{+0.7}_{-0.1}$% in the denser parts ($N_{H2}\gtrsim$2x10$^{22}$cm$^{-2}$). Magnetic field orientation of the protostellar cores, in contrast to prestellar cores, appears to be relatively aligned with the magnetic field orientation of the local filament in this region. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi formalism the plane-of-sky magnetic field strength for the protostellar cores (~39-110 microG) was found to be higher than that of the prestellar cores (~22-61 microG); and weakest for the starless core (~6 microG). The average value for the filament was found to be ~31 microG. The magnetic field-volume density relation for the prestellar/starless cores and protostellar cores suggests a transition from weak field case to strong field case as the cores evolve from prestellar to protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way Bulge Extra-Tidal Star Survey: NGC 6569</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic evidence for tidal debris associated with the bulge globular cluster NGC 6569, based on medium-resolution (R ~ 11,000) Anglo-Australian Telescope spectra of 303 stars. Targets were selected using Blanco DECam Bulge Survey (BDBS) photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, spanning 7-30 arcmin (~1-5 rt, where rt is the King-model tidal radius) from the cluster center. Orbit-based modeling predicts a strongly time-variable Jacobi radius, with rJ ~ 8-11 arcmin near pericenter and ~18-22 arcmin near apocenter, so stars just outside rt can be unbound and feeding leading and lagging tidal tails. We identify 40 stars with kinematics and abundances consistent with previous, or borderline, cluster membership. The seven highest-quality candidates (S/N &gt; 30) have mean [Fe/H] = -0.83 +/- 0.14 and [alpha/Fe] = +0.38 +/- 0.06 dex, matching the bound population. Interpreting these stars as recently stripped debris implies a present-day mass-loss rate of 1.0-1.6 solar masses per Myr, or 5.6 +/- 1.3% of the current cluster mass per Gyr. These results indicate ongoing tidal stripping of NGC 6569 and quantify its contribution to the bulge field. This paper is part of the Milky Way Bulge Extra-Tidal Star Survey (MWBest) and is our first detailed debris study of a massive bulge globular cluster.</description>

      <title>GW231123: A Case for Binary Microlensing in a Strong Lensing Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unusual properties of GW231123, including component masses within the pair-instability mass gap ($137^{+22}_{-17}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at 90\% credible intervals) and extremely large spins near the Kerr limit, have challenged standard formation scenarios. While gravitational lensing has been proposed as an explanation, current millilensing studies suggest the signal consists of three overlapping images, a configuration that exceeds the predictions of the isolated point-mass lens model. In this work, we investigate a binary lens model embedded within a strong lensing galaxy. This is the simplest model that not only naturally produces the observed number of images but also aligns with the fact that microlensing objects usually reside in galaxies. To overcome the high computational cost of the diffraction integral required for wave optics, we constructed a Transformer-based neural network that accurately generates lensing waveforms within milliseconds per waveform. Using the NRSur7dq4 waveform model, we find primary and secondary lens masses of $714^{+239}_{-309} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $87^{+139}_{-73} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, respectively. We also find a strong lensing magnification of $5.56^{+2.78}_{-1.98}$ (at 90\% credible intervals) and a Bayes factor of $\log_{10}B^\mathrm{Binary}_\mathrm{Single}\simeq1.34$. This result underscores the necessity of considering multi-body and environmental effects in microlensing studies. More crucially, under this embedded binary lens interpretation, the inferred source-frame binary black hole masses ($80.0^{+21.3}_{-14.4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $62.0^{+19.8}_{-29.4} \mathrm{M}_\odot$) and spins ($0.37^{+0.51}_{-0.33}$ and $0.40^{+0.52}_{-0.35}$) shift to values consistent with the current population constrained from O1--O3.</description>

      <title>ALMA Observations of Cold Methanol Gas in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC): N79 South GMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ALMA continuum and molecular line observations at 0.1 pc resolution toward the super star cluster (SSC) candidate H72.97-69.39 in the N79 region of the LMC. The continuum emission has a sharp peak around the SSC candidate but is also widely distributed. We identify two continuum sources at the northern (N79S-1) and northwestern (N79S-2) positions of the SSC continuum peak, associated with CH$_3$OH emission. In addition to CH$_3$OH, we also detect H$_2$CO, H$_2$CS, CS, SO, CO, CN, and CCH at the positions of N79S-1 and N79S-2. The rotation diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and SO lines yields an average gas temperature of 13 $\pm$ 0.4 K for N79S-1 and 15 $\pm$ 0.9 K for N79S-2. Most emission lines exhibit line widths of less than 2.8 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with emissions from cold, dense molecular cloud cores. The abundance of cold CH$_3$OH gas is estimated to be (2.1 $\pm$ 1.1)$\times$ 10$^{-9}$ at N79S-1 and (4.5 $\pm$2.5)$\times$ 10$^{-10}$ at N79S-2. Despite the lower metallicity in the LMC, the CH$_3$OH abundance at N79S-1 is comparable to that of similar cold sources in our Galaxy. However, the formation of organic molecules is inhibited throughout the N79 regions, as can be seen in the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in most of the regions. The two positions N79S-1 and N79S-2 would be exceptional positions, where CH$_3$OH production is efficient. The possible origins of cold CH$_3$OH gas in these dense cores are discussed, along with a possible explanation for the non-detection of CH$_3$OH in the SSC candidate.</description>

      <title>Dynamically close galaxy pairs from the unWISE survey: Testing the merger-AGN-star formation connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are expected to have a profound influence on the star formation histories of galaxies. It is generally expected that mergers are the main drivers of galaxy mass growth through the accretion of mass and the triggering of new star formation episodes, while the shocks and torques induced by the merger may drive gas and dust to central supermassive black holes and fuel active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and producing both positive and negative feedback. We test whether a merger-AGN-star formation connection exists by selecting samples of galaxy pairs of stellar masses log(M/Msun) approximately 10.2 and 11.4 within the redshift of 0.25 at various projected separation and velocity differences in an increasing order, and therefore having a decreasing probability of being truly bound and interacting. We identify galaxies in close pairs and then measure their star formation rates (SFRs) (via their NUV - r colours) and the degree of AGN activity (from X-rays, radio emission at 20cm, WISE infrared colours, and emission line ratios) as a function of their projected separation and velocity difference. We find only weak evidence that galaxies in pairs have higher SFRs as galaxies become closer in projected and velocity separation, except possibly for pairs at closest separation of less than 20 kpc and velocity difference less than 500 km/s. Similarly, we see no strong evidence that AGN are more common for galaxies in closer pairs, irrespective of the method used to detect AGN. For this sample, we do not find any clear evidence that mergers and interactions may play a significant role in triggering star formation and AGN activity, opposite to expectations from theoretical models invoking feedback episodes. Secular processes may be more important, although this may depend on the selection of galaxies and indicators for star formation and AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA): Deconstructing the galaxy stellar mass function by star formation and environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the equatorial Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) dataset, we investigate how the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) varies across different galaxy populations and as a function of halo mass. We find that: (i) The GSMF of passive and star-forming galaxies are well described by a double and a single Schechter function, respectively, although the inclusion of a second component for the star-forming population yields a more accurate description. Furthermore, star-forming galaxies dominate the low-mass end of the total GSMF, whereas passive galaxies mainly shape the intermediate-to-high-mass regime. (ii) The GSMF of central galaxies dominates the high-mass end, whereas satellites and ungrouped galaxies shape the intermediate-to-low-mass regime. Additionally, we find a relative increase in the abundance of low-mass galaxies moving from dense group environments to isolated systems. (iii) More massive halos host more massive galaxies, have a higher fraction of passive systems, and show a steeper decline in the number of intermediate-mass galaxies. Finally, our results reveal larger differences between passive and star-forming GSMFs than predicted by a phenomenological quenching model, but generally confirm the environmental quenching trends for centrals and satellites reported in other works.</description>

      <title>Impact of Galaxy Cluster Environment on the Stellar Mass Function of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters represent some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. They are ideal locations to study the impact of an extreme environment on the evolution of the Stellar Mass Function (SMF), which describes the statistical distribution of galaxies as a function of their stellar masses. In this work, we examine how the SMF of galaxies depends on factors such as the surrounding environments, whether they reside in isolated fields or clusters. We use the 9-band photometric galaxy data of the G9 patch from the Kilo Degree Survey (optical) and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (infrared), containing around 3.7 million galaxies, overlapping with the cluster catalog provided by the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Surveys (eFEDS). After applying appropriate selection criteria, we have 105 eFEDS clusters within the redshift range 0.385-0.8, covering $\sim 46$ square degrees. The large, continuous overlap of the surveys allows us to examine the SMF of the cluster galaxies within the cluster-centric radial bins up to $5R_{500}$. We find a clear detection of the cluster galaxy SMF up to $2R_{500}$ beyond which it's consistent with the background. We divide the cluster sample into redshift, mass, and X-ray luminosity bins to examine their impact on the SMF. The SMF of cluster galaxies for the high-mass clusters shows a decline at low stellar masses ($M_*\lesssim 2\times 10^{10}M_\odot$) within $0-0.5R_{500}$, as compared to a flat SMF for the low-mass clusters, suggesting the low-mass galaxies grow over time before reaching the cluster center. Additionally, we find a flatter SMF for the low redshift bin within $0.5R_{500}$ at stellar masses $M_*&lt; 10^{10}M_\odot$. We also examined the effect of cluster ellipticity on the cluster galaxy SMF; however do not find statistically significant differences between the high and the low ellipticity clusters.</description>

      <title>Deep H{\alpha} survey of the Coma cluster: The Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep wide-field narrow-band imaging survey of the local rich and dynamically relaxed Coma cluster of galaxies, carried out with the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope. The survey covers a region of about 2.5 sq. deg. extending from the core of the cluster out to the infall region over the south-west quadrant of the Coma cluster. The $R$ (6380~\AA) and $[$S$\scriptstyle\rm II$$]$ (6725~\AA) filters of WFC/INT were used to derive the H$\alpha$+[N{\sc ii}] fluxes and equivalent widths of cluster galaxies distributed over a wide range of environmental conditions. The depth of our imaging observations allows us to measure reliably those properties well down into the dwarf regime in the Coma cluster for the first time. We have detected 124 H$\alpha$ emitting sources with spectroscopically-determined membership, 96 of which have not been detected previously. In this paper, we report on the data analysis process and the methodology we used to measure reliable H$\alpha$ properties, and present the measurement catalogue.</description>

      <title>Ionizing Photon Production Efficiencies and Chemical Abundances at Cosmic Dawn Revealed by Ultra-Deep Rest-Frame Optical Spectroscopy of JADES-GS-z14-0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has discovered an early period of galaxy formation that was more vigorous than expected, which has challenged our understanding of the early Universe. In this work, we present the longest spectroscopic integration ever acquired by JWST/MIRI. This spectrum covers the brightest rest-frame optical nebular emission lines for the luminous galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z &gt; 14$. Most notably, we detect $[\mathrm{OIII}] \lambda\lambda 4959,5007$ at $\approx 11 \sigma$ and $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ at $\approx 4 \sigma$ with these ultra-deep observations. These lines reveal that JADES-GS-z14-0 has low dust attenuation with a recent star-formation rate of $\mathrm{SFR} \approx 10 \pm 2\ M_{\odot} / \mathrm{yr}$, star-formation rate surface density of $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}} \approx 23 \pm 5\ M_{\odot}/\mathrm{yr}/\mathrm{kpc}^{2}$, and ionizing photon production efficiency of $\xi_{\mathrm{ion}} \approx 10^{25.3 \pm 0.1}\ \mathrm{Hz/erg}$. Using standard strong-line diagnostics, we infer a gas-phase oxygen abundance of $[\mathrm{O/H}] \approx -1.1 \pm 0.4$ ($\approx 10\%\ Z_{\odot}$), carbon-to-oxygen ratio of $[\mathrm{C/O}] \approx -0.4 \pm 0.4$, ionization parameter of $\mathrm{log}_{10}(U) \gtrsim -2.4$, and density of $n_{\mathrm{H}} \approx 720 \pm 210\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Using detailed photoionization modeling, we instead derive $[\mathrm{O/H}] \approx -0.3_{-0.4}^{+0.4}$ ($\approx 50\%\ Z_{\odot}$) and $\mathrm{log}_{10}(U) \approx -1.5_{-0.4}^{+0.3}$. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 are similar to those measured for similarly luminous galaxies at $z &gt; 10$ with previous MIRI/Spectroscopy, such as GHZ2/GLASSz12, GN-z11, and MACS0647-JD1. Existing simulations are unable to reproduce the empirical and inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0. This work demonstrates an important step toward understanding the formation of the first stars and heavy elements in the Universe. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Pulsational Instability of Quasi-Stars: Interpreting the Variability of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The JWST discovery of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) has revealed a population of compact, red sources at $z \sim 5-10$ that likely host supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed LRD R2211-RX1 reveal century-scale photometric variability and a hysteresis loop in the luminosity-temperature plane, strongly suggesting that the optical emission originates from a pulsating, stellar-like photosphere rather than an accretion disk. This supports the "quasi-star" hypothesis, where a rapidly growing black hole seed is embedded within a massive, radiation-pressure supported envelope. In this work, we investigate the stability of these envelopes using the stellar evolution code MESA coupled with the non-adiabatic oscillation code GYRE. We identify a theoretical "Quasi-Star Instability Strip" with a blue edge at $T_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 5000-5200$ K. Models hotter than this threshold are stable, consistent with the non-variable LRD R2211-RX2 ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 5000$ K), while cooler models are unstable to radial pulsations driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism in helium and hydrogen ionization zones. For quasi-star masses in the range $M_\star \sim 10^4-10^5 M_\odot$, we find that the unstable fundamental radial modes ($\ell =0$, n$_{\rm p}=1$) have periods in the range $\sim 20-180$ years. The first overtone ($\ell =0$, n$_{\rm p}=2$) is also unstable or marginally stable in some of our models, with typical pulsation timescales $\sim 10-30$ years. These oscillations match the co-moving frame variability timescale of RX1. We argue that these violent pulsations likely drive enhanced mass loss analogous to super-AGB winds, which could affect the duration of the quasi-star phase and regulate the final mass of the seeded black hole.</description>

      <title>The Clustering of Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the effective clustering bias parameter, $b_{\rm{eff}}$, at $z\sim5$ for Little Red Dots (LRDs) seeded by Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter (uSIDM). From our model, we find that $b_{\rm{eff}}\sim4.5$, thus we infer that LRDs seeded by uSIDM would populate halos of typical masses $\sim 8\times10^{10}~M_{\odot}$; this bias factor is consistent with LRDs being a distinct population from high redshift quasars. To the extent that we are aware, this is the first formation-based theoretical prediction of LRD clustering from a model consistent with the LRD mass function. We find that this bias and clustering is insensitive to a wide range of the underlying uSIDM microphysics parameters, including the uSIDM cross-section $\sigma/m$ and uSIDM fraction $f$. This is therefore a robust prediction from the uSIDM model, and will allow for direct probes of the uSIDM paradigm as the origin of LRDs in the next few years. Upcoming \texttt{JWST} observations will constrain the population of LRDs, including directly measuring their clustering.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the physics of dwarf galaxies in the 2040s: The case for a next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility with fibres and IFUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies ($M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$) are the most numerous galaxies in the Universe and critical probes of dark matter, baryonic feedback, and galaxy formation. Despite significant progress from wide-field imaging surveys, the majority of dwarf candidates beyond the Local Group will lack spectroscopic follow-up, leaving fundamental questions about their internal kinematics, stellar populations, chemical enrichment, and dark matter content unresolved. Existing and planned facilities cannot efficiently provide the necessary spectroscopy for low-surface-brightness dwarfs over wide areas. We advocate for a dedicated large-aperture ($\geq 20$ m), wide-field, highly multiplexed spectroscopic facility with deployable or monolithic IFUs, capable of high signal-to-noise observations down to $I_{\rm E} \gtrsim 22-23$ mag. Such a facility would enable transformative studies of dark matter cores, baryonic feedback, tidal interactions, environmental effects, and stellar populations, extending the spectroscopic exploration of low-mass galaxies to $z \sim 1.5$, and providing decisive tests of $\Lambda$CDM and alternative dark matter models. Beyond dwarfs, this capability would impact galaxy evolution, strong and weak lensing studies, and cosmology, ensuring that imaging data from the 2030s and 2040s can be fully exploited.</description>

      <title>The size of 3I/ATLAS from non-gravitational acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third macroscopic interstellar object detected in the solar system recently passed through perihelion, with the best-fitting models of its trajectory now featuring non-gravitational accelerations. We assess how much mass loss is required to produce plausible non-gravitational acceleration solutions and compare with estimates of the mass loss. We find that they are consistent when the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS is around 1 km in diameter. For a recent solution with a time lag in the acceleration from Eubanks et al, we find diameters between 820 meters and 1050 meters, assuming an outgassing asymmetry factor $\zeta=0.5$ and a density of the comet nucleus $\rho=0.5$ g cm$^{-3}$. The limits on the diameter scale as $(\zeta/\rho)^{1/3}$. Substantial extrapolation is required in general to compare non-gravitational accelerations to mass loss rates, so reliable estimates of the mass loss rate at other stages of the comet's trajectory will substantially reduce the systematic uncertainty in this estimate.</description>

      <title>Standard Sirens in 2040s: Probing the Cosmic Expansion History with Gravitational Waves and Spectroscopic Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences have matured into a robust cosmological probe, providing self-calibrated luminosity distance measurements independent of any cosmic distance ladder, hence the term "standard sirens". The binary neutron star merger GW170817 delivered the first such measurement of the Hubble constant, demonstrating that GWs offer a path to precision cosmology with systematics orthogonal to standard cosmological probes. To convert GW distances into cosmological parameters, redshift information is essential. To maximize the scientific potential, the redshift must be obtained from individual galaxies, either by identifying electromagnetic counterparts of GW events (bright sirens) or by statistically associating potential hosts within the GW localization volume (dark sirens). The precision of these redshifts sets the achievable accuracy. Forecasts show that photometric uncertainties degrade cosmological constraints by up to an order of magnitude compared to spectroscopic ones. Wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities will therefore be an essential infrastructure for GW cosmology in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Long-Period Variables in M33's Central Region: Insights into Stellar Evolution and Star Formation via Near-Infrared Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of UKIRT observations obtained between 2003 and 2007 to investigate the evolved stellar populations within the central square kiloparsec of M33. Point-spread function (PSF) photometry is employed to mitigate the effects of stellar crowding and to ensure accurate measurements in this densely populated region. This method, applied to merged observations from UIST and WFCAM in the $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands, extracts $211,179$ stars by cross-matching frame-by-frame across 39 observing nights in three bands. From this, we identify approximately 750 long-period variables (LPVs), predominantly Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, by cross-matching PSF results with aperture photometry, focusing on the UIST field for robust variability confirmation. The PSF approach proves particularly effective for resolving blended sources and detecting faint, dusty variables that might remain undetected. We also examined aperture photometry data to validate our results; however, the PSF-derived measurements provide superior depth and completeness, particularly for obscured stellar populations. The resulting master catalog provides a basis for future analyses of variability amplitudes, periods, and star-formation history (SFH), paving the way for a deeper understanding of mass-loss and the dynamical evolution of the central region of M33.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter with logarithmic nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If dark matter is composed of massive bosons, a Bose-Einstein Condensation process must have occurred during the cosmological evolution. Therefore, galactic dark matter may be in a form of a self-gravitating condensate, in the presence of self-interactions. We consider the possibility that the self-interacting potential of the condensate dark matter is of the logarithmic form. In order to describe the condensate dark matter we use the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a logarithmic nonlinearity, and the Thomas-Fermi approximation. With the use of the hydrodynamic representation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we obtain the equation of state of the condensate, which has the form of the ideal gas equation of state, with the pressure proportional to the dark matter density. The basic equation describing the density distribution of the static condensate is derived, and its solution is obtained in the form of a series solution, constructed with the help of the Adomian Decomposition Method. To test the model we consider the properties of the galactic rotation curves in the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter scenario, by using a sample from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) data. The fit of the theoretical predictions of the rotation curves with the observational data indicate that the logarithmic Bose-Einstein Condensate dark matter model gives an acceptable description of the SPARC data, and thus it may be considered as a possible candidate for the in depth understanding of the dark matter properties.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Upper Bound on Micro-lensing Signature of the Highest Mass Binary Black Hole Event GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered gravitational wave (GW) event, GW231123, is the highest mass binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The inferred source masses of GW231123 lie in a mass range where stellar-progenitor black holes are rare to exist due to the pair instability supernovae mass gap, and hence alternative scenarios of origin of this inferred heavy mass black hole become important. One of such hypotheses of its origin is gravitational lensing that introduces modulations to the amplitude and phase of GWs and can make the inferred mass higher from the true value. In this work, we search for the lensing signatures from GW231123 and all other events in a model-independent approach using the technique \texttt{$\mu$-GLANCE} which carries out tests on its residual strain to look for common features across the detector network through cross-correlation and infers the lensing signal in a Bayesian framework. Our analysis tests yield no strong evidence in support for lensing, though it detects presence of potential residual in the data, which can be a micro-lensing signature with a modulation amplitude less than 0.8 at 95\% C.I. However, our study finds that current waveform systematics for such heavy mass binary systems are large enough to shadow the detection of lensing from such short-duration GWs such as GW231123, and hence no concluding claim of lensing could be made at this stage. We conclude that if this event is lensed, then in near future, detection of similar lensed events will take place with current detector sensitivity and hence can open a potential discovery space of lensed GW signal with the aid of more accurate waveform models.</description>

The system employs an SDR-based pipeline to obtain drift-scan observations, which were calibrated and processed to generate HI sky maps, a Galactic rotation curve and spiral arm features. This demonstrates that this low-cost system is effective both for educational purposes and scientific exploration of Galactic structure at radio frequencies.</description>

      <title>GALATEA: The 15-m Galactic Archaeology Spectroscopic Surveyor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textsc{GALATEA} (the \emph{Galactic Archaeology and Local-group Astrophysics Telescope for Extended Areas}) is a concept for a dedicated 15-m, wide-field, 10,000-fibre spectroscopic survey facility in the northern hemisphere, optimized for degree-scale, multi-object spectroscopy. With a $\sim 1~\mathrm{deg}^2$ corrected field-of-view and both medium- ($R \simeq 5{,}000$--$10{,}000$) and high-resolution ($R \simeq 20{,}000$--$25{,}000$) modes, \textsc{GALATEA} would open a new regime in Galactic and Local Group astronomy: deep, chemically detailed spectroscopy of vast samples of individual stars in the outer disc, warp, flare, halo substructures, M31, M33 and their dwarf satellites, far beyond the reach of current surveys. By delivering precise radial velocities and detailed chemical abundances for stars with exquisite astrometry and photometry from \emph{Gaia} and its proposed near-infrared successor \emph{GaiaNIR}, \textsc{GALATEA} will complete and fully exploit the 6D phase-space and chemodynamical information for these populations. Compared to existing northern multi-object spectroscopic facilities (BOSS, APOGEE, DESI, LAMOST, WEAVE, PFS), \textsc{GALATEA} delivers an order-of-magnitude jump in survey power ($\propto D^{2} \times N_{\mathrm{fibres}}$) by combining a 15-m aperture, $\sim 1~\mathrm{deg}^2$ field, and 10{,}000 fibres in a single dedicated facility. It is also strongly complementary to 30--40\,m ELTs: GALATEA provides the wide-field, high-multiplex discovery and chemodynamical mapping, while ELTs deliver deep, high-resolution follow-up of the faintest or most complex targets.</description>

      <title>Revealing the intricacies of radio galaxies and filaments in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2255. II. Properties of filaments using multi-frequency radio data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to further analyze the filaments in Abell 2255 combining LOFAR data with uGMRT (1260 MHz) and VLA (1520 MHz) data to constrain the spectral shape of the filaments. This allows studying their morphological properties, required to understand their origin, at unprecedentedly high resolution (~2.3 kpc), crucial to disentangle the different cosmic ray components that populate the Original TRG. We produced a LOFAR-VLBI map at 1.5" resolution using the wide-field technique with 56 hours of observations. This was the first time this technique was used for a galaxy cluster, especially for such deep observations. uGMRT and VLA data have been calibrated and imaged to produce spectral index maps and to apply further techniques to extract additional information, such as the radiative ages of the filaments or their equipartition magnetic field. Polarization information was also obtained using VLA through the rotation measure synthesis technique. Thanks to the LOFAR-VLBI wide-field image at 144 MHz, we revealed additional, very steep ($\alpha &gt; 2$) filaments beyond those attached to the radio galaxy, extending for around 250 kpc and previously known as the Trail. Combining LOFAR-VLBI with uGMRT and VLA, we found integrated spectral values between 1.1-1.7 for the filaments. Spectral analysis revealed also that the Original TRG has a complex structure, showing overlapping features with distinct spectral indices that extend throughout its tail. Polarized emission emerges only from the tail and the brightest part of the filaments, with values up to $22\%$. Although there is no clear scenario regarding the formation of filaments, we highlight the importance of the Original TRG as the main driver of such structures, even at larger distances from the core.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Differential Radial Velocities of C3PO Wide Binaries: A Test of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wide-binary stars, separated by thousands of AU, reside in low-acceleration regimes where Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predicts deviation from Newtonian gravity. However, Gaia radial velocities (RVs) lack the precision to resolve the small velocity differences expected in these systems, limiting previous MOND analyses to two-dimensional kinematics. In this paper, we introduce a technique to measure differential RVs of wide binary stars using high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra. We apply this method to measure differential RVs of 100 wide-binaries from the C3PO survey and achieved precisions of $8-15$ m/s per binary pair, a $\sim 10-100 \times$ improvement (median $\sim 24 \times$) over Gaia DR3. Combining these measurements with Gaia astrometry, we construct a hierarchical Bayesian model to infer the orbital elements of all wide-binary pairs and the global MOND acceleration scale ($a_0$). We test two commonly used interpolating functions in MOND formulation: the simple form ($b=1, \mu = x/(1+x)$) and the standard form ($b=2, \mu = x/\sqrt{1+x^2}$). Our results indicate tension with MOND at the presently accepted $a_0$ value: for $b=1$, the canonical value is excluded at $3.1\sigma$, while for $b=2$, the exclusion is at $1.9\sigma$.</description>

      <title>A cosmologist's take on Little Red Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift sources, the Little Red Dots (LRDs), which may host supermassive black holes (BHs) significantly heavier than their stellar content compared with local scaling relations. These objects challenge standard models of early galaxy formation and may represent an extreme class of early BH hosts. In this paper, we investigate whether these BHs could have a primordial origin. We first show that the direct formation of these BH masses in the early Universe is excluded by stringent CMB $\mu$-distortion limits. We then investigate the assembly of massive BHs from lighter, observationally allowed primordial black holes (PBHs) via hierarchical mergers, finding that, although this channel can operate depending on the merger history, it faces challenges in explaining the observations due to the rarity of the required high-redshift dark matter halos. Finally, we estimate gas accretion onto intermediate-mass PBHs, while jointly tracking metallicity evolution, and identify regions of parameter space in which such growth could reproduce the observed properties of LRDs. As a special case, we focus on the strongly lensed source QSO1, whose extremely low metallicity and large mass provide a stringent test of these formation channels.</description>

      <title>The link between galaxy merger, radio jet expansion and molecular outflow in the ULIRG IRAS 00183-7111</title>

Abstract: The ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 00183-7111 ($z=0.328$) is one of the three ULIRGs that are currently known to host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with small-scale radio jets. We present a detailed study of the link between galaxy merger, AGN ignition, radio jet expansion and kpc-scale molecular outflow in IRAS 00183-7111, using high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(3-2) lines and very deep $i$-band VLT Survey Telescope (VST) imaging. The latter allows us to put constraints on the assembly history of the system, suggesting that it formed through a major merger between two gas-rich spirals, likely characterised by a prograde encounter and no older than $\approx2$~Gyr. The recent merger channelled about $(1.5\pm0.3)\times10^{10}$~M\textsubscript{$\odot$} of molecular gas in the central regions of the remnant, as traced by the CO detections. The spatial correlation between the CO distribution and the radio core suggests that this gas likely contributed to the ignition of the AGN and thus to the launch of the radio jets. Furthermore, by comparing the relative strength of the two CO transitions, we find extreme gas excitation (i.e.\,$T_{\rm ex}\gg50$~K) around the radio lobes, supporting the case for a jet-ISM interaction. A qualitative study of the CO kinematics also demonstrates that, despite the overall disturbed dynamical state with no clear signs of regular rotation, at least one non-rotational kinematic component can be identified and likely associated to an outflow with $v_{\rm out}\approx439$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $\dot{M_{\rm out}}\approx 609$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Equation vs. AI: Predict Density and Measure Width of molecular clouds by Multiscale Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar medium widely exists in the universe at multi-scales. In this study, we introduce the {\it Multi-scale Decomposition Reconstruction} method, an equation-based model designed to derive width maps of interstellar medium structures and predict their volume density distribution in the plane of the sky from input column density data. This approach applies the {\it Constrained Diffusion Algorithm}, based on a simple yet common physical picture: as molecular clouds evolve to form stars, the density of interstellar medium increases while their scale decreases. Extensive testing on simulations confirms that this method accurately predicts volume density with minimal error. Notably, the equation-based model performs comparably or even more accurately than the AI-based DDPM model(Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), which relies on numerous parameters and high computational resources. Unlike the "black-box" nature of AI, our equation-based model offers full transparency, making it easier to interpret, debug, and validate. Their simplicity, interpretability, and computational efficiency make them indispensable not only for understanding complex astrophysical phenomena but also for complementing and enhancing AI-based methods.</description>

      <title>Mysteries of Capotauro: investigating the puzzling nature of an extreme F356W-dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has uncovered a diverse population of extreme near-infrared dropouts, including ultra high-redshift ($z&gt;15$) galaxy candidates, dust-obscured galaxies challenging dust production theories, sources with strong Balmer breaks - possibly compact AGN in dense environments - and cold, sub-stellar Galactic objects. This work presents Capotauro, a F356W-dropout in the CEERS survey with F444W AB magnitude of $\sim27.68$ and a sharp $&gt;3$ mag flux drop between $3.5{-}4.5\,\mu$m, undetected below $3.5\,\mu$m. We combine JWST/NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/MSA data with HST/ACS and WFC3 observations to perform a spectro-photometric analysis of Capotauro using multiple SED-fitting codes. Our setup tests $z\geq15$ as well as $z&lt;10$ dusty, Balmer-break or strong-line galaxy solutions, and the possibility of Capotauro being a Milky Way sub-stellar object. Among extragalactic options, our analysis favors interpreting the sharp drop as a Lyman break at $z\sim32$, consistent with the epoch of formation of the first stars and black holes, with only $\sim0.5\%$ of the posterior volume at $z&lt;25$. Lower-redshift solutions struggle to reproduce the extreme break, suggesting that if Capotauro lies at $z&lt;10$, it must show a non-standard combination of strong dust attenuation and/or Balmer breaks, making it a peculiar interloper. Alternatively, its properties match a very cold (Y2-Y3 type) brown dwarf or a free-floating exoplanet with a record-breaking combination of low temperature and large distance ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;300\,\mathrm{K}$, $d\gtrsim130\,\mathrm{pc}$, up to $\sim2\,\mathrm{kpc}$). While current data cannot determine its nature, Capotauro emerges as a remarkably unique object in all plausible scenarios, and a compelling target for follow-up.</description>

      <title>Active galactic nuclei-heated dust revealed in "little red dots"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this {work}, we performed a comprehensive stacking analysis of NIRCam, MIRI, and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We report clear evidence of hot-dust emission in the median stacked spectral energy distribution (SED) that features a rising near-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, which is best explained by a standard dusty active galactic nucleus (AGN) structure. Although LRDs are likely to be a heterogeneous population, our findings suggest that most ($\gtrsim$50 %) LRDs show AGN-heated dust emission, regardless of whether the optical and ultraviolet (UV) continua are stellar or AGN-dominated. In either case, the best-fit dusty-AGN SED, combined with the lack of X-ray detection in the deep Chandra stacks, suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$&gt;$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). Therefore, we argue that AGN-heated dust does not directly obscure either the optical-UV continuum or the broad-line region emission, in order to explain the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. While a gas-dust displacement is in line with several models, the formation scenario (in-situ or ex-situ) of this pre-enriched hot dust remains unclear.</description>

Abstract: Stellar collisions in dense galactic nuclei might play an important role in fueling supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and shaping their environments. The gas released during these collisions can contribute to SMBH accretion, influencing phenomena such as active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events of the remnants. We address the challenge of rapidly and accurately predicting the outcomes of stellar collisionsincluding remnant masses and unbound gasacross a broad parameter space of initial conditions. Existing smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic (SPH) simulation techniques, while detailed, are too resource-intensive for exploratory studies or real-time applications. We develop a machine learning framework trained on a dataset of $\sim 16,000$ SPH simulations of main-sequence star collisions. By extracting physically meaningful parameters (e.g., masses, radii, impact parameters, and virial ratios) and employing gradient-boosted regression trees with Huber loss, we create a model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. The method includes logarithmic transforms to handle dynamic ranges and regularization to ensure physical plausibility. The model achieves predictions of collision outcomes (remnant masses, and unbound mass) with very low mean absolute errors respect to the typical mass scale. It operates in fractions of a second, enabling large-scale parameter studies and real-time applications. Parameter importance analysis reveals that the impact parameter and the relative velocity dominate outcomes, aligning with theoretical expectations. Our approach provides a scalable tool for studying stellar collisions in galactic nuclei. The rapid predictions facilitate investigations into gas supply for SMBH accretion and the cumulative effects of collisions over cosmic time, particularly relevant to address the growth of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>The Colors of Ices: Measuring ice column density through photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ices imprint strong absorption features in the near- and mid-infrared, but until recently they have been studied almost exclusively with spectroscopy toward small samples of bright sources. We show that JWST photometry alone can reveal and quantify interstellar ices, and we present a new open-source modeling tool, icemodels, to produce synthetic photometry of ices based on laboratory measurements. We provide reference tables indicating which filters are likely to be observably affected by ice absorption. Applying these models to NIRCam data of background stars behind \refereeseveral Galactic Center (GC) clouds \referee(dust ridge clouds A [the Brick], C, and D), and validating against NIRSpec spectra of Galactic disk sources, we find clear signatures of CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ ices and evidence for excess absorption in the F356W filter likely caused by CH-bearing species such as methanol. The ice ratios differ between the Galactic disk and Center, with GC clouds showing a higher H$_2$O fraction. \refereeA large ice abundance \refereeis observed in CO, H2O, and possibly complex molecules, \refereewhich implies that there is substantial freezeout and therefore potential for ice-phase chemistry in non-star-forming gas. Accounting for all likely ices, we infer that $&gt;25%$ of the total carbon is frozen into CO ice in the GC, which exceeds the entire solar-neighborhood carbon budget. By assuming the freezeout fraction is the same in GC and disk clouds, we obtain a metallicity measurement indicating that $Z_GC\gtrsim2.5Z_\odot$. These results demonstrate that photometric ice measurements are feasible with JWST and capable of probing the metallicity structure of the cold interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic characterization of a remarkable temporally varying, triple-lensed quasar at z=2.67</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed quasars are viable cosmic tools for constraining a diversity of fundamental astrophysical phenomena; They enable identification of faint, low-mass supermassive black holes, provide unique constraints on the intervening intergalactic or interstellar medium in their sightlines, and can be used to determine key cosmological quantities such as the Hubble constant, $H_0$. However, they are rare phenomena, and it has proven difficult to define efficient, unbiased selection methods.} In this study, we report the independent spectroscopic identification of a remarkable triple-lensed quasar at $z=2.67$, identified based on astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, previously identified in Pan-STARRS. Furthermore, a larger spectroscopic follow-up survey of {\em Gaia}-detected candidate lensed quasars. We characterize in detail the three mirror images of the quasar and their spatial and temporal spectroscopic coverage, with focus on the emission-line properties which shows variation across sigthlines and temporal evolution over the $\sim 11$months spectroscopic campaign. We construct a lens model of the foreground source from a combination of the multiple spectra and deep optical imaging, providing a robust halo mass of $M_{\rm h} = (2.78 \pm 0.05)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$. Based on the lens model, the time delay between each sightline is translated into an intrinsic quasar time, allowing us to construct a quasar timeseries over $\sim18$months with monthly cadence. Over months timescales the broad emission lines vary in both velocity offset and equivalent width (EW) as well as an overall increase in ionization. This exemplary triple-lensed quasars demonstrates the viability of identifying such rare lens configurations based purely on the astrometric measurements from the {\em Gaia} mission, which we here provide optimized selection criteria for, for future studies.</description>

      <title>GLIMPSE-D: An Exotic Balmer-Jump Object at z=6.20? Revisiting Photometric Selection and the Cosmic Abundance of Pop III Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy of GLIMPSE-16043, a promising $z\sim6$ Pop III candidate originally identified through NIRCam photometry as having weak [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ emission. Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature. However, the combination of the measured line fluxes and photometry indicates that its spectral energy distribution requires an extraordinarily strong Balmer jump ($-1.66 \pm 0.47$ mag) and H$\alpha$ equivalent width ($3750\pm1800$ \AA), features that cannot be reproduced by current stellar+nebular or pure nebular photoionization models. The only models approaching the observations to almost within $1\sigma$ involve a hot ($T_{\rm eff}\!\simeq\!10^{4.7}$ K) single blackbody embedded in a low-$T_{\rm e}$ nebular environment, suggestive of scenarios such as a tidal-disruption event or a microquasar with strong disk winds. This cautions that photometric Pop~III selections are vulnerable to contamination when the rest-frame optical continuum is undetected. Motivated by this, we refine the photometric Pop III selection criteria to exclude the locus of extreme Balmer-jump objects. The revised criteria also recover the recently reported spectroscopic candidate AMORE6, demonstrating that the updated selection preserves sensitivity to genuine Pop III-like sources while removing key contaminants. Applying the refined criteria across legacy survey fields and five newly released CANUCS lensing cluster fields, we revisit the Pop III UV luminosity function and estimate the Pop III cosmic star-formation rate density to be $\approx[10^{-6}$--$10^{-4}]$~$M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$~cMpc$^{-3}$ at $z\simeq6$--7, falling in the range of current theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Observations of AGN-driven feedback: dynamics and ionization of the filaments in M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$\alpha$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.</description>

      <title>An Enhanced Thermodynamic Framework for Third-Order Galaxy Correlation Functions: A Physically Motivated Closure and Observational Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-point correlation function (3PCF) is a crucial probe of non-Gaussianity and nonlinear structure formation. We develop a thermodynamic framework for the galaxy 3PCF by closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a physically motivated hierarchical ansatz, yielding a separable, analytic solution for the equilateral 3PCF. Our framework addresses the apparent discrepancy between the perturbation theory prediction for dark matter ($Q_{dm} \approx 1.6$) and observed galaxy measurements ($Q_{gal} \approx 0.5$) by incorporating thermodynamic virial effects and velocity dispersion. We validate this model with SDSS/BOSS CMASS measurements, obtaining an excellent fit ($\chi^2/\mathrm{dof} = 1.27$) across $1$-$50,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The analysis utilizes the Szapudi-Szalay estimator with robust covariance estimation from the SLICS simulation suite. By linking the thermodynamic temperature $T$ to the small-scale velocity dispersion (Fingers-of-God), we establish the thermodynamic approach as a predictive, complementary description of higher-order galaxy clustering on quasi-linear scales.</description>

      <title>SPAN: A cross-platform Python GUI software for optical and near-infrared spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of high-quality optical and near-infrared spectroscopic data, as well as advances in modelling techniques, have greatly expanded the scientific potential of spectroscopic studies. However, the software tools needed to fully exploit this potential often remain fragmented across multiple specialised packages, requiring scripting skills and manual integration to handle complex workflows. In this paper we present SPAN (SPectral ANalysis), a cross-platform, Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) software that unifies the essential tools for modern spectral analysis within a single, user-friendly environment. While SPAN can be used with a variety of spectroscopic targets, its primary focus is the analysis of unresolved galaxy spectra. SPAN allows users to extract 1D spectra from FITS images and datacubes, perform spectral processing (e.g. Doppler correction, continuum modelling, denoising), and carry out detailed analyses, including line-strength measurements, stellar and gas kinematics, and stellar population studies, using both built-in routines and the widely adopted pPXF algorithm for full spectral fitting. It runs natively on Windows, Linux, macOS, and Android, and is fully task-driven, requiring no prior coding experience. We validate SPAN by comparing its output with existing pipelines and literature studies.

      <title>MCI: Multi-Channel Imager on the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The MCI provides three imaging channels, which are the NUV channel, the Blue channel and the Red channel, with the wavelength range of 255-430 nm, 430-700 nm, and 700-1000 nm, respectively. MCI's three channels can target the same field simultaneously, which is unique compared to other imagers onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) or the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Each channel employs a CCD focal plane of 9216 x 9232 pixels and $\sim$7\arcmin.5 x 7\arcmin.5 field of view (FOV), which are about $\gtrsim 4$ times greater than the FOVs of HST imagers. The MCI's three channels feature unprecedented sensitivities and field of views complement the NUV and visible capabilities of the CSST for high-precision photometry and weak-signal detection, which would help build a new standard-star system and the deepest UV-Optical exposures for CSST. Rich filter sets of MCI would help explore other sciences such as local emission line mapping, high-z Ly$\alpha$ emitters searching, etc. Here we present key design features, results of current ground tests, and suggested observing strategies of the MCI.</description>

      <title>Echoes from the dark: Galaxy catalog incompleteness in standard siren cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations can be combined with galaxy catalogs to constrain cosmology and test modified gravity theories using the standard siren method. However, galaxy catalogs are intrinsically incomplete due to observational limitations, potentially leaving host galaxies undetected, thereby weakening constraints and potentially introducing systematic errors. In this work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog incompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly available CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical population constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs with varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We find percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching precisions of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass weighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades following a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for stronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH population mass scale increases, making results more sensitive to assumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision remains achievable even when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host galaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision requires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared. The results are robust against host weighting mismodeling, even at moderate completeness levels. This work further highlights the importance of spectroscopic galaxy surveys in standard siren cosmology and provides a pathway for developing the science case of future facilities.</description>

      <title>Transverse Velocities in Real-Time Cosmology: Position Drift in Relativistic N-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The era of real-time cosmology has begun. It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity, which is notoriously difficult to measure and is typically inferred statistically from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Formation of protostars and the launching of stellar core outflows with moving-mesh radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12620v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an implementation of radiative transfer with flux-limited diffusion (FLD) for the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO} and use the method in a physical model for the formation of protostars with non-ideal radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD). We follow previous work in splitting the additional terms to the hydrodynamical equations arising from the inclusion of radiation into terms to be integrated explicitly and implicitly, as the diffusion and coupling terms would impose very restrictive timestep criteria. We validate the scheme with standard test problems for radiation diffusion, matter-gas coupling, and radiative shocks from the literature. Our implementation is compatible with local timestepping, which often presents problems for implicit schemes, and we found very good agreement with results obtained with global timesteps. We present an example application of the new implementation to the collapse of a $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ molecular cloud core to a second Larson core modelled with radiation non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. A high-velocity jet with v$_{\rm rad}&gt; 10\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ is self-consistently launched from the second core, nested within the first core, which produces a lower-velocity magnetorotational outflow. We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}&gt;10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small (&lt;0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Evolution and Detectability of Nova Remnants in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of X-ray sources have been detected in the Galactic center (GC), most believed to be cataclysmic variables (CVs). As a potential probe of the old stellar population, in particular CVs, the existence and detectability of novae in the GC remain elusive, due to the prohibitive extinction toward the GC and their relatively low occurrence rate. Nova remnants evolving in the characteristic hot ($T\sim{10^{6}~\rm K}$) and dense ($n_e\sim{10~\rm cm^{-3}}$) interstellar medium in the GC may shed light on recent novae and provide useful insight on the GC ecosystem. In this work, we perform hydrodynamical simulations of putative nova remnants in the GC environment and calculate their time-dependent multiwavelength emission to estimate the detectability. Among 79 models sampling the nova parameter space (primarily ejecta mass and velocity), 6, 44, and 51 modelled nova remnants are detectable at their X-ray, radio, and Paschen-$\alpha$ maximum, respectively, for existing Chandra, VLA, and HST observations of the GC. The predicted peak luminosities are $\sim10^{32}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, $\sim10^{31}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, and $\sim10^{36}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$ in these three bands and the detectable window ranges from weeks to notably hundred years. By specifying a CV population of the nuclear star cluster, we estimate the probability of detecting at least one remnant to be 20%, 8%, and 18% in X-rays, radio, and Pa$\alpha$. The nova remnant would be best resolved in the X-ray band. Our study highlights the potential for detecting nova remnants through further observations, leveraging JWST and the potentially forthcoming AXIS and SKA.</description>
