      <title>COSINE (Cometary Object Study Investigating their Nature and Evolution) I. Project Overview and General Characteristics of Detected Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results from the COSINE (Cometary Object Study Investigating their Nature and Evolution) project, based on a uniformly processed dataset of 484 comets observed over the full 15-year duration of the WISE/NEOWISE mission. This compilation includes 1,633 coadded images spanning 966 epochs with signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) greater than 4, representing the largest consistently analyzed infrared comet dataset obtained from a single instrument. Dynamical classification identifies 234 long-period (LPCs) and 250 short-period comets (SPCs), spanning heliocentric distances of 0.996--10.804 au. LPCs are statistically brighter than SPCs in the W1 (3.4 um) and W2 (4.6 um) bands at comparable heliocentric distances. Cometary activity peaks near perihelion, with SPCs exhibiting a pronounced post-perihelion asymmetry. Multi-epoch photometry reveals that SPCs show steeper brightening and fading slopes than LPCs. The observing geometry of WISE/NEOWISE -- constrained to a fixed ~90-deg solar elongation from low-Earth orbit -- introduces systematic biases in the sampling of orientation angles for extended features. Collectively, the results reveal a continuous evolutionary gradient across comet populations, likely driven by accumulated solar heating and surface processing. This study establishes a foundation for subsequent COSINE analyses, which will separate nucleus and coma contributions and model dust dynamics to further probe cometary activity and evolution.</description>

      <title>TrES-1 b: A Case Study in Detecting Secular Evolution of Exoplanet Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of transit, eclipse, and radial velocity data of the hot Jupiter TrES-1 b and confirm evidence of orbital variations on secular timescales. Apparent variations due to systemic motion and light travel time effects have been ruled out, indicating that the observed changes are dynamical in origin. Joint modeling of the TrES-1 b data favors an apsidal precession model, but the rapid precession rate of $4^\circ$ yr$^{-1}$ cannot be explained without invoking an undetected close-in planetary companion, which remains unseen in the data. While radial velocity measurements reveal a previously undetected companion candidate on a wide, eccentric orbit, it is unlikely to drive the observed evolution of TrES-1 b. However, an orbital decay model provides a plausible alternative if the loss of orbital energy is driven by planetary obliquity tides. We find that the best-fit orbital decay rate of $-7.1^{ +1.5}_{-1.6}$ ms yr$^{-1}$ is aligned with theoretical predictions for modified tidal quality factors of hot Jupiters if TrES-1 b has a planetary obliquity $\varepsilon_p &gt; 30^\circ$. We encourage follow-up observations of this system, particularly of eclipse timing and radial velocities, to further constrain the nature of the observed evolution. This paper provides a practical framework for studying secular variations and aims to accelerate future research on similar systems.</description>

      <title>Mineral cloud formation above magma oceans in sub-Neptune atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential presence of a magma surface below a thick atmosphere primarily composed of hydrogen in some sub-Neptune exoplanets suggests a strong link between the interior composition and atmosphere through chemical coupling of volatile and refractory species. In this study, we aim to model the possibility for mineral cloud formation in the atmosphere of sub-Neptunes from outgassing of refractory species at the magma surface. In our specific cases, we find that mineral clouds easily form near the magma-atmosphere boundary, but also higher in the atmosphere once vapour is mixed to the cooler atmospheric regions. We find that the vertical cloud structure depends on the mixing profile of the atmosphere, with stronger mixing allowing particles to remain lofted in the atmosphere, while weak to moderate mixing produces larger, more sedimented cloud particle profiles. We suggest that due to the strong thermal feedback from cloud opacity, clouds may play an important role in the overall structure of the interior-surface-atmosphere coupled system in sub-Neptunes, as well as affect their observed spectral properties, especially at near-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Condensation Clouds in Substellar Atmospheres with Virga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present an open-source cloud model for substellar atmospheres, called Virga. The Virga-v0 series has already been widely adopted in the literature. It is written in Python and has heritage from the Ackerman &amp; Marley (2001) model (often referred to as eddysed), used to study clouds on both exoplanets and brown dwarfs. In the development of the official Virga-v1 we have retained all the original functionality of eddysed and updated/expanded several components including the back-end optical constants data, calculations of the Mie properties, available condensate species, saturation vapor pressure curves and formalism for fall speeds calculations. Here we benchmark Virga by reproducing key results in the literature, including the SiO2 cloud detection in WASP-17 b and the brown dwarf Diamondback-Sonora model series. Development of Virga is ongoing, with future versions already planned and ready for release. We encourage community feedback and collaborations within the GitHub code repository.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Hazardous Near-Earth Object Detection: A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Resampling Strategies and Machine Learning Algorithms in Planetary Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation. Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and 0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.</description>

      <title>Carbon-rich Sub-Neptune Interiors Are Compatible with JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many possible interior compositions exist for sub-Neptunes: ice-poor, ice-rich, and water-dominated interiors can all match the measured masses and radii. Motivated by recent theory of carbon-rich planet formation outside of the refractory organic carbon "soot line" and observations of carbon-rich protoplanetary disks around late M dwarfs, we propose another possible sub-Neptune composition: a carbon-rich composition consisting of an iron-silicate core, a carbon layer, and a hydrogen/helium-dominated envelope. We show that the interiors of three prototypical sub-Neptunes with high-quality spectral observations - TOI-270 d, GJ 1214 b, and K2-18 b - are consistent with carbon-rich compositions if they have $\leq100\times$ solar metallicity atmospheres. We further show that carbon-rich interiors lead to atmospheric compositions that match HST and JWST observations. Simulated carbon-rich TOI-270 d transmission spectra pass the $\chi^2$ test under a wide range of C/O, haze, and cloud scenarios. K2-18 b spectral models are broadly consistent with observation, but requires additional sources for carbon species to be fully compatible. GJ 1214 b models, however, are incompatible with observations, ruling out a carbon-rich interior composition, if the atmosphere of the planet is primordial and reflects interior C/O.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>

      <title>Lunar geochemistry from X-ray line flux ratios using CLASS on Chandrayaan 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global lunar chemical maps are essential for understanding the origin and evolution of the Moon, its surface characteristics, and its potential for resource extraction. Lunar elemental abundance maps have been derived using X-ray and gamma ray spectroscopy previously but are limited in coverage or have coarse spatial resolution. Here we used X-ray fluorescence line intensity of O, Mg, Al, Si, Ca and Fe derived from five years of data from the Chandrayaan-2 Large Area Soft X-ray Spectrometer (CLASS) to generate global O/Si, Mg/Si, Al/Si, Mg/Al, Ca/Si and Fe/Si line intensity ratio maps at a resolution of 5.3 km/pixel. We have developed an independent data analysis methodology for CLASS, based on open source Python packages. Our analysis shows that the Mg/Al map best represents the geochemical differences between the major terranes, consistent with the findings of the Apollo 15 and 16 X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRS) maps. We have also shown a good correlation of the line intensity ratios with the abundance ratios from CLASS using published elemental abundance maps. Further, we apply Gaussian mixture models to the Mg/Si vs Al/Si density maps to map geochemically distinct regions on the Moon that could be of interest for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric landslides on small planetary bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to understand how landslides affect the shape and rotational motion of small rubble planetary bodies. We limit ourselves to axisymmetric global landslides, and take the primordial shape of the body to also be axisymmetric. The landslides are modeled through depth-averaging, while also incorporating the effect of the body's rotation, topographical changes due to multiple landslides, the body's non-uniform gravity field and possible surface mass shedding. The body's rotational dynamics is coupled to its shape change due to landsliding, and also includes the action of radiation torque. We utilize our model to investigate regolith motion on actual asteroids. We then study the evolution of the shape and spin state of an initially spherical rubble asteroid due to impact-induced global landsliding events over its lifetime. We find that rotational fission is suppressed by regolith redistribution to the body's equator by landsliding. Furthermore, top shapes are rapidly formed and this may explain the abundance of top-shaped asteroids in near-Earth orbits.</description>

      <title>3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1): Direct Spacecraft Exploration of a Possible Relic of Planetary Formation at "Cosmic Noon"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS (also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), henceforth, 3I), discovered by the ATLAS Chile telescope on 2025 July 1, was rapidly revealed to be the third known interstellar object (ISO) transiting the solar system, with an incoming velocity at infinity of 57.9763 $\pm$ 0.0044 km s$^{-1}$. An examination of 3I's pre-encounter kinematics shows that it is likely to be an object from the galactic thick disk, and thus a remnant of the Galaxy's ``cosmic noon'' period of intense star formation $\sim$9 - 13 gigayears ago. This kinematic assignment of 3I to the thick disk can be tested observationally in the transit of 3I through the solar system. Unfortunately for terrestrial observers, the 3I perihelion will happen when it is on the other side of the Sun as seen from Earth, at a solar elongation of 12.80 degrees, rendering observation from Earth (or near-Earth space telescopes) hard or impossible. With a retrograde orbit inclined 175.114 degrees (only 4.886 degrees from the ecliptic plane), and a trajectory passing inside the orbit of Mars, 3I will pass relatively close to a number of already launched interplanetary spacecraft. We find a strong science case for observations in the periods of the close approaches of the Psyche spacecraft on 2025 September 4, at 0.302 AU, the martian spacecraft array on 2025 October 3, and the Juice spacecraft on 2025 November 4. In addition, the Europa Clipper, Hera and even the more distant Lucy spacecraft may pass through 3I's cometary tail in the period after its perihelion passage, potentially directly observing the conditions and composition there. Spacecraft observations could, to the extent they are possible, provide the only source of spectral and imaging data during the 3I perihelion passage.</description>

      <title>Hard X-ray Contribution in AU Mic Flares and Its Minor Role in Atmospheric Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flares from stars can significantly impact the atmospheres of their orbiting planets, yet the role of hard X-ray (HXR; 3-20 keV) emission in driving escape and tracing particle acceleration remains poorly constrained. With the aim of quantifying the HXR share of the total radiative budget, we obtained a NuSTAR observation, quasi-simultaneous with Swift and Einstein Probe observations, of the young M1Ve star AU Mic, detecting two flares. We build an empirical soft X-ray (SXR; 0.3-3 keV)-HXR scaling relation and, on that basis, quantify the HXR share of the total radiative budget, defined as the sum of extreme ultraviolet (EUV; 0.01-0.3 keV), SXR, and HXR, and assess its effect on atmospheric escape. We find that the HXR fraction is 1.7% in quiescence and rises to 3.3% at flare peaks; even adopting the EUV + SXR (collectively referred to as XUV) escape efficiency as an upper bound, HXR-powered mass loss amounts to only a few percent of the XUV-driven rate. High-energy spectral tails are detected in quiescence and in Flare 2. Both nonthermal and high temperature thermal models provide acceptable fits to the data; however, the presence of two localized Neupert effect episodes in Flare 2, combined with the implausibly large energy budget required for a 290 MK plasma, strongly favors a nonthermal interpretation. Consistent with this picture, spectral-timing analysis shows that the 6-20 keV share of the emission actually declines during flares, while heating is dominated by 3-6 keV photons-implying rapid thermalization of accelerated electrons and a predominantly thermal energy release. Overall, the flares are thermally dominated, nonthermal electrons can power chromospheric heating episodically, but HXR-induced escape appears to be marginal for the long-term atmospheric evolution of AU Mic's planets.</description>

      <title>Detecting Extraterrestrial Civilizations That Employ an Earth-level Deep Space Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major aspect of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) involves searching for electromagnetic transmissions from extraterrestrial sources, often using our own transmissions as a guide. Previous studies have suggested that humanity's most consistently detectable technosignatures were transmissions from our deep-space networks and interplanetary radar. In this study, we analyze NASA Deep Space Network logs to explore what strategies for selecting SETI targets and scheduling observations would enhance the chances of detecting such networks. Analyzing Deep Space Network uplink transmission logs over the last 20 yr, we find that these emissions were predominantly directed along the ecliptic plane, towards or directly away from the Sun, and towards other planets. The average duty cycle within the Earth Transit Zone is 20 times higher than that across all ecliptic latitudes. In the case of Mars, we find a species that is able to observe the Solar System for radio emission during an Earth-Mars conjunction in the past 20 yr would have had a 77% chance of observing during one of our transmissions, a $4\times10^5$-fold increase over intercepting our Deep Space Network transmission versus a random observer at a random time. These findings quantify how SETI searches might benefit from prioritizing edge-on exoplanet systems and aligning observation windows with exoplanetary conjunctions or planet-planet occultations because they significantly improve the likelihood of intercepting transmissions from any civilizations employing deep-space networks similar to our own.</description>

      <title>The Large Smooth Patch on Comet 9P/Tempel 1: Remnant of a Past Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive reassessment of the region containing the large smooth patch on comet 9P/Tempel 1, leveraging data from the Deep Impact and Stardust-NExT missions, an updated stereophotoclinometry-based shape model, and numerical simulations. The study seeks to understand the nature, the triggering mechanism, and the chronology of this distinctive feature. Morphological and spectral analysis reveals that the smooth patch has a thickness of approximately 25 meters, a notable lobate U-shape, and a spectral composition indistinguishable from the surrounding terrain, which favors an endogenous origin. Gravitational flow simulations demonstrate that a single event could have formed the large smooth patch, the secondary smooth units observed on other faces of the comet, and the mass wasting features adjacent to the northern smooth unit. We estimate this event occurred between 600 and 1,000 years ago, a temporal window that notably coincides with a period of abrupt orbital changes caused by multiple close encounters with Jupiter. We propose that the gravitational stresses experienced during these encounters triggered a mass flow, providing the most coherent explanation for the formation and uniqueness of this geological feature on Tempel 1. These shed new light on the geology of cometary nuclei and the role of external dynamic processes in shaping their surfaces.</description>

      <title>No dilute core produced in simulations of giant impacts on to Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A giant impact has been proposed as a possible formation mechanism for Jupiter's dilute core -- the planet's inferred internal structure in which the transition between its core of heavy elements and its predominantly hydrogen-helium envelope is gradual rather than a discrete interface. A past simulation suggested that a head-on impact of a $10~M_\oplus$ planet into an almost fully formed, differentiated Jupiter could lead to a post-impact planet with a smooth compositional gradient and a central heavy-element fraction as low as $Z\approx0.5$. Here, we present simulations of giant impacts on to Jupiter using improved numerical methods to reassess the feasibility of this scenario. We use the REMIX smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation, which has been newly developed to improve the treatment of mixing in SPH simulations. We note that, as in previous works, chemical mixing is not included in these models and that incorporating such processes at sub-particle scales could improve numerical convergence. We perform giant impact simulations with varying speeds, angles, pre-impact planet structures, and equations of state. In all of our simulations, heavy elements re-settle over short time-scales to form a differentiated core, even in cases where the core is initially disrupted into a transiently mixed state. A dilute core is not produced in any of our simulations. These results, combined with recent observations that indicate Saturn also has a dilute core, suggest that such structures are produced as part of the extended formation and evolution of giant planets, rather than through extreme, low-likelihood giant impacts.</description>

      <title>Thermal Inertia Controls on Titan's Surface Temperature and Planetary Boundary Layer Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding Titan's planetary boundary layer (PBL)-the lowest region of the atmosphere influenced by surface conditions-remains challenging due to Titan's thick atmosphere and limited observations. Previous modeling studies have produced inconsistent estimates of surface temperature variability, a critical determinant of PBL behavior, often without clear explanations grounded in surface energy balance. Here, we develop a theoretical framework and apply a three-dimensional dry general circulation model (GCM) to investigate how surface thermal inertia influences surface energy balance and temperature variability across diurnal and seasonal timescales. At diurnal timescales, lower thermal inertia surfaces experience larger temperature fluctuations and enhanced daytime sensible heat fluxes due to less efficient subsurface heat conduction. In contrast, at seasonal timescales, surface temperature variations show weak sensitivity to thermal inertia, as atmospheric damping tends to dominate over subsurface conduction. The PBL depth ranges from a few hundred meters to 1,000m on diurnal timescales, while seasonal maxima reach 2,000m, supporting the interpretation from a previous study that the Huygens probe captured the two PBL structures. Simulated seasonal winds at the Huygens landing site successfully reproduce key observed features, including near-surface retrograde winds and meridional wind reversals within the lowest few kilometers, consistent with Titan's cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. Simulations for the planned Dragonfly landing site predict shallower thermal PBLs with smaller fluctuation amplitudes, while maintaining similar wind patterns. This work establishes a physically grounded framework for understanding Titan's surface temperature and boundary layer variability, and offers a unified explanation of Titan's PBL behavior that provides improved guidance for future missions.</description>

      <title>A dark matter hail: Detecting macroscopic dark matter with asteroids, planetary rings, and craters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.</description>
