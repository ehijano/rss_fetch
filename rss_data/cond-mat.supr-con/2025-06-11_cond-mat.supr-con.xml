      <title>Ising superconductivity in bulk layered non-centrosymmetric 4H-NbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit multiple polymorphs that enable the exploration of diverse quantum states, including valley-selective spin polarization, the valley Hall effect, Ising superconductivity, and nontrivial topology. Monolayer 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ is a promising candidate for realizing Ising superconductivity due to its spin-split, out-of-plane spin-polarized states arising from inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In contrast, bulk 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ retains inversion symmetry and lacks spin splitting, limiting its suitability for hosting Ising superconductivity. Here, we report the growth of high-quality single crystals of the acentric bulk superconducting polymorph, 4$H$-NbSe$_2$, which intrinsically breaks the inversion symmetry and supports valley-selective spin-polarized states. Magnetization and resistivity measurements reveal anisotropic superconductivity, with the in-plane upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit, while out-of-plane fields suppress superconductivity more rapidly, before reaching the Pauli limit, which strongly suggests the presence of Ising pairing. First-principles calculations and symmetry analysis confirm significant valley-selective spin splitting with out-of-plane spin polarization, further supporting the emergence of Ising superconductivity in 4$H$-NbSe$_2$. These results establish 4$H$-NbSe$_2$ as a robust bulk platform to investigate Ising superconductivity and valley-selective phenomena in transition-metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced suppression of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing symmetry of superconducting infinite-layer nickelates is a fundamental yet experimentally challenging question. We employ high-energy electron irradiation to induce disorder in superconducting Nd$_{0.825}$Sr$_{0.175}$NiO$_2$ thin films and examine the impact of pair-breaking defects on superconductivity and elucidate the nature of the superconducting gap. Our measurements reveal a complete suppression of superconductivity with increasing disorder, suggesting an unconventional, sign-changing order parameter.</description>

      <title>Emergent anisotropic three-phase order in critically doped superconducting diamond films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two decades since its discovery, superconducting heavily boron-doped diamond (HBDD) still presents unresolved fundamental questions whose resolution is relevant to the development of this material for quantum technologies. We use electrical magnetotransport measurements of critically-doped homoepitaxial single crystal HBDD films to reveal signatures of intrinsic (electronic) granular superconductivity. By studying the dependence of electrical resistivity on temperature and magnetic field vector, we infer that this granularity arises from electron correlations. This is revealed by a striking three-phase anisotropy in the magnetoresistance, accompanied by a spontaneous transverse voltage (Hall anomaly). Our findings indicate an emergent magnetically tunable intrinsic order in an otherwise isotropic three dimensional single crystal HBDD film, offering new insights into the mechanism of superconductivity in this quantum material.</description>

      <title>Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We Trotterize the mean-field dynamics of the integrable BCS model using symplectic integrators. The resulting chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large $\tau$ limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Unusual electron correlations in Kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A= K, Rb, Cs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in Kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While $KV_3Sb_5$ and $RbV_3Sb_5$ exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, $CsV_3Sb_5$ manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in $CsV_3Sb_5$ at low pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical analysis on the effects of an external Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit interactions on superconductivity. We have extensively studied their influence on the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the quasiparticle excitation energy. Our investigation includes a detailed examination of both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave pairing states. Implications for the recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb and Cs), as well as the validation of our theory have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows steplike features on the resistance under magnetic fields. These resistance steps are resulted from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the superconducting proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, show an unusual dependence on the magnitude of the uniaxial strain ($\epsilon$), indicating their connection with surface states. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal $\rightarrow$ strong topological insulator $\rightarrow$ trivial insulator, and supports the presence of surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 0.85\%$.</description>

      <title>Phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics of the polar charge density wave phase of the superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality. We show the phononic signatures of the charge density wave transition at $T^*$ = 155\,K in Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. The detailed temperature dependence of these phonon modes' frequency, half width at half maximum, and integrated area below $T^*$ reveal anomalies at an intermediate temperature $T' \sim$ 100\,K, especially for the low-energy modes at 130 and 180\,\cm-1. We discuss the origin of these phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of Mo$_3$Al$_2$C.</description>

      <title>Realizing high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular-hydrogen through Li doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore lithium-doped stable molecular hydrogen structures by performing first-principles crystal structure searches across varying compositions in the Li-H system under high pressure. Our search reveals a cubic phase of LiH12, which shows promise as a high-temperature superconductor. Our Bader charge analysis suggests that electron transfer from Li to H atoms tunes the intra- and inter-molecular H-H distances, which are critical for the metallization of molecular hydrogen. This modulation alters the interaction between bonding and anti-bonding 1s states of hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, Li ions serve as stabilizers for the distorted H2 molecular network through ionic interactions. Numerical solutions to the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations reveals that this phase could exhibit superconductivity above 300 K at a pressure of 250 GPa, a pressure value that is typically achievable using a diamond anvil cell. Detailed analysis of species-specific phonons and the Eliashberg function shows that low- and intermediate-energy phonons are crucial in promoting strong electron-phonon coupling. Thus, our study establishes lithium doping as a promising approach to induce high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular hydrogen without causing molecular dissociation.</description>

      <title>Scattering and Pairing by Exchange Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum interactions exchanging different types of particles play a pivotal r\^{o}le in quantum many-body theory, but they are not sufficiently investigated from a mathematical perspective. Here, we consider a system made of two fermions and one boson, in order to study the effect of such an off-diagonal interaction term, having in mind the physics of cuprate superconductors. Additionally, our model also includes a generalized Hubbard interaction (i.e., a general local repulsion term for the fermions). Regarding pairing, exponentially localized dressed bound fermion pairs are shown to exist and their effective dispersion relation is studied in detail. Scattering properties of the system are derived for two channels: the unbound and bound pair channels. We give particular attention to the regime of very large on-site (Hubbard) repulsions, because this situation is relevant for cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.</description>
