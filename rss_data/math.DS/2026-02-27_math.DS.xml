      <title>Ramanujan subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite, connected, $(d+1)$-regular graph $G$ is called Ramanujan if every its eigenvalue $\lambda$ satisfies either $\lambda=\pm (d+1)$ or $|\lambda|\leq 2\sqrt{d}$. The Ramanujan condition corresponds to the optimal rate of decay of correlations for the associated non-backtracking edge subshift. We consider a higher-dimensional generalization of this observation. We introduce the notion of a $d$-regular $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift of finite type, and we define a Ramanujan subshift as a $d$-regular $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift with an optimal rate of decay of correlations. We show that for every odd prime power $q\geq 3$ and dimension $\delta&lt;q$, there exists a $q$-regular Ramanujan $\mathbb{Z}^{\delta}$-subshift. The construction is based on the quaternionic lattices over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ introduced by Rungtanapirom-Stix-Vdovina (2019). Each of our $q$-regular Ramanujan subshifts gives rise to a family of non-bipartite $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs. These graphs are very explicit and local in the strong sense: the neighbors of any vertex can be computed by an explicit Mealy automaton associated with the subshift. As a byproduct, for every odd prime power $q$, we get a single lifting rule that can be iterated to produce an infinite family of $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs.</description>

      <title>Center Conditions and Cyclicity for Generic Planar Polynomial Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the center-focus problem for planar polynomial vector fields, which can be viewed as a local version of Hilbert's 16th problem. Based on a Lyapunov function approach, we establish novel results regarding the center-focus conditions. More precisely, under generic conditions, and for any degree of a polynomial vector field, we find an upper bound on the size of the Bautin ideal generated by the Lyapunov constants. This also provides an upper bound on the cyclicity of the systems we consider.</description>

      <title>Anchoring and Mixed-Norm Contractions in Averaging-Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single informed agent can draw an arbitrarily large network to the ground truth. This is the sharpest consequence of the "Averaging plus Learning" framework studied here, where agents update opinions by socially averaging neighbours while some receive private feedback at heterogeneous rates. The key is a graph-theoretic property we call condensely anchored, which implies convergence to the correct consensus on fixed networks. In the original framework of Popescu and Vaidya (2023), every agent was required to learn. Removing that requirement changes the problem fundamentally: the underlying graph must now carry the signal from a handful of anchors to everyone else. When learning rates decay to zero, a persistence condition on the rates alone suffices, with no uniform connectivity or aperiodicity assumed. The hardest case is intermittent connectivity, where no single time step contracts in any standard norm. A mixed-operator-norm framework is developed that extracts two-step contraction from the interplay between aggregate learning mass and entrywise diffusion of influence, a mechanism new to consensus literature. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness: vanishing noise preserves convergence to the ground truth, whereas persistent noise drives the system to a limiting law.</description>

      <title>Topological entropy, mean dimension, and weakly equivalent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly revisit a nice theory for topological entropy of weakly equivalent flows, which was originally investigated by Ohno in 1980. We will develop a new approach, being more straightforward and elementary than the measure-theoretic one provided by Ohno, to the theory for weak equivalence of flows, and as a novelty, we study both topological entropy and mean dimension with a highly unified process in relation to such objects.
  In particular, for weakly equivalent flows without fixed points we recover Ohno's theorem for topological entropy relation with a substantially different method, and moreover, carry out an analogue within the framework of mean dimension; while for weakly equivalent flows with fixed points, our technique refines the procedure suggested in Ohno's construction, and strengthens Ohno's example with a view towards topological complexity of dynamical systems.
  Essentially, our method is topological. For this purpose, we first introduce a modification to the definition of topological entropy, by relating a spanning set inside the state space to a finite set outside, which comes to be a tiny but key difference, via a map, and further, show that it leads eventually to the same value as the topological entropy. Although to an intermediate extent, the modified quantity generally does not coincide with the one appearing in the classical definition, it has some basic combinatorial feature, which not only applies flexibly to topological entropy, but also adapts directly to the mean dimension context. Using this alternative, we are allowed to re-establish and enrich Ohno's theory.</description>

      <title>Resonant grazing bifurcations revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vibro-impact mechanics, the division between an impact and a near miss is a zero-velocity grazing event. Grazing bifurcations of stable periodic motions often produce complicated attractors when grazing generates a square-root term in the Poincar\'e map. This paper concerns codimension-two scenarios for which the square-root term vanishes in some iterate of the Poincar\'e map. For forced one-degree-of-freedom oscillators, this occurs when the forcing frequency is a certain rational multiple of the damped natural frequency, i.e., the system is in resonance. In two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, curves of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations of single-impact periodic motions emanate from the codimension-two points. In this paper we prove these curves are quadratically tangent to the curve of grazing bifurcations, and derive explicit formulas for their quadratic coefficients. This is achieved by modifying the Poincar\'e map in a way that circumvents the square-root singularity, enabling us to use the implicit function theorem to demonstrate smoothness and perform asymptotic calculations of the saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcation curves. In doing so we resolve a long-standing conjecture on the admissibility of single-impact periodic motions by supplementing raw asymptotic computations with geometric and topological arguments. We illustrate the results with a linear impact oscillator model, matching the theoretical unfolding to numerically computed bifurcation curves. The results explain why previously reported physical experiments reveal an absence of chaos shortly past the grazing bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Existence and characterization of attractors for a nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation having an energy functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonlocal reaction-diffusion equation in which the diffusion depends on the gradient of the solution. We prove first the existence and uniqueness of regular and strong solutions. Second, we obtain the existence of global attractors in both situations under rather weak assumptions by the defining a multivalued semiflow (which is a semigroup in the particular situation when uniqueness of the Cauchy problem is satisfied). Third, we characterize the attractor either as the unstable manifold of the set of stationary points or as the stable one when we consider solutions only in the set of bounded complete trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological dynamics, tame and null systems arise naturally in the study of low-complexity aperiodic behaviour, yet providing concrete and easily testable conditions to establish their existence in a canonical class of systems is often nontrivial. We give a complete characterisation of tameness and nullness for minimal automatic systems generated by primitive constant length substitutions in terms of amorphic complexity -- a numerical invariant recently introduced to study zero entropy systems. We derive an easily computable closed formula for this invariant in this setting and show that, for infinite automatic systems, tameness and nullness are equivalent to its value being one.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents for random products of non-negative matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first study i.i.d. products of finitely many invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices with positive entries, and prove that the top Lyapunov exponent admits an explicit, rapidly convergent Neumann-series-type representation involving an infinite matrix. We further show that non-negative invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices are simultaneously conjugate to positive matrices if and only if ``generalized'' heteroclinic connections do not occur among products of length at most $2$.
  These results yield a series formula for the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of the middle-$n$th Cantor set with a random translate of itself, for every natural number $n$ except $4$. Furthermore, our method applies to the intersection of thick Cantor sets under random translation. We also determine the almost sure growth rate of i.i.d. three-term recurrences with finitely many positive coefficients.</description>

      <title>Quadratization of Autonomous Partial Differential Equations: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadratization for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a process that transforms a nonquadratic PDE into a quadratic form by introducing auxiliary variables. This symbolic transformation has been used in diverse fields to simplify the analysis, simulation, and control of nonlinear and nonquadratic PDE models. This paper presents a rigorous definition of PDE quadratization, theoretical results for the PDE quadratization problem of spatially one-dimensional PDEs-including results on existence and complexity-and introduces QuPDE, an algorithm based on symbolic computation and discrete optimization that outputs a quadratization for any spatially one-dimensional polynomial or rational PDE. This algorithm is the first computational tool to find quadratizations for PDEs to date. We demonstrate QuPDE's performance by applying it to fourteen nonquadratic PDEs in diverse areas such as fluid mechanics, space physics, chemical engineering, and biological processes. QuPDE delivers a low-order quadratization in each case, uncovering quadratic transformations with fewer auxiliary variables than those previously discovered in the literature for some examples, and finding quadratizations for systems that had not been transformed to quadratic form before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical concept is identified and analyzed that is implicit in the 2012 paper Turing Incomputable Computation, presented at the Alan Turing Centenary Conference (Turing 100, Manchester). The concept, called dynamic level sets, is distinct from mathematical concepts in the standard literature on dynamical systems, topology, and computability theory. A new mathematical object is explained and why it may have escaped prior characterizations, including the classical result of de Leeuw, Moore, Shannon, and Shapiro (1956) that probabilistic Turing machines compute no more than deterministic ones.</description>

      <title>A class of bilateral weighted shift operators, and linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to initiate a study of bilateral weighted backward shift operators defined on the spaces $\ell^p_{a,b}(\Omega_{r,R})$ and $c_{0,a,b}(\Omega_{r,R})$ which are Banach spaces of analytic functions on a suitable annulus in the complex plane, having a normalized Schauder basis of the form, $$ f_n(z):= (a_n+b_{n}z)z^{n},\hskip 0.5cm n\in \mathbb{Z}. $$ We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a weighted shift $B_w$ to be bounded, and find conditions so that $B_w$ is similar to a compact perturbation of a weighted shift on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. In addition, we study when $B_w$ is hypercyclic, supercyclic, and chaotic. It shown that the zero-one law of orbital limit points does not hold for $B_w$, which is in contrast to the case of weighted shifts on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. Most of our results are obtained using the matrix form of $B_w$.</description>

      <title>Local Invariant Structures in the Dynamics of Capillary Water Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical experiments show that a capillary water jet is exponentially unstable under long-wave perturbations, while remaining stable under short-wave perturbations. Measurements further indicate that the exponential growth rate in the long-wave regime agrees quantitatively with the classical predictions of Rayleigh and Plateau. This phenomenon is known as the \emph{Rayleigh-Plateau instability}. In this paper, we provide a mathematical justification of these experimental observations. The motion of the water jet is modeled by an irrotational Eulerian free-boundary system governed by surface tension. We prove that the (un)stable directions in the linearized system, corresponding to long-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to an (un)stable invariant manifold of the full nonlinear system. On the other hand, the elliptic directions, corresponding to short-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to a center invariant set in a generalized sense. These results give a positive answer to the question raised by Lin-Zeng concerning the existence of invariant manifolds for Eulerian free-boundary systems. The major methodological contribution is the construction of ``paradifferential propagator" corresponding to linear paradifferential hyperbolic systems along elliptic directions, making Lyapunov-Perron type arguments applicable. The method effectively balances the loss of regularity in quasilinear problems and can be generalized to a broader class of PDEs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Differential Inclusions driven by Maximal Monotone Operators with empty interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the long-time behavior of stochastic differential inclusions driven by maximal monotone operators, motivated by continuous-time models of first-order optimization methods under noisy or approximate operator information. We first address well-posedness and show that existence and uniqueness can be established without the customary requirement that the operator's domain has nonempty interior, by adopting an appropriate notion of solution. We then analyze asymptotic properties of the resulting stochastic dynamics, extending convergence guarantees beyond previously studied settings that rely on smooth potentials, full-domain subdifferentials, or Lipschitz monotone operators. In addition, we consider a Tikhonov-type regularization of the stochastic inclusion and prove corresponding well-posedness and long-time convergence results.</description>

      <title>SODAs: Sparse Optimization for the Discovery of Differential and Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) integrate ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with algebraic constraints, providing a fundamental framework for developing models of dynamical systems characterized by timescale separation, conservation laws, and physical constraints. While sparse optimization has revolutionized model development by allowing data-driven discovery of parsimonious models from a library of possible equations, existing approaches for dynamical systems assume DAEs can be reduced to ODEs by eliminating variables before model discovery. This assumption limits the applicability of such methods for DAE systems with unknown constraints and time scales. We introduce Sparse Optimization for Differential-Algebraic Systems (SODAs), a data-driven method for the identification of DAEs in their explicit form. By discovering the algebraic and dynamic components sequentially without prior identification of the algebraic variables, this approach leads to a sequence of convex optimization problems. It has the advantage of discovering interpretable models that preserve the structure of the underlying physical system. To this end, SODAs improves numerical stability when handling high correlations between library terms, caused by near-perfect algebraic relationships, by iteratively refining the conditioning of the candidate library. We demonstrate the performance of our method on biological, mechanical, and electrical systems, showcasing its robustness to noise in both simulated time series and real-time experimental data.</description>

      <title>Polynomially effective equidistribution for certain unipotent subgroups in quotients of perfect Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an effective equidistribution theorem for orbits of certain unipotent subgroups in arithmetic quotients of perfect Lie groups with a polynomial error term. Even for semisimple quotients, our result provides the first infinite family of examples where effective equidistribution with polynomial error rate is obtained for non-horospherical unipotent subgroups.
  The proof is based on the spectral gap of the ambient space, an effective closing lemma, Bourgain's discretized projection theorem, and a sub-modularity inequality in irreducible representation. The sub-modularity inequality is crucial to our proof and is of independent interest.
  As applications, we obtain effective estimates on distribution of lattice orbits on homogeneous spaces, as well as an effective version of the Oppenheim conjecture for indefinite quadratic forms with a polynomial error rate in all dimension $d \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>On the Collatz Conjecture: Topological and Ergodic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Collatz function famously related to the Collatz Conjecture under the topological and ergodic perpectives, including an approach with thermodynamic formalism. By introducing a key topology and its Borel sigma-algebra we show that recurrence implies periodicity. Moreover, we establish that the set of periodic orbits is finite if, and only if, every continuous potential possesses some equilibrium state. The uniqueness of periodic orbits is equivalent to the uniqueness of equilibrium state for every bounded and continuous potential. Additionaly, by using the Alexandroff compactification of the established topology, we prove finiteness of cycles, which is a significant advance to the conjecture itself. Finally, we apply our technique to the Baker and Syracuse maps, obtaining a similar result for a general class of important maps.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the dimension spectrum for continued fraction expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the dimension spectrum of continued fractions expansions with coefficients restricted to infinite subsets of $ \mathbb{N}$. We prove that the set of powers $P_q=\{q^n\colon n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ has full dimension spectrum for each integer $q\geq 2$, answering a question by Chousionis, Leykekhman and Urba\'nski. On the other hand, we show that the dimension spectrum for $P^*_q=\{q^n\colon n\in \mathbb{N}\}\cup\{1\}$ has many gaps and regions where it is nowhere dense. We also investigate the case where $A$ is generated by a monomial, $M_q=\{n^q\colon n\in\mathbb{N}\}$. For $M_q$ we prove that the dimension spectrum is full for $q\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and it has a gap for each $q\geq 6$. Furthermore we show for $q\in\{6,7,8\}$ that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ is the disjoint union of two nontrivial closed intervals, and it is the disjoint union of three nontrivial closed intervals for $q \in\{9,10\}$. For $q\geq 11$ we show that the dimension spectrum of $M_q$ consists of finitely many disjoint nontrivial closed intervals. The results concerning $M_q$ extend existing results for $q=1$ and $q=2$. In our analysis we employ Perron-Frobenius (transfer) operators, and numerical tools developed by Falk and Nussbaum that give rigorous estimates for the Hausdorff dimension for continued fractions expansions.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Probabilistic Forecasting of Dynamical Systems using Flow Matching and Physical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems from incomplete or noisy data is inherently ill-posed, as a single observation may correspond to multiple plausible futures. While physics-based ensemble forecasting relies on perturbing initial states to capture uncertainty, standard Gaussian or uniform perturbations often yield unphysical initial states in high-dimensional systems. Existing machine learning approaches address this via diffusion models, which rely on inference via computationally expensive stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We introduce a novel framework that decouples perturbation generation from propagation. First, we propose a flow matching-based generative approach to learn physically consistent perturbations of the initial conditions, avoiding artifacts caused by Gaussian noise. Second, we employ deterministic flow matching models with Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) integrators for efficient ensemble propagation with fewer integration steps. We validate our method on nonlinear dynamical system benchmarks, including the Lotka-Volterra Predator-Prey system, MovingMNIST, and high-dimensional WeatherBench data (5.625$^\circ$). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic scoring, as measured by the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), and physical consistency, while offering significantly faster inference than diffusion-based baselines.</description>

      <title>On the order of lazy cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the most elementary family of cellular automata defined over an arbitrary group universe $G$ and an alphabet $A$: the lazy cellular automata, which act as the identity on configurations in $A^G$, except when they read a unique active transition $p \in A^S$, in which case they write a fixed symbol $a \in A$. As expected, the dynamical behavior of lazy cellular automata is relatively simple, yet subtle questions arise since they completely depend on the choice of $p$ and $a$. In this paper, we investigate the order of a lazy cellular automaton $\tau : A^G \to A^G$, defined as the cardinality of the set $\{ \tau^k : k \in \mathbb{N} \}$. In particular, we establish a general upper bound for the order of $\tau$ in terms of the fibers of $p$, and we prove that this bound is attained when $p$ is a quasi-constant pattern.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hausdorff dimension of irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized Hausdorff dimension of some natural subsets of $k^{-1}(3)$, where $k^{-1}(3)$ consists of the real numbers $x$ for which $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{(3+\varepsilon)q^2}$ has infinitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ for any $\varepsilon&lt;0$ but only finitely many for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$. It is well known that $k^{-1}(3)$ is an uncountable set with Hausdorff dimension zero. Given any dimension function $h$, we determine the exact "cut point" at which the generalized Hausdorff dimension $\mathcal{H}^h(k^{-1}(3))$ drops from infinity to zero. In particular we show that such a measure is always zero or not $\sigma$--finite, and, as an application, we can classify topologically $k^{-1}(3)$. Moreover, we show that the subset of attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has the same generalized Hausdorff dimension as $k^{-1}(3)$, but the subset of non--attainable elements of $k^{-1}(3)$ has a "strictly smaller" generalized Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and asymptotic limits for Langevin interacting systems with singular forces and multiplicative noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04974v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study systems of $N$ interacting particles described by the classical and relativistic Langevin dynamics with singular forces and multiplicative noises. For the classical model, we prove the ergodicity, obtaining an exponential rate of convergence to the invariant Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution, and the small-mass limit, recovering the $N$-particle interacting overdamped Langevin dynamics. For the relativistic model, we establish the ergodicity, obtaining an algebraic mixing rate of any order to the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution, and the Newtonian limit (that is when the speed of light tends to infinity), approximating a system of underdamped Langevin dynamics. The proofs rely on the construction of Lyapunov functions that account for irregular potentials and multiplicative noises.</description>
