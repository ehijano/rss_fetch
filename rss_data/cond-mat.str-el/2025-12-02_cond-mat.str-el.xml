      <title>Exploring the apparent violation of the Mott relation in a noncentrosymmetric kagome ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic topological materials, time-reversal symmetry breaking gives rise to topological point and line nodes with distinctive signatures in the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivity that satisfy the well-known Mott relation. However, this relationship can fail for doping-dependent transport measurements of materials with complex magnetism, topology, and electronic correlations. In this work, we present transport measurements of the correlated topological metal UCoAl doped with Ru, which appear to violate the Mott relation. We develop a model that captures the evolution of Stoner magnetism and topological Weyl points as a function of doping. Using this model, we show how the correlated flat band in this material pins the Weyl points to the Fermi energy, and demonstrate how this explains the unusual doping-dependent behavior of the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst conductivities in this material, while the Mott relation is in fact satisfied at each doping level.</description>

      <title>Robust semiclassical magnetization plateau in the kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent observations of the $1/3$ magnetization plateau in kagome-based magnets, we investigate the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice under the influence of an external magnetic field. Although the classical ground state at zero field depends on the sign of $J_2$, we find a robust $1/3$ semiclassical magnetization plateau in both cases. The mechanism that stabilizes this plateau is analogous to that observed in the triangular lattice, where quantum fluctuations select a collinear state from the degenerate classical manifold. We calculate the plateau width, which shows a weak dependence on $J_2$, using nonlinear spin-wave theory. Additionally, we find that a straightforward approach based on linear spin-wave yields quantitatively accurate results even for $S=1/2$. Furthermore, we identify a magnetization jump at the saturation field when $J_2=0$; this jump is related to the presence of a flat band and disappears for $J_2 \neq 0$. Our study demonstrates that a semiclassical approach effectively captures the $1/3$ plateau in the kagome lattice and serves as a valuable tool for interpreting experimental and numerical results alike.</description>

      <title>Magnetosynthesis effect on the structure and ground state of Cu$^{2+}$-based antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subtle synthetic variables can have an outsizes influence on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of a material, particularly those of quantum materials. In this work, we investigate the impact of synthesis under a magnetic field (magnetosynthesis) on the crystal structure and magnetic properties of several Cu$^{2+}$ ($S=1/2$) based materials with antiferromagnetic interactions and varying levels of magnetic frustration, from simple antiferromagnets to a quantum spin liquid. We employ small (0.09 - 0.37 T) magnetic fields applied during low-temperature hydrothermal or evaporative synthesis of the simple antiferromagnet CuCl$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the canted antiferromagnet (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O, the frustrated and canted antiferromagnet atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl, and the highly frustrated quantum spin liquid herbertsmithite Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$. We found that (Cu,Zn)$_3$Cl$_4$(OH)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O experiences structural changes well above its magnetic transition. Atacamite Cu$_2$(OH)$_3$Cl synthesized under a 0.19 T field experiences a 0.15 K (~3%) decrease in its N\'eel transition temperature and a significant strengthening of its antiferromagnetic interactions, suggesting that magnetosynthesis can influence the ground state of moderately frustrated materials.</description>

      <title>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic boosting of chiral phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality characterizes the asymmetry between a structure and its mirror image and underlies a wide range of chiral functionalities. In crystallographically chiral materials, phonons with non-zero linear momentum $\textbf{k}$ can acquire a $k$-induced longitudinal magnetization, giving rise to chiral phonons. Helical spin order, with its proper screw-type configuration, breaks all mirror symmetries and therefore carries magnetic chirality. Such helical spins also generate non-relativistic spin splitting for any quasiparticle excitations propagating along the screw axis. To explore the possible connection between chiral phonons and magnetic chirality, we investigated the crystallographically polar and chiral compound (Mn,Ni)$_3$TeO$_6$, which hosts three distinct states: a paramagnetic state, a helical spin state with magnetic chirality, and a collinear spin state without magnetic chirality. We find an approximately tenfold enhancement of chiral-phonon coupling in the helical spin state along the screw axis, compared with both the paramagnetic and collinear spin states. These results identify a new route to amplify chiral phonons through an altermagnetic effect arising from the broken parity-time symmetry in helical spins. %from non-relativistic spin splitting.</description>

      <title>Near-flat-band-driven violation of Pauli limit in heavy fermion superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-fermion superconductors often display upper critical fields that exceed the conventional Pauli paramagnetic limit, indicating that strong correlations and hybridized quasiparticle bands play an essential role in the paramagnetic pair-breaking process. Within the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model, we perform a self-consistent mean-field analysis of spin-singlet s-, extended-s-, and d-wave pairing under Zeeman fields, and compute the critical field Bc, the transition temperature Tc, and the Clogston-Chandrasekhar ratio rCC. We find that rCC increases sharply as the conduction filling approaches half filling. This enhancement arises from the weakly dispersive region of the lower hybridized band, where the strongly reduced Fermi velocity diminishes the normal-state paramagnetic energy and stabilizes superconductivity. At fixed filling, the distinct JH dependences among the three pairing channels reflect the sensitivity of Pauli limiting to both band curvature and the structure of the order parameter. These results provide microscopic evidence that proximity to a near-flat hybridized band offers a robust route to enhanced Pauli-limiting fields in heavy-fermion superconductors.</description>

      <title>Dressing composite fermions with artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent variational studies have demonstrated that the strongly correlated ground states of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect can be captured using machine learning approaches starting from no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We introduce a complementary framework that instead starts from Jain's composite-fermion (CF) wavefunctions, which accurately describe FQH states as weakly interacting states of CFs at fillings $\nu = n/(2pn+1)$ in an idealized limit. As we move away from this idealized limit to one more in line with experimental reality, we expect CFs to become dressed much like the electrons of a noninteracting system, which are dressed by neutral excitations as interaction is turned on adiabatically, as in Landau's Fermi-liquid theory. We model this dressing using a Feynman-Cohen-style backflow approach, implemented through symmetry-preserving neural networks-a framework we refer to as CF-Flow. CF-Flow achieves competitive accuracy with substantially greater computational efficiency and scales to systems of $\gtrsim 26$ electrons. At fillings $\nu = 1/3$ and $2/5$, as a function of Landau-level mixing strength, CF-Flow produces ground-state energies with low local-energy variance that are nearly indistinguishable from those obtained using the fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo (fp-DMC) method, even though the latter constrains the wavefunction phase to that of the lowest Landau level-thereby providing insight into why fp-DMC has been successful in giving an accurate quantitative account of several experiments. Finally, the symmetry-preserving architecture of CF-Flow enables access to excited states and computation of the transport gap at $\nu = 1/3$, where we find, unexpectedly, that it decays exponentially toward a finite value in the limit of large Landau-level mixing, suggesting a first-order transition from the FQH liquid to a non-FQH state.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved Mott crossover and entanglement in the half-filled Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction-driven crossover from a correlated metallic state to Mott-insulating state on the half-filled 3x3 square cluster using exact diagonalization in the S=1/2 and S=3/2 sectors. Using complementary diagnostics such as order parameters, principal component analysis (PCA) of correlation matrices and quantum geometry, we obtain a unified, data-driven characterization of the crossover. All three diagnostics consistently identify a broad crossover centered in the weak-to-intermediate coupling regime U~2-6; charge gaps open rapidly, double occupancy suppresses, local moments form, entanglement is significantly reduced, PCA concentrates variance into a few dominant modes and the distance matrices reveals rapid wavefunction reorganization. Our multi-pronged approach establishes the Mott crossover as a smooth but well defined reorganization of electronic correlations with pronounced spin-sector dependence in finite systems.</description>

      <title>Bi-altermagnetism unveiled by sublattice-specific circular dichroism in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An altermagnet is a recently identified class of magnets that exhibit a zero net magnetic moment but break symmetry under the combined operations of parity and time reversal. It typically consists of two magnetic sites of opposite spins related by rotation within the unit cell. Here, we use circular dichroism (CD) in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to identify a new form of altermagnetism, namely bi-altermagnetism, in the correlated insulator Fe2Mo3O8, which comprises two altermagnetic sublattices: one with alternating quasi-octahedral Fe environments and the other with alternating tetrahedral Fe environments. We experimentally revealed the emergence of CD in an achiral, zero-magnetization system, thereby probing mirror-symmetry breaking associated with altermagnetic order. Notably, the CD appeared at sublattice-specific excitations of the octahedral and tetrahedral sites, indicating symmetry breaking in both altermagnetic sublattices. Calculations based on a model with the bi-altermagnetic order along the c axis successfully reproduce the observed CD. Our findings provide compelling evidence for bi-altermagnetism in Fe2Mo3O8, and showcase the use of RIXS-CD as a probe of magnetic sublattices in systems with zero net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Evidence for itinerant electron-local moment interaction in Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use inelastic neutron scattering to study the impact of Li doping on the semiconducting altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe. Introducing Li results in a spin reorientation from in-plane to out-of-plane and increases the density of itinerant carriers. While the spin waves in Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe remain largely Heisenberg-like, there is significant spin wave broadening across the entire Brillouin zone, signaling enhanced magnon damping induced by itinerant carriers. By extracting the local dynamic susceptibility and applying the total moment sum rule, we find that both undoped and Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe exhibit the full expected Mn$^{2+}$ local moment of $\approx5.9~\mu_\mathrm{B}$ with $S=5/2$. These results demonstrate that Li-doped $\alpha$-MnTe hosts robust local-moment magnetism whose interactions are mediated via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type interactions, highlighting the importance of itinerant carriers in magneto-transport and spin dynamic properties of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Electric-field driven flat bands in the distorted sawtooth chain via the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate flat magnonic bands in a generalized sawtooth-chain
  model in which three sets of exchange parameters (symmetric
  Heisenberg exchange, axial Ising anisotropy, and antisymmetric
  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange) are assigned independently to
  each side of the triangular plaquette. If the effective
  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction parameters are generated
  via the Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (KNB) mechanism of
  magnetoelectricity, they become explicit functions of the
  electric-field magnitude and direction, as well as of the lattice
  geometry, which in the present casen is characterized by two bond
  angles. We focus on the situation in which these two angles are
  unequal, corresponding to a distortion of the triangular
  plaquette. Several electric-field induced flat-band scenarios in
  the distorted sawtooth chain are analyzed, and expressions are
  derived for the electric-field strength required to drive the
  one-magnon excitations into a flat-band regime when the field is
  aligned along the lattice bonds. The saturation field and its
  dependence on the distortion angle are also examined. Finally, we
  establish a mapping between the flat-band solutions for a general
  DM interaction and its specific KNB-induced form.

      <title>Magnetic clusters in the paramagnetic phase of a high-temperature ferromagnetic metal-organic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their exceptional chemical and electronic tunability, metal-organic frameworks can be designed to develop magnetic ground states making a range of applications feasible, from magnetic gas separation to the implementation of lightweight, rare-earth free permanent magnets. However, the typically weak exchange interactions mediated by the diamagnetic organic ligands result in ordering temperatures confined to the cryogenic limit. The itinerant magnetic ground state realized in the chromium-based framework Cr(tri)$_{2}$(CF$_{3}$SO$_{3}$)$_{0.33}$ (Htri, $1H$-$1$,$2$,$3$-triazole) is a remarkable exception to this trend, showing a robust ferromagnetic behavior almost at ambient conditions. Here, we use dc SQUID magnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and ferromagnetic resonance to study the magnetic state realized in this material. We highlight several thermally-activated relaxation mechanisms for the nuclear magnetization due to the tendency of electrons towards localization at low temperatures as well as the rotational dynamics of the charge-balancing triflate ions confined within the pores. Most interestingly, we report the development within the paramagnetic regime of mesoscopic magnetic correlated clusters whose slow dynamics in the MHz range are tracked by the nuclear moments, in agreement with the highly unconventional nature of the magnetic transition detected by dc SQUID magnetometry. We discuss the similarity between the clustered phase in the paramagnetic phase and the magnetoelectronic phase segregation leading to colossal magnetoresistance in manganites and cobaltites. These results demonstrate that high-temperature magnetic metal-organic frameworks can serve as a versatile platform for exploring correlated electron phenomena in low-density, chemically tunable materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of superconducting pairs in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency structure of the superconducting correlations in cuprates gives insights on the pairing mechanism. Here we present an exhaustive study of this problem in the two-dimensional Hubbard model with cellular dynamical mean-field theory. To this end, we systematically quantify the dependence on doping and interaction strength of the superconducting gap, of the frequency scales where pairing occurs, and of their relative contribution to pairing. We find pair-forming alternating with pair-breaking processes as a function of frequency, providing new evidence that pairing can arise in principle from both low- and high-frequency processes. However, we find that the high-frequency pair-forming processes are outweighed by pair-breaking ones. Hence, the net contribution to pairing comes only from the low-frequency pair-forming processes, a result that underscores their key role in the pairing mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic instability in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice. Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Disorder Suppression of Charge Density Wave in the Honeycomb Holstein Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of charge-density-wave order in Dirac fermion systems via electron-phonon coupling represents a significant topic in condensed matter physics. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the Holstein model on the honeycomb lattice, with a specific focus on the effect of disorder. While the interplay between electron-electron interactions and disorder has long been a central theme in the field, recent attention has increasingly turned to the combined influence of disorder and electron-phonon coupling. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we concentrate on the phase transitions of charge-density-wave order on the honeycomb lattice. Disorder is introduced through the random hopping of electrons in the system, which can localize electrons via the Anderson effect. Our primary result is that disorder suppresses the charge-density-wave phase, and the interplay between disorder and electron-phonon interactions extends the phase area. We also determine the transition temperature \(\beta_c\) to the ordered phase as a function of the electron-phonon coupling. Additionally, we observed a suppression of electron kinetic energy and dc conductivity under disorder, highlighting the role of Anderson localization in the degradation of electronic transport. These findings offer significant theoretical insight into the stability and critical phenomena of correlated phases in disordered two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ Vortex Crystal Candidate in the Triangular $S=1/2$ Quantum Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of merging the paradigms of geometric frustration on a triangular lattice and bond anisotropies in the strong spin-orbit coupling limit holds tremendous promise in the ongoing hunt for exotic quantum materials. Here we identify a new candidate system to realize such physics, the organic quantum antiferromagnet (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$. We report a combination of thermodynamic, magneto-elastic and neutron scattering experiments on single-crystals to determine the phase diagram in axial magnetic fields $\mathbf{H \parallel c}$ and propose a minimal model Hamiltonian. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ displays an ideal triangular arrangement of Ru$^{3+}$ ions adopting the spin-orbital entangled $j_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ state. It hosts residual magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 0.23$ K and a highly unusual $H-T$ phase diagram including three different incommensurate states. Spin-waves in the high-field polarized regime are well described by a Heisenberg-like triangular lattice Hamiltonian with a potential sub-leading bond dependent anisotropy term. We discuss possible candidate magnetic structures in the various observed phases and propose two mechanisms that could explain the field-dependent incommensurability, requiring either a small ferromagnetic Kitaev term or a tiny magneto-elastic $J-J'$ isosceles distortion driven by pseudospin-lattice coupling. We argue that the multi-$\mathbf{q}$ ground state in zero magnetic field is a prime candidate for hosting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal proposed on the triangular Heisenberg-Kitaev model. (CD$_3$ND$_3$)$_2$NaRuCl$_6$ is the first member in an extended family of quantum triangular lattice magnets, providing a new playground to study the interplay of geometric frustration and spin-orbit effects.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Eigenstates of a Doped Hole in the Ising Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-N\'eel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Refining Heuristic Predictors of Fractional Chern Insulators using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an interpretable, data-driven framework to quantify how single-particle band geometry governs the stability of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Using large-scale exact diagonalization, we evaluate an FCI metric that yields a continuous spectral measure of FCI stability across parameter space. We then train Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) -- a recently developed interpretable neural architecture -- to regress this metric from two band-geometric descriptors: the trace violation $T$ and the Berry curvature fluctuations $\sigma_B$. Applied to spinless fermions at filling $\nu=1/3$ in models on the checkerboard and kagome lattices, our approach yields compact analytical formulas that predict FCI stability with over $&gt;80 \%$ accuracy in both regression and classification tasks, and remain reliable even in data-scarce regimes. The learned relations reveal model-dependent trends, clarifying the limits of Landau-level-mimicking heuristics. Our framework provides a general method for extracting simple, phenomenological "laws" that connect many-body phase stability to chosen physical descriptors, enabling rapid hypothesis formation and targeted design of quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Heterometallic spin-1/2 quantum magnet under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of CuVOF$_4$(H$_2$O)$_6$$\cdot$H$_2$O, in which two different spin species, Cu(II) and V(IV), form antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 dimers with weak interdimer coupling provided via hydrogen bonding. Using radio-frequency susceptometry and electron-spin resonance (ESR), we show how the temperature-magnetic field spin-dimer phase diagram evolves as a function of applied hydrostatic pressure and correlate this with pressure-induced changes to the crystal structure. These results, coupled with pressure-tuned DFT calculations, confirm the prior prediction that the primary exchange interaction is mediated via an unusual mechanism in which the V(IV) ions provide considerable spin density to the oxygen that joins the two spins in each dimer and which lies along the Jahn-Teller axis of the Cu(II) ion. In addition, the dissimilarity in the spins that make up each dimer unit leads to a non-linear field dependence of the electronic energy levels as detected in the ESR measurements.</description>

      <title>Dual instability of superconductivity from oxygen defects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a dual mechanism by which oxygen defects suppress superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7+\delta}$ using density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory, and functional renormalization group analysis. Apical vacancies and interbilayer interstitials emerge as the dominant low-energy defect species and are further stabilized by orthorhombic domain walls. These two defect classes drive the electronic structure in opposing directions. Vacancy-induced disorder generates local magnetic moments and promotes Anderson localization at moderate concentrations, whereas periodic interstitial ordering yields a coherent but weakly correlated metallic background that fails to support superconductivity. These findings highlight the decisive role of oxygen defects in shaping the superconducting and provide microscopic guidance for improving superconductivity through controlled defect engineering.</description>

      <title>Classification of coherent peaks in two-terminal quantum devices into normal and anomalous Kondo peaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent peaks arising in the differential conductance of quantum dot (QD) and quantum point contact (QPC) devices are classified into two categories, normal and anomalous Kondo peaks, according to the underlying spin dynamics and the form of the scaling function to which the scaled temperature-dependent linear conductance collapses. The zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) observed in QPCs and in the triplet state of the even sector of quantum dot single-electron transistors (QDSETs) are identified as normal Kondo peaks, formed by spin dynamics involving spin exchange, a symbolic characteristic of the Kondo effect. For these ZBPs, the scaling temperature coincides with half the full width at half maximum (FWHM). In contrast, the ZBP observed in the odd sector of QDSETs and all finite-bias coherent peaks, including the coherent side peaks of QPCs and the split ZBP in the singlet state of the QDSET even sector, are identified as anomalous Kondo peaks, because they arise from spin dynamics without spin exchange, and their scaling temperature does not coincide with half the FWHM. To support these findings, we reproduce gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance line shapes measured in the odd sector of a QDSET, demonstrating that its ZBP originates from a combination of two coherent side peaks explicitly observed in QPCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth tritellurides ($R$Te$_3$) exhibit complex charge-density-wave (CDW) phases intertwined with lattice symmetry, offering a platform to explore unconventional symmetry breaking in correlated materials. Elasto-optical probing, which detects strain-induced changes in birefringence, provides a non-invasive approach to visualize anisotropy and emergent order in these quasi-two-dimensional systems. However, the magnitude and symmetry of the expected optical response remain poorly quantified, hindering experimental interpretation. Here, we perform first-principles calculations of the elastic, dielectric, and piezo-optical tensors of NdTe$_3$ to establish a quantitative framework for strain-induced optical anisotropy. These results establish a quantitative link between lattice strain and optical response in $R$Te$_3$, providing a predictive framework for probing symmetry-breaking states via elasto-birefringence.</description>

      <title>Helical Edge Transport in the \nu = 0 Quantum Hall Ferromagnetic State of an Organic Dirac Fermion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally confirm the \nu = 0 quantum Hall ferromagnetic (QHF) state, accompanied by helical edge states, in the layered organic Dirac-fermion system \alpha-(ET)2I3 by demonstrating helical edge transport in multilayers. The saturation of interlayer magnetoresistance (MR) in the high-magnetic-field quantum limit does not scale with the sample cross-sectional area and appears when the magnetic field is oriented along the side surface. The in-plane MR exhibits a similar angle dependence, whereas this feature disappears in the Corbino geometry where no edge channels are present. These results are consistent with helical edge transport in the multilayer QHF state. They also rule out the possibility that the observed angle-dependent MR arises from the chiral magnetic effect expected for a 3D Dirac or Weyl semimetal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets are characterized by anisotropic band/spin splittings in momentum space, dictated by their spin-space group symmetries. However, the real-space modulations of altermagnetism are often neglected and have not been explored experimentally. Here we combine neutron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), spin-resolved ARPES and density functional theory to demonstrate that Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O realizes a spatially modulated form of altermagnetism, i.e., hidden altermagnetism. Such a state in Cs$_{1-\delta}$V$_2$Te$_2$O results from its G-type antiferromagnetism and two-dimensional electronic states, allowing for the development of spatially alternating altermagnetic layers, whose local spin polarizations are directly verified by spin-resolved ARPES measurements. Our experimental discovery of hidden altermagnetism broadens the scope of unconventional magnetism and opens routes to exploring emergent phenomena from real-space modulations of altermagnetic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the classification of invertible translation-invariant stabilizer codes modulo condensation and stabilization with simple codes. We introduce generalizations of the Pauli groups of local unitaries for quantum systems of qudits on cubic lattices and analyze stabilizer Hamiltonians whose terms are chosen from these groups. We define invertible stabilizer codes to be ground states of stabilizer Hamiltonians with trivial topological charges and completely classify them in any spatial dimension in terms of relative L-theory groups. In particular, we show that the group of equivalence classes of such codes in three spatial dimensions is isomorphic to the Witt group of abelian topological orders in two spatial dimensions. Additionally, we propose the spectrum of the relative L-theory as a representative of the generalized cohomology theory corresponding to the invertible stabilizer states.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Geometry in the Competition between Higgs Mode and Quasiparticles in Third-Harmonic Generation of Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective modes in superconductors, such as the Higgs mode, offer deep insights into the nature of condensates. Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a primary tool for probing the Higgs mode, but its signal competes with that of quasiparticle excitations depending on impurity scattering rates. In particular, in the clean regime the standard BCS theory generally predicts the dominance of quasiparticle contributions. Here, we propose and demonstrate that the quantum geometry of electronic bands can be a key mechanism governing this competition. By developing a formalism that explicitly incorporates the quantum metric, and applying it to a tunable model of a dispersive-band superconductor, we show that the quantum metric can dramatically amplify the nonlinear light-Higgs coupling by several orders of magnitude. Our results establish that a large quantum metric can cause the Higgs mode to dominate the THG response, resolving the puzzle of Higgs and quasiparticle competition in the clean regime and identifying band geometry as a crucial ingredient for designing and understanding the nonlinear response of superconductors.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the spin-splitting in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, characterized by spin-split bands without net magnetization, have recently emerged as a promising platform for spintronics. However, their microscopic mechanisms remain elusive, often relying on abstract group theory. In this work, we present an intuitive and pedagogical framework to understand the origin of spin splitting in altermagnets. We identify two essential ingredients: (1) alternating spin-polarized wavefunction localization on sublattices, and (2) broken translational symmetry caused by distortions in non-magnetic ion cages. We discuss a minimal model Hamiltonian based on an atomic exchange-driven spin splitting and anisotropic hopping that captures these effects and reproduces the hallmark features of altermagnetic band structures, including nodal spin degeneracies and large spin splittings. Our model is further validated by ab initio calculations on MnF2. By demystifying the microscopic origins of altermagnetism, our work bridges symmetry analysis and material realizations, shedding light on practical designs of altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in optics and time-resolved techniques have facilitated the exploration of new states of matter under nonequilibrium conditions. Here, we predict that irradiated graphene can host two novel nonequilibrium steady states of matter with zero resistance when exposed to circularly polarized light: (i) Floquet Chern insulators and (ii) a radiation-induced zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution. Specifically, we calculate nonequilibrium anomalous Hall and longitudinal conductivities to map the nonequilibrium phase diagram of irradiated graphene as a function of the driving frequency and the electric-field strength of circularly polarized light. As a result, Floquet Chern insulators are found to occur at high driving frequencies above the graphene band width. By contrast, at low driving frequencies below the graphene band width, the nonequilibrium anomalous Hall conductivity deviates from the expected quantized values, and the nonequilibrium longitudinal conductivity exhibits highly irregular behavior, including negative resistance. It is predicted that the thermodynamically unstable negative resistance will trigger a catastrophic breakdown, inducing a zero-resistance state with spontaneous formation of an inhomogeneous current distribution, similar to the radiation-induced zero-resistance state observed in quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Fermi-liquid view of viscosity in cold and dense nucleon matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework to calculate transport properties in cold, dense relativistic quasiparticle system within the Fermi-liquid theory at the mean-field level. Building on our previous study [Phys. Rev. C 111, 044904 (2025)], we start from the linearized relativistic Boltzmann equation tailored to quasiparticles with medium-dependent dispersion relation and implement Landau matching conditions, proving that the bulk viscosity is manifestly nonnegative. A low-temperature expansion then yields leading-order ($T/\mu^*$) expressions for the shear ($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities, where the behavior $\zeta/\eta \propto (T/\mu^*)^4$ in the degenerate regime is found to be robust against quasiparticle mass correction. We couple the kinetic framework to a Walecka-type mean-field equation of state and compute $\eta$ and $\zeta$ for cold, dense nucleon matter. The transport properties of nucleonic matter in the degenerate regime can be relevant for intermediate beam-energy nuclear experiments.</description>

      <title>The effect of Coulomb interactions on relic neutrino detection via beta decaying impurities in (semi)metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the electron neutrino mass is a long-standing objective and requires a high energy resolution of certain $\beta$-decay experiments, as well as a visible cosmic neutrino background ($C{\nu}B$) spectrum. Many quantum mechanical and chemical effects could potentially impair the required resolution/visibility, e.g., the Coulomb interactions between the electrons in the \b{eta}-decaying impurity and in the solid-state environment. We analyze the effect when hybridization is suppressed completely using a dielectric spacer, and also when hybridization is present up to the lowest nontrivial order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically ordered states are among the most interesting quantum phases of matter that host emergent quasi-particles having fractional charge and obeying fractional quantum statistics. Theoretical study of such states is however challenging owing to their strong-coupling nature that prevents conventional mean-field treatment. Here, we demonstrate that an attention-based deep neural network provides an expressive variational wavefunction that discovers fractional Chern insulator ground states purely through energy minimization without prior knowledge and achieves remarkable accuracy. We introduce an efficient method to extract ground state topological degeneracy -- a hallmark of topological order -- from a single optimized real-space wavefunction in translation-invariant systems by decomposing it into different many-body momentum sectors. Our results establish neural network variational Monte Carlo as a versatile tool for discovering strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We explore the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) as a candidate for the ground state of the Mott insulating phase of fermions with six flavors on the Kagome lattice, particularly focusing on realizations using $^{173}$Yb atoms in optical lattices. Using mean-field theory and variational Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the Dirac spin liquid (DSL) has the lowest variational energy among SU(6) symmetry-preserving trial wave functions with a periodicity of a 12-site unit cell, as well as uniform chiral states with larger unit cells. It remains a local minimum even when small second-nearest neighbor and ring exchange interactions are introduced. To characterize the DSL, we calculate the static and dynamic structure factor of the Gutzwiller projected wavefunction and compare it with mean-field calculations. The static structure factor shows triangular-shaped plateaus around the $\mathrm{K}$ points in the extended Brillouin zone, with small peaks at the corners of these plateaus. The dynamical structure factor consists of a gapless continuum of fractionalized excitations. Our study also presents several complementary results, including bounds for the ground state energy, methods for calculating three-site ring exchange expectations in the projective mean field, the boundary of ferromagnetic states, and the non-topological nature of flat bands in the DSL band structure.</description>

      <title>A resonant valence bond spin liquid in the dilute limit of doped frustrated Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ideas about resonant valence bond liquids and spin-charge separation have led to key concepts in physics such as quantum spin liquids, emergent gauge symmetries, topological order, and fractionalisation. Despite extensive efforts to demonstrate the existence of a resonant valence bond phase in the Hubbard model that originally motivated the concept, a definitive realisation has yet to be achieved. Here we present a solution to this long-standing problem by uncovering a resonant valence bond phase exhibiting spin-charge separation in realistic Hamiltonians. We show analytically that this ground state emerges in the dilute-doping limit of a half-filled Mott insulator on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices with frustrated hopping, in the absence of exchange interactions. We confirm numerically that the results extend to finite exchange interactions, finite-sized systems and finite dopant density. Although much attention has been devoted to the emergence of unconventional states from geometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic energy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be essential for stabilising robust, topologically ordered states in real materials.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new method to construct simple and explicit variational approximations for the ground state of Kitaev's honeycomb model with a non-trivial Z2 flux configuration consisting of a pair of visons on neighbouring plaquettes. The method consists of retaining only the largest singular values of the generator of the transformation between the vison-pair and flux-free ground states. We compare physical quantities calculated using the approximate state to those obtained by extrapolating results of exact diagonalisation of finite lattices, finding them to be in very good agreement. We discuss ways to extend the method to more complicated flux configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the formation of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex crystal in the tetrahedral antiferromagnetic order on a triangular lattice. The noncoplanar tetrahedral state consists of four sublattices with spins oriented along the faces of a tetrahedron in spin space. The long-range order characterized by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology arises due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and appears at zero temperature and without external fields. Each vortex carries a half-integer electric charge relative to the uniform background in itinerant magnets, enabling the emergence of anyonic excitations. Its magnetic excitations include magnetically active gyrotropic and breathing modes, which -- under an external magnetic field -- carry nontrivial Chern numbers that stabilize chiral magnon edge states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We leverage the power of neural quantum states to describe the ground state wave function of solid and liquid atomic hydrogen, including both electronic and protonic degrees of freedom. For static protons, the resulting Born-Oppenheimer energies are consistently comparable to or lower than all previous projector Monte Carlo results for systems containing up to $128$ hydrogen atoms. The same level of accuracy is preserved upon inclusion of nuclear quantum effects, thus going beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In addition, our description overcomes major limitations of current wave functions, notably by avoiding any explicit symmetry assumption on the expected quantum crystal, and sidestepping efficiency issues of imaginary time evolution with disparate mass scales. As a first application, we examine crystal formation in an extremely high-density region up to pressure-induced melting.</description>

Abstract: We develop a simple scheme to distinguish between metals and insulators, or more generally gapless and gapped phases, by introducing the notion of an approximate symmetry order parameter. For one dimensional systems, we provide an explicit proof for the known criteria of metals and insulators based on the polarization operator which have been widely accepted for decades without a rigorous proof. For higher dimensions, we introduce a tiny magnetic flux to control the system, where the translation symmetry becomes approximate. We show that insulators and metals can be well distinguished with use of the approximate symmetry operators and they work as quantized order parameters in the thermodynamic limit characterizing gapless and gapped nature of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by good agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results establish non-invertible dualities as both a generative mechanism and a diagnostic tool for quantum many- body scarring, offering a generalized symmetry-based route to weak ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the boundary phase diagram and the low-temperature heat and magnetization transport at a $Y$-junction of XX spin chains. Depending on the magnetization axis anisotropy between the magnetic exchange interactions at the junction, the system exhibits two different strong-coupling regimes at low energies/temperatures, similar to the overscreened (topological) four- and to the two-channel Kondo fixed points. Using renormalization group arguments combined with boundary conformal field theory methods, we show the instability of the former under any XY-type anisotropy at the junction. We analyze the low-temperature spin and the heat conductances. We find evidence of spin fractionalization of the elementary excitations at the four-channel Kondo fixed point by means of the magnetic Wiedemann-Franz law. We caution that the instability under XY anisotropy may hinder the detection of the phenomenology related to the four-channel Kondo effect, therefore requiring careful control in experimental realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum materials whose properties lie beyond the celebrated Landau Fermi-liquid paradigm have been observed for decades across diverse material platforms. Finding microscopic lattice models for metallic states that exhibit such peculiar behavior remains a major theoretical challenge, as these features often originate from strong quantum fluctuations in strongly interacting electron systems. Here we investigate a three-orbital Hubbard model at a high-symmetry point that hosts a transition from a metallic to an orbital-selective Mott (OSM) phase. Employing single-site dynamical mean-field theory combined with full-density-matrix numerical renormalization group, we chart the $T-U$ phase diagram and obtain high-resolution real-frequency dynamics. In the OSM regime we find asymptotically scale-invariant (power-law) single-particle spectra and asymptotic $\omega/T$ scaling in both charge and spin channels, spanning several decades in frequency and temperature.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice</title>

Abstract: The nature of the intermediate ground-state phase in the spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice model has long been debated. Using cluster density matrix embedding theory, we investigate the phase diagram of this model. The Neel phase is directly identified for J2&lt;0.45 and the collinear phase for J2&gt;0.65 based on the ground state. Although no direct evidence of an internal phase transition is found within the intermediate phase from the ground state, analysis of the first excited state wave function reveals a continuous quantum phase transition in this region, with a critical point at J2=0.55. This critical point divides the intermediate phase into PVBS and CVBS.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Nonstabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of a dynamical Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (dDMI) in centrosymmetric crystals by generally considering the vibration of both cations and anions. It gives rise to an antisymmetric spin-lattice coupling, inducing magnon-phonon hybridized topological excitations. Moreover, we find that this dDMI naturally exhibits a magnetoelectric feature, leading to the presence of dynamic multiferroicity with finite toroidal moment distribution in the momentum space. By comparing toroidal moments with band skyrmion structure, we reveal the intrinsic connection between band topology and dynamic multiferroicity through the dDMI.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.</description>

      <title>Irrational CFTs from coupled anyon chains with non-invertible symmetries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irrational CFTs in 1+1d with a discrete spectrum and no conserved currents other than the stress-tensor are expected to be generic, unsolvable by standard methods, and hard to construct explicitly. We introduce a lattice model that realizes a candidate for such a CFT as a conformal phase of matter without fine-tuning. The model is constructed by coupling $N\geq3$ golden anyon chains together, preserving $N$ copies of the Fibonacci non-invertible symmetry. We use the MPS/DMRG approach to study this model numerically, which allows us to calculate the corresponding conformal data, obtaining hints of its irrationality. Along the way, we characterize the phase diagram for $N=2$ coupled chains where we identify a weakly first-order phase transition as well as critical points that we are able to identify with known rational CFTs, except for one case. We also provide an extensive list of rational CFTs with $1&lt;c&lt;2.1$.</description>

      <title>Random displacements in critical Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in Rydberg atom chains of experimentally realistic scale, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: We construct the $Z_{N}$ symmetry extended fusion ring of bulk and chiral theories and the corresponding modular partition functions with nonanomalous subgroup $Z_{n}(\subset Z_{N})$. The chiral fusion ring provides fundamental data for the $Z_{N}$ graded symmetry topological field theories and also provides algebraic data of smeared boundary conformal field theories describing zero modes of the extended models. For more general multicomponent or coupled systems, we also obtain a new series of extended theories. By applying the folding trick, their partition functions correspond to charged or gapped domain walls or massless renormalization group flows preserving quotient group structures.</description>

Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics'' is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the ($d$-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal'' (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Dichroism from Chiral Thermoelectric Probes: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>
