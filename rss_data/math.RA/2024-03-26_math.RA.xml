      <title>The automorphisms of differential extensions of characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonassociative differential extensions are generalizations of associative differential extensions, either of a purely inseparable field extension $K$ of exponent one of a field $F$, $F$ of characteristic $p$, or of a central division algebra over a purely inseparable field extension of $F$. Associative differential extensions are well known central simple algebras first defined by Amitsur and Jacobson. We explicitly compute the automorphisms of nonassociative differential extensions. These are canonically obtained by restricting automorphisms of the differential polynomial ring used in the construction of the algebra. In particular, we obtain descriptions for the automorphisms of associative differential extensions of $D$ and $K$, which are known to be inner.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the first Tits construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field of characteristic not 2 or 3. The first Tits construction is a well-known tripling process to construct separable cubic Jordan algebras, especially Albert algebras. We generalize the first Tits construction by choosing the scalar employed in the tripling process outside of the base field. This yields a new family of nonassociative unital algebras which carry a cubic map, and maps that can be viewed as generalized adjoint and generalized trace maps. These maps display properties often similar to the ones in the classical setup. In particular, the cubic norm map permits some kind of weak Jordan composition law.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Freudenthal triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we concern with the classification of complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 which are produced, as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of certain affine varieties related with $\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}\times\mathbb{P}^{1}$-fibrations. Such affine varieties or their appropriate weighted projectivizations are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We realize that the equations of the key varieties can be described conceptually by Freudenthal triple systems (FTS, for short). The paper consists of two parts. In Part 1, we revisit the general theory of FTS; the main purpose of Part 1 is to derive the conditions of so called strictly regular elements in FTS so as to fit with our description of key varieties. Then, in Part 2, we define several key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds from the conditions of strictly regular elements in FTS. Among other things obtained in Part 2, we show that there exists a $14$-dimensional factorial affine variety $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ of codimension $4$ in an affine $18$-space with only Gorenstein terminal singularities, and we construct examples of prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of No.20544 in [GRDB] as weighted complete intersections of the weighted projectivization of $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ in the weighted projective space $\mathbb{P}(1^{15},2^{2},3)$. We also clarify in Part 2 a relation between $\mathfrak{U}_{\mathbb{A}}^{14}$ and the $G_{2}^{(4)}$-cluster variety, which is a key variety for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds constructed in [CD].</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first aim of this paper is to construct a $13$-dimensional affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ related with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibration. It is well-known that the affine cone of the Segre embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is defined as the null loci of the so called $\sharp$-mapping of a 9-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Inspired with this fact, we construct $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ in the same way coordinatizing $J$ with 8 parameters. We derive such a coordinatization of $J$ using fixed three complementary primitive idempotents and the associated Peirce decomposition of $J$.
  The second aim of this paper is to construct complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds of anti-canonical codimension 4 as weighted complete intersections of appropriate weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties (possibly allowing some coordinates with weight $0$). The affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and such weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ are called key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds. We show that a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold of genus $3$ with three $\frac{1}{2}(1,1,1)$-singularities belonging to the class of No.5.4 as in [Tak1] is constructed from one weighted projectivization of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ such that all the coordinates have positive weights. Conversely, we also show that any such a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold is obtained in this way. Moreover, relating $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ with the $C_{2}$-cluster variety constructed by Coughlan and Ducat [CD1], we show that weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or its subvarieties are key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-folds belonging to 108 classes in the online database [GRDB].</description>

      <title>Symplectic differential reduction algebras and skew-affine generalized Weyl algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a map $\varphi\!:U(\mathfrak{g})\rightarrow A$ of associative algebras, $U(\mathfrak{g})$ the universal enveloping algebra of a (complex) finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra, the representation theory of $A$ is intimately tied to the representation theory of the $A$-subquotient known as the reduction algebra for $(A,\mathfrak{g}, \varphi)$. Herlemont and Ogievetsky studied differential reduction algebras for the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ as the algebra of $h$-deformed differential operators formed from realizations of $\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ in the $N$-fold tensor product of the $n $th Weyl algebra. In this paper, we further the study of differential reduction algebras by presenting the symplectic differential reduction algebra $D\big(\mathfrak{sp}(4)\big)$, by generators and relations, and showing its connections to Bavula's generalized Weyl algebras (GWAs). In doing so, we determine a new class of GWAs we call $\textit{skew-affine}$ GWAs, of which $D\big(\mathfrak{gl}(2)\big)$ and $D\big(\mathfrak{sp}(4)\big)$ are examples. We conjecture that the differential reduction algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$ is a twisted generalized Weyl algebra (TGWA) and that the relations for $D\big(\mathfrak{sp}(2n)\big)$ yield solutions to the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation (DYBE).</description>

Abstract: Square matrices of the form $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}} =\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{e}D \mathbf{f}^\mathsf{T}$ are considered. An explicit expression for the inverse is given, provided $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}$ and $D$ are invertible with $\text{rank}(\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}) =\text{rank}(\mathbf{A})+\text{rank}(\mathbf{e}D \mathbf{f}^\mathsf{T})$. The inverse is presented in two alternative ways, one that uses singular value decomposition and another that depends directly on the components $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{e}$, $\mathbf{f}$ and $D$. As a consequence of the derivations follows a rank-deficient matrix determinant lemma.</description>

      <title>Factorization of polynomials over the symmetrized tropical semiring and Descartes' rule of sign over ordered valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetrized tropical semiring is an extension of the tropical semifield, initially introduced to solve tropical linear systems using Cramer's rule. It is equivalent to the real tropical hyperfield, which has been used in the study of tropicalizations of semialgebraic sets. Polynomials over the symmetrized tropical semiring, and their factorizations, were considered by Quadrat. Recently, Baker and Lorscheid introduced a notion of multiplicity for the roots of univariate polynomials over hyperfields. In the special case of the hyperfield of signs, they related multiplicities with Descarte's rule of sign for real polynomials. We investigate here the factorizations of univariate polynomial functions over symmetrized tropical semirings, and relate them with the multiplicities of roots over these semirings. We deduce a Descartes' rule for ``signs and valuations'', which applies to polynomials over a real closed field with a convex valuation and an arbitrary (divisible) value group. We show in particular that the inequality of the Descartes' rule is tight when the value group is non-trivial. This extends to arbitrary value groups a characterization of Gunn in the rank one case, answering also to the tightness question. Our results are obtained using the framework of semiring systems introduced by Rowen, together with model theory of valued fields.</description>

      <title>On 3-generated axial algebras of Jordan type half</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axial algebras of Jordan type $\eta$ are a special type of commutative non-associative algebras. They are generated by idempotents whose adjoint operators have the minimal polynomial dividing $(x-1)x(x-\eta)$, where $\eta$ is a fixed value that is not equal to $0$ or $1$. These algebras have restrictive multiplication rules that generalize the Peirce decomposition for idempotents in Jordan algebras.
  A universal $3$-generated algebra of Jordan type $\frac{1}{2}$ as an algebra with $4$ parameters was constructed by I. Gorshkov and A. Staroletov. Depending on the value of the parameter, the universal algebra may contain a non-trivial form radical. In this paper, we describe all semisimple $3$-generated algebras of Jordan type $\frac{1}{2}$ over a quadratically closed field.</description>

      <title>On m-tuples of nilpotent 2x2 matrices over an arbitrary field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebra of ${\rm GL}_n$-invariants of $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ matrices with respect to the action by simultaneous conjugation is a classical topic in case of infinite base field. On the other hand, in case of a finite field generators of polynomial invariants even in case of a pair of $2\times 2$ matrices are not known. Working over an arbitrary field we classified all ${\rm GL}_2$-orbits on $m$-tuples of $2\times 2$ nilpotent matrices for all $m&gt;0$. As a consequence, we obtained a minimal separating set for the algebra of ${\rm GL}_2$-invariant polynomial functions of $m$-tuples of $2\times 2$ nilpotent matrices. We also described the least possible number of elements of a separating set for an algebra of invariant polynomial functions over a finite field.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Tsetlin modules: canonicity and calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06029v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a more down-to-earth introduction to the connection between Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ and diagrammatic KLRW algebras, and develop some of its consequences. In addition to a new proof of this description of the category Gelfand-Tsetlin modules appearing in earlier work, we show three new results of independent interest: (1) we show that every simple Gelfand-Tsetlin module is a canonical module in the sense of Early, Mazorchuk and Vishnyakova, and characterize when two maximal ideals have isomorphic canonical modules, (2) we show that the dimensions of Gelfand-Tsetlin weight spaces in simple modules can be computed using an appropriate modification of Leclerc's algorithm for computing dual canonical bases, and (3) we construct a basis of the Verma modules of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ which consists of generalized eigenvectors for the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra.
  Furthermore, we present computations of multiplicities and Gelfand-Kirillov dimensions for all integral Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in ranks 3 and 4; unfortunately, for ranks $&gt;4$, our computers are not adequate to perform these computations.</description>

      <title>Twisted traces on abelian quantum Higgs and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted traces on the quantum Higgs branches $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules, confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum Hikita isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Localization theorems for approximable triangulated categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximable triangulated categories, as introduced and developed by Neeman, provide a solid framework for studying localization sequences within triangulated categories. In our paper, we demonstrate that a recollement of approximable triangulated categories, given certain mild conditions, induces short exact sequences of both triangulated subcategories and Verdier quotient categories. Specifically, in the case of a recollement of locally Hom-finite noetherian approximable triangulated categories, we find that this induces a short exact sequence of the bounded closures of compact objects within these categories. Furthermore, if the recollement extends one step downwards, it yields a short exact sequence of the singularity categories of these triangulated categories, offering a generalization of the localization sequence established by Jin-Yang-Zhou for the singularity categories of finite-dimensional algebras. We also present applications of these results within the derived categories of finite-dimensional algebras, DG algebras, and schemes.</description>
