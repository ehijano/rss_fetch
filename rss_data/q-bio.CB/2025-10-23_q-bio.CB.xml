      <title>Lineage topology, replication kinetics and cell cycle synchronization reveal regulated growth dynamics in human bone marrow stromal cell colonies</title>

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) -- which include skeletal stem cells -- are a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential.</description>

      <title>FP-IRL: Fokker-Planck Inverse Reinforcement Learning -- A Physics-Constrained Approach to Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a powerful paradigm for uncovering the incentive structure that drives agent behavior, by inferring an unknown reward function from observed trajectories within a Markov decision process (MDP). However, most existing IRL methods require access to the transition function, either prescribed or estimated \textit{a priori}, which poses significant challenges when the underlying dynamics are unknown, unobservable, or not easily sampled.
  We propose Fokker--Planck inverse reinforcement learning (FP-IRL), a novel physics-constrained IRL framework tailored for systems governed by Fokker--Planck (FP) dynamics. FP-IRL simultaneously infers both the reward and transition functions directly from trajectory data, without requiring access to sampled transitions. Our method leverages a conjectured equivalence between MDPs and the FP equation, linking reward maximization in MDPs with free energy minimization in FP dynamics. This connection enables inference of the potential function using our inference approach of variational system identification, from which the full set of MDP components -- reward, transition, and policy -- can be recovered using analytic expressions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP-IRL through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and a modified version of the Mountain Car problem. Our results show that FP-IRL achieves accurate recovery of agent incentives while preserving computational efficiency and physical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Software System for Low-Cost, Brightfield Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation for Cytometric Auto-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent chal- lenges of bright-field images - their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology - coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis frame- work designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular archi- tecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications - particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility</description>
