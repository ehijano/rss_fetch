      <title>Host-star and exoplanet composition: Polluted white dwarf reveals depletion of moderately refractory elements in planetary material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets form from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust as their host stars. Confirming if planetary bodies acquire the same refractory element composition as their natal disc during formation, and how efficiently volatile elements are incorporated into growing planets, is key to linking the poorly constrained interior composition of rocky exoplanets to the observationally-constrained composition of their host star. Such comparisons also afford insight into the planet formation process. This work compares planetary composition with host-star composition using observations of a white dwarf that has accreted planetary material and its F-type star wide binary companion as a reference for the composition of the natal molecular gas and dust. Spectroscopic analysis reveals abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti in both stars. We use the white dwarf measurements to estimate the composition of the exoplanetary material and the F-type companion to constrain the composition of the material the planet formed from. Comparing planetary material to the composition of its natal cloud, our results reveal that the planetary material is depleted in moderate refractories (Mg, Si, Fe) relative to the refractory material (Ca, Ti). Grouping elements based on their condensation temperatures is key to linking stellar and planetary compositions. Fractionation during formation or subsequent planetary evolution leads to the depletion of moderate refractories from the planetary material accreted by the white dwarf. This signature, as seen for bulk Earth, will likely be present in the composition of many exoplanets relative to their host-stars.</description>

      <title>A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high resolution fourth-order Pad\'e scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers with small vortices with all three components are active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations than in a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at mid-radius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the upper layers of the disk.</description>

      <title>Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: the Mid-Infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres which include disequilibrium chemistry and have a non-adiabatic pressure-temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from lambda = 4.5 um to lambda = 10 um is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated WISE W2 - W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 um flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 um flux to the 10 - 15 um flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2 - W3 colors which are likely to be very low gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2 - W3 and we find that the 4 to 18 um JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold very low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary states and triplicity of four massive semi-detached binaries with long-term decreasing orbital periods in the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive semi-detached binary with a long-term decreasing orbital period may involve a rapid mass-transfer phase in Case A, and thus they are good astrophysical laboratories for investigating the evolution of massive binary stars. In this work, by using the long-term observational light curves from the OGLE project and other data in the low-metallicity LMC, four semi-detached massive binaries with long-term decreases in the orbital periods are detected from 165 EB-type close binaries. It is found that the more massive component in S07798 is filling its Roche lobe where the period decrease is caused by mass transfer from the primary to the secondary. However, the other three (S03065, S12631, S16873) are semi-detached binaries with a lobe-filling secondary where the mass transfer between the components should cause the period to increase if the angular momentum is conservative. The long-term period decreases in these three systems may be caused by the angular momentum loss. Additionally, the orbital periods of three systems (S03065, S07798, S16873) are detected to show cyclic variation with periods shorter than 11 years, which can be plausibly explained by the presence of close-in third bodies in these massive binaries. Based on all of these results, it is suggested that the detected four semi-detached binaries almost have multiplicity. The companion stars are crucial for the origin and evolution of these massive close binaries.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Evolution of Thermodynamic Properties and their Connection to the Global Kinematics of High-Speed Coronal Mass Ejections Using FRIS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most earlier studies have been limited to estimating the kinematic evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and only limited efforts have been made to investigate their thermodynamic evolution. We focus on the interplay of the thermal properties of CMEs with their observed global kinematics. We implement the Flux rope Internal State (FRIS) model to estimate variations in the polytropic index, heating rate per unit mass, temperature, pressure, and various internal forces. The model incorporates inputs of 3D kinematics obtained from the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model. In our study, we chose nine fast-speed CMEs from 2010 to 2012. Our investigation elucidates that the selected fast-speed CMEs show a heat-release phase at the beginning, followed by a heat-absorption phase with a near-isothermal state in their later propagation phase. The thermal state transition, from heat release to heat absorption, occurs at around 3($\pm$0.3) to 7($\pm$0.7) $R_\odot$ for different CMEs. We found that the CMEs with higher expansion speeds experience a less pronounced sharp temperature decrease before gaining a near-isothermal state. The differential emission measurement (DEM) analysis findings, using multi-wavelength observation from SDO/AIA, also show a heat release state of CMEs at lower coronal heights. We also find the dominant internal forces influencing CME radial expansion at varying distances from the Sun. Our study shows the need to characterize the internal thermodynamic properties of CMEs better in both observational and modeling studies, offering insights for refining assumptions of a constant value of the polytropic index during the evolution of CMEs.</description>

      <title>ALMA Spectral Survey of An eruptive Young star, V883 Ori (ASSAY): II. Freshly Sublimated Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the Keplerian Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with ALMA in Band 6 (220.7$-$274.9 GHz). We identified about 3,700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the iterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars identified from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of solar energetic particle events originated from coronal mass ejection shocks with a data-driven physics-based transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and/or solar flares. SEPs travel through the corona and interplanetary space to reach Earth, posing a radiation hazard to spacecraft and astronauts working in space and the electronics on spacecraft. Due to the distinct magnetic field configuration and solar eruption kinematic properties associated with each event, the utilization of a data-driven model becomes essential for predicting SEP hazards. In this study, we use a developed model that utilizes photospheric magnetic field measurements and CME shock observations as inputs to simulate several historical SEP events associated with fast CME speeds (&gt;700 km/s). The model includes an SEP source term aligned with the theory of diffusive shock acceleration by the CME shock. The performance of the model is accessed by comparing simulations and observations of SEP intensity time profiles at SOHO, ACE, STEREO-A and STEREO-B. The results generally matched observations well, particularly for protons below 40.0 MeV. However, discrepancies arose for higher-energy protons, notably for the events on 2011 March 7 and 2014 February 25, where the simulation tended to overestimate the proton flux . At STEREO-A, the modeled proton intensities for the SEP events on 2013 April 11 and 2011 March 7 display a very different behavior compared to observations because of the efficient transport in longitude caused by the weak magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A 3D Simulation of a Type II-P Supernova: from Core Bounce to Beyond Shock Breakout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to better connect core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) theory with its observational signatures, we have developed a simulation pipeline from the onset of core collapse to beyond shock breakout. Using this framework, we present a three-dimensional simulation study following the evolution from five seconds to over five days of a 17-M$_{\odot}$ progenitor that explodes with $\sim$10$^{51}$ erg of energy and $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni ejecta. The early explosion is highly asymmetric, expanding most prominently along the southern hemisphere. This early asymmetry is preserved to shock breakout, $\sim$1 day later. Breakout itself evinces strong angle-dependence, with as much a day delay in shock breakout by direction. The nickel ejecta closely tails the forward shock, with velocities at breakout as high as $\sim$7000 km s$^{-1}$. A delayed reverse shock forming at the H/He interface on hour timescales leads to the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, fast-moving nickel bullets, and almost complete mixing of the metal core into the hydrogen envelope. For the first time, we illustrate the angle-dependent emergent broadband and bolometric light curves from simulations evolved in three-dimensions in entirety, continuing through hydrodynamic shock breakout a CCSN model of a massive stellar progenitor evolved with detailed, late-time neutrino microphysics and transport. Our case study of a single progenitor suggests that 3D simulations initiated with detailed neutrino heating can begin to generically produce the cornucopia of suggested asymmetries and features in CCSNe observations, while establishing the methodology to study this problem in breadth.</description>

Abstract: Detecting exoplanets and other faint sources of emitted and reflected light near a bright star requires deeply suppressing the starlight while efficiently transmitting the dim light from its surroundings. This suppression can be carried out by coronagraphs, nulling interferometers, and starshades. This chapter provides a brief overview of these technologies, emphasizing coronagraphs.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of uniform rotation on the structure of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by recent laboratory experiments and astronomical observations, significant advances have deepened our understanding of neutron-star physics. NICER's Pulse Profile Modeling has refined our knowledge of neutron star masses and radii, while gravitational-wave detections have revealed key insights into the structure of neutron stars. Particularly relevant is the extraction of the tidal deformability by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration and the most recent determination of stellar radii by NICER, both suggesting a relatively soft equation of state (EOS) at intermediate densities. Additionally, measurements from the PREX collaboration and from pulsar timing suggest instead that the EOS is stiff in the vicinity of saturation density and at the highest densities accessible to date. But how stiff can the EOS be at these very high densities? Recent events featuring compact objects near the "lower mass gap" have raised questions about the existence of very massive neutron stars. Motivated by this finding and in light of new refinements to theoretical models, we explore the possibility that these massive objects may indeed be rapidly rotating neutron stars. We explore how rotation affects both the maximum neutron star mass and their associated radii, and discuss the implications they may have on the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates below $T_9=3$ by a non-adiabatic three-body model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The triple-$\alpha$ reaction from ternary continuum states at off-resonant energies, $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha \rightarrow ^{12}$C, still remains in unsolved problems. This direct process is estimated with a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyper-spherical harmonics and $R$-matrix expansion method. After reviewing this model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1 \rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be in 10$^{-15}$--10$^{-3}$ pico-barn order for $0.15 \le E \le 0.35$ MeV. This is far below the values predicted by the recent adiabatic calculations. In spite of the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \le T_9 \le 3$ including helium burning temperatures. The difference below $E = 0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates are found to be reduced by about 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9 = 0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining sensitivity to 3$\alpha$ potentials. With introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\alpha+^8$Be may be eliminated by hand.</description>

Abstract: As a well-known open cluster, NGC 2323 (also called M50) has been widely investigated for over a hundred years and has always been considered a classical single cluster. In this work, with the help of Gaia DR3, we study the binary structure nature of this cluster. Although indistinguishable in the spatial space, the small but undeniable difference in the proper motion indicates that they may be two individual clusters. After investigating the properties of the two clusters, it is found that they have very close positions (three-dimensional $\Delta$pos = 12.3 pc, $\sigma_{\Delta \mathrm{pos}} = 3.4$ pc) and similar tangential velocities (two-dimensional $\Delta$V = 2.2 km s$^{-1}$, $\sigma_{\Delta \mathrm{V}} = 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$), indicating the existence of their physical association. Moreover, the best isochrone fitting ages of the two clusters are the same (158 Myr), further proving their possibly common origin. To comprehensively understand the formation and evolution of this binary cluster, we employ the PETAR $N$-body code to trace back their birthplace and deduce their dynamical evolutionary fate. With observational mean cluster properties, the simulations suggest that they may form together, and then orbit each other as a binary cluster for over 200 Myr. After that, because of their gradual mass loss, the two clusters will eventually separate and evolve into two independent clusters. Meanwhile, the numerical $N$-body simulation suggests that the less massive cluster is unlikely to be the cluster tidal tails created by the differential rotation of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the structure and kinematics of the ionized core of M\,2-9 with ALMA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present interferometric observations at 1 and 3\,mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of the free-free continuum and mm-wavelength recombination line (mRRL) emission of the ionized core (within $\lsim$130\,au) of the young Planetary Nebula (PN) candidate M\,2-9.These inner regions are concealed in the vast majority of similar objects. A spectral index for the mm-to-cm continuum of $\sim$0.9 indicates predominantly free-free emission from an ionized wind, with a minor contribution from warm dust. The mm-continuum emission in M\,2-9 reveals an elongated structure along the main symmetry axis of the large-scale bipolar nebula with a C-shaped curvature surrounded by a broad-waisted component. This structure is consistent with an ionized bent jet and a perpendicular compact dusty disk. The presence of a compact equatorial disk (of radius $\sim$50\,au) is also supported by red-shifted CO and \trecem\ absorption profiles observed from the base of the receding north lobe against the compact background continuum. The redshift observed in the CO absorption profiles likely signifies gas infall movements from the disk toward a central source. The mRRLs exhibit velocity gradients along the axis, implying systematic expansion in the C-shaped bipolar outflow. The highest expansion velocities ($\sim$80\,\kms) are found in two diagonally opposed compact regions along the axis, referred to as the high-velocity spots/shells (HVS), indicating either rapid wind acceleration or shocks at radial distances of $\sim$0\farc02-0\farc04 ($\sim$15-25\,au) from the center. A subtle velocity gradient perpendicular to the lobes is also found, suggestive of rotation. Our ALMA observations detect increased brightness and broadness in the mRRLs... (abridged).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of Type I X-ray bursts is attributed to those seen by the Astronomical Netherlands Satellite (ANS) in September 1975 from the globular cluster NGC6624 containing the X-ray source 4U1820-303. I revisit these X-ray bursts, by re-analysing data from the Soft X-ray Experiment (SXX) onboard ANS, which were stored on microfiche. Earlier accounts of X-ray bursts had been reported; the first Type I X-ray burst recorded is the one observed by Vela 5B from Cen X-4 in July 1969.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on color-superconducting phases in compact stars within the RG-consistent NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine parameters of the renormalization group-consistent (RG-consistent) three-flavor color-superconducting Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model that are suited to investigate possible compact-star configurations. Our goal is to provide viable quark-matter equation of state (EoS) that can generally be used for hybrid-star constructions. To that end, we mainly focus on quark-star properties in this work. By varying the vector and diquark coupling constants, we analyze their impact on the EoS, speed of sound (SoS), the maximum diquark gap, and the mass-radius relation. In almost all configurations, a stable color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase appears in the core of the maximum-mass configurations, typically spanning several kms in radius. In other cases, the star's two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) branch of the EoS becomes unstable before reaching the CFL transition density. At neutron-star densities, the SoS squared reaches up to 0.6 and the CFL diquark gap up to 250 MeV. We argue that adding a hadronic EoS at lower densities by performing a Maxwell construction, does not increase the maximum mass substantially, thus we use the 2 solar mass constraint to constrain the NJL model parameters that are suited for the construction of hybrid-star EoS. We construct three examples of the hybrid star model, demonstrating that there is room for different CSC compositions. The hybrid EoS obtained in this way can have no 2SC matter or different ratios of 2SC and CFL quark matter in the core. We show that early hadron-quark transitions are possible that can modify the tidal deformability at 1.4 solar mass. We will provide tabulated EoS of the RG-consistent NJL model for these three parameter sets. We find that these EoS are consistent with the imposed constraints from astrophysics and perturbative QCD. They allow for different hybrid-star scenarios with a hadronic EoS that is soft at low densities.</description>

      <title>Temporal and chromatic variation of polarized scattered light in the outer disk of PDS 70</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PDS 70 is a unique system as it hosts a protoplanetary disk with two confirmed forming planets, making it an ideal target for characterizing dust in such disks. We present new high-contrast polarimetric differential imaging of PDS 70 using the $N\_R$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL, combined with archival VLT/SPHERE data across five wavelengths ($N\_R$, $VBB$, $J$, $H$, and $Ks$) spanning seven epochs over eight years. For each epoch, we corrected smearing effects from instrument resolution, analyzed azimuthal brightness profiles, and derived intrinsic disk-integrated polarized reflectivity and brightness contrasts. Our analysis reveals significant temporal variability in both integrated polarized reflectivity and azimuthal brightness profiles, suggesting variable shadowing on the outer disk from unresolved inner disk structures. Nonetheless, we observe a systematic wavelength-dependent contrast between the near and far sides of the inclined disk, highlighting the need to consider shadowing from the inner disk and surface geometry of the reflecting disk in data interpretation.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first toward and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

Abstract: SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of 504 cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the first 34 months of observations of SDSS-V. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to aid with the identification of CV candidates among the over 2 million SDSS-V spectra obtained with the BOSS spectrograph. The CNN reduced the number of spectra that required visual inspection to $\simeq2$ per cent of the total. We identified 776 CV spectra among the CNN-selected candidates, plus an additional 27 CV spectra that the CNN misclassified, but that were found serendipitously by human inspection of the data. Analysing the SDSS-V spectroscopy and ancillary data of the 504 CVs in our sample, we report 61 new CVs, spectroscopically confirm 248 and refute 13 published CV candidates, and we report 82 new or improved orbital periods. We discuss the completeness and possible selection biases of the machine learning methodology, as well as the effectiveness of targeting CV candidates within SDSS-V. Finally, we re-assess the space density of CVs, and find $1.2\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$.</description>

      <title>Supernova Shocks Cannot Explain the Inflated State of Hypervelocity Runaways from White Dwarf Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have found a growing number of hypervelocity stars with speeds of $\approx 1500-2500\,$km\,s$^{-1}$ which could have only been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Most of the observed hypervelocity runaways in this class display a surprising inflated structure: their current radii are roughly an order of magnitude greater than they would have been as white dwarfs filling their Roche lobe. While many simulations exist studying the dynamical phase leading to supernova detonation in these systems, no detailed calculations of the long-term structure of the runaways have yet been performed. We use an existing \textsc{Arepo} hydrodynamical simulation of a supernova in a white dwarf binary as a starting point for the evolution of these stars with the 1 dimensional stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the supernova shock is not enough to inflate the white dwarf over timescales longer than a few thousand years, significantly shorter than the $10^{5-6}$ year lifetimes inferred for observed hypervelocity runaways. Despite experiencing a shock from a supernova less than $\approx 0.02\,R_\odot$ away, our models do not experience significant interior heating, and all contract back to radii around $0.01\,R_\odot$ within about $10^4$\,years. Explaining the observed inflated states requires either an additional source of significant heating or some other physics that is not yet accounted for in the subsequent evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to panspermia, life on Earth may have originated from life forms transported through space from elsewhere. These life forms could have passed through molecular clouds, where the process of methanogenesis could have provided enough energy to sustain living organisms. In this study, we have calculated the Gibbs free energy released from synthesizing hydrocarbons for methanogenic (acetogenic) life in a molecular cloud, with methane (acetic acid) as the final metabolic product. Our calculations demonstrate that the chemical reactions during methanogenesis can release enough free energy to support living organisms. The methanogenic life may have served as the predecessor of life on Earth, and there is some preliminary evidence from various molecular biology studies to support this idea. Furthermore, we propose a potential distinguishing signal to test our model.</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 60%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. Fewer than 1% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the star formation occurring in the Planck Galactic cold clump PGCC 120.69+2.66. Near-infrared JHKs images and K-band spectroscopy obtained with NOTCam at the Nordic Optical Telescope complemented with archive data are used to study the stellar content. In addition, millimetre line CO and CS spectra were obtained with the Onsala 20 m telescope, and sub-millimetre continuum SCUBA archive data are used to characterise the host molecular cloud. We identify a molecular cloud core traced by CO and CS emission at a distance of 1.1 kpc. In the region studied, we identify 5 submm continuum cores. Embedded in and around these dense submm cores, we find 38 young stellar objects, classified as 9 Class I, 8 Class II, and 21 near-IR excess or variability sources, accompanied by bipolar nebulosities and signs of protostellar jets. Furthermore, a very bright and reddened source is found towards this molecular cloud core. Even though its location appears to suggest its association to the star formation region, its infrared spectral type is compatible with a red supergiant, hidden behind 36 mag of visual extinction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capture and annihilation of WIMP-like dark matter in red giant stars can lead to faster-than-expected ignition of the helium core, and thus a lower tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) luminosity. We use Gaia data to place constraints on the dark matter-nucleon cross section using 22 globular clusters with measured TRGB luminosities, and place projections on the sensitivity resulting from 161 clusters with full phase space distributions observed by Gaia. Although limits remain weaker than those from Earth-based direct detection experiments, they represent a constraint that is fully independent of dark matter properties in the Solar neighbourhood, probing its properties across the entire Milky Way galaxy. Based on our findings, it is likely that the use of the TRGB as a standard candle in $H_0$ measurements is very robust against the effects of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present cogsworth, an open-source Python tool for producing self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. With cogsworth one can (1) sample a population of binaries and star formation history, (2) perform rapid (binary) stellar evolution, (3) integrate orbits through the galaxy and (4) inspect the full evolutionary history of each star or compact object, as well as their positions and kinematics. We include the functionality for post-processing hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations as a basis for galactic potentials and star formation histories to better account for initial spatial stellar clustering and more complex potentials. Alternatively, several analytic models are available for both the potential and star formation history. cogsworth can transform the intrinsic simulated population to an observed population through the joint application of dust maps, bolometric correction functions and survey selection functions.
  We provide a detailed explanation of the functionality of cogsworth and demonstrate its capabilities through a series of use cases: (1) We predict the spatial distribution of compact objects and runaways in both dwarf and Milky-Way-like galaxies, (2) using a star cluster from a hydrodynamical simulation, we show how supernovae can change the orbits of stars in several ways, and (3) we predict the separation of disrupted binary stellar companions on the sky and create a synthetic Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. We also discuss some current limitations and plans for future developments. We designed cogsworth and its online documentation to provide a powerful tool for constraining binary evolution, but also a flexible and accessible resource for the entire community.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic neutrinos and the question of Dirac vs. Majorana neutrino nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult. This is generally believed to be due to the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical neutrino energies, and to the fact that in the limit of vanishing mass all distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos disappear. This, however, does not necessarily mean that for non-relativistic neutrinos distinguishing between them is an easy task. We consider this problem in detail. The issues discussed include the possibilities of studying neutrino nature with non-relativistic neutrinos produced in $\beta$ decay in direct neutrino mass measurement experiments, with relic neutrinos, as well as with slow neutrinos in pair production processes and in scattering, both elastic and inelastic. We also discuss processes allowed for only one of the two neutrino types as a means of uncovering neutrino nature.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band follow-up I. Carbon-chain chemistry of intermediate-mass protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23392v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} &lt; m_* &lt;8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.</description>
