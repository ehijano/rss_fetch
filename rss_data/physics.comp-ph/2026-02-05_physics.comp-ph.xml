      <title>Numerical study of loss of hyperbolicity using a cold plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of cold plasma equations taking into account electron-ion collisions in both relativistic and nonrelativistic cases. It is known that for a constant collision coefficient $\nu$, the solution to the Cauchy problem for such a system can lose smoothness. However, if the dependence of $\nu$ on the electron density $N$ is more than linear, then the solution remains globally smooth for any initial data. However, the appearance of the dependence $\nu(N)$ leads to a change in the type of the system, it loses hyperbolicity, which leads to computational problems. In this paper, we propose a new implicit solution method in Euler variables that overcomes these difficulties. It can be used in both nonrelativistic and relativistic cases and is tested for the threshold case of a linear dependence $\nu(N)=\nu_1+\nu_0 N$, when smoothness can still be lost. The computational experiments carried out are in full agreement with the available theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Topology- and Geometry-Exact Coupling for Incompressible Fluids and Thin Deformables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a topology-preserving discretization for coupling incompressible fluids with thin deformable structures, achieving guaranteed leakproofness through preservation of fluid domain connectivity. Our approach leverages a stitching algorithm applied to a clipped Voronoi diagram generated from Lagrangian fluid particles, in order to maintain path connectivity around obstacles. This geometric discretization naturally conforms to arbitrarily thin structures, enabling boundary conditions to be enforced exactly at fluid-solid interfaces. By discretizing the pressure projection equations on this conforming mesh, we can enforce velocity boundary conditions at the interface for the fluid while applying pressure forces directly on the solid boundary, enabling sharp two-way coupling between phases. The resulting method prevents fluid leakage through solids while permitting flow wherever a continuous path exists through the fluid domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on diverse scenarios including flows around thin membranes, complex geometries with narrow passages, and deformable structures immersed in liquid, showcasing robust two-way coupling without artificial sealing or leakage artifacts.</description>

      <title>At the Top of the Mountain, the World can Look Boltzmann-Like: Sampling Dynamics of Noisy Double-Well Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of the transistor as the cornerstone of digital computation motivates analogous efforts to identify an equivalent hardware primitive, the probabilistic bit or p-bit, for the emerging paradigm of probabilistic computing. Here, we uncover a fundamental ubiquity in the stochastic dynamics of double well energy systems when initialized near the barrier top. Using a topological framework grounded in Morse theory and singularity theory, we make use of the result that all smooth, even double well potentials reduce near the saddle point to a canonical quartic normal form. Within this regime, the interplay of noise, synaptic bias, and potential curvature produces a topologically robust short time evolution characterized by a tanh like response. This enables Boltzmann like sampling that is largely independent of the detailed shape of the potential, apart from its effective temperature scaling. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations across multiple representative systems corroborate this behavior. Our work provides a unifying foundation for assessing and engineering a broad class of physical platforms, including oscillators, bistable latches, and magnetic devices, as p-bits operating within a synchronous framework for stochastic sampling and probabilistic computation.</description>

      <title>Backend-agnostic Julia framework for 3D modeling and inversion of gravity data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-performance framework for three-dimensional gravity modeling and inversion implemented in Julia, addressing key challenges in geophysical modeling such as computational complexity, ill-posedness, and the non-uniqueness inherent to gravity inversion. The framework adopts a data-space inversion formulation to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, leading to significantly lower memory requirements and improved computational efficiency while maintaining inversion accuracy. Forward modeling and inversion operators are implemented within a backend-agnostic kernel abstraction, enabling execution on both multicore CPUs and GPU accelerators from a single code base. Performance analyses conducted on NVIDIA CUDA GPUs demonstrate substantial reductions in runtime relative to CPU execution, particularly for large-scale datasets involving up to approximately 3.3 million rectangular prisms, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach. The inversion incorporates implicit model constraints through the data-space formulation and depth-weighted sensitivity, which mitigate depth-related amplitude decay and yield geologically coherent, high-resolution subsurface density models. Validation using synthetic models confirms the ability of the framework to accurately reconstruct complex subsurface structures such as vertical and dipping dykes. Application to field gravity data further demonstrates the robustness and practical utility of the GPU-accelerated framework, with the recovered models showing strong consistency with independent geological constraints and prior interpretations. Overall, this work underscores the potential of GPU-enabled computing in Julia to transform large-scale gravity inversion workflows, providing an efficient, extensible, and accurate computational solution for high-resolution geophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Generative Neural Operators through Diffusion Last Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning discretization-invariant function-to-function mappings in scientific computing. However, many practical systems are inherently stochastic, making principled uncertainty quantification essential for reliable deployment. To address this, we introduce a simple add-on, the diffusion last layer (DLL), a lightweight probabilistic head that can be attached to arbitrary neural operator backbones to model predictive uncertainty. Motivated by the relative smoothness and low-dimensional structure often exhibited by PDE solution distributions, DLL parameterizes the conditional output distribution directly in function space through a low-rank Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, enabling efficient and expressive uncertainty modeling. Across stochastic PDE operator learning benchmarks, DLL improves generalization and uncertainty-aware prediction. Moreover, even in deterministic long-horizon rollout settings, DLL enhances rollout stability and provides meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty for backbone neural operators.</description>

      <title>UGA-SSMRPT2 -- A Multireference Perturbation Theory Predicting Accurate Electronic Excitation Energies in Diverse Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UGA-SSMRPT2, the spin-free perturbative analogue of Mukerjee's State-Specific Multireference Coupled Cluster Theory (MkMRCC) is known to be successful for size-extensive and intruder-free construction of dissociation curves. This work demonstrates that UGA-SSMRPT2 is also an accurate and computationally inexpensive framework for computing excitation energies. The method achieves near-chemical accuracy for the vast majority of $\pi \to \pi^*$, $n \to \pi^*$, charge-transfer, valence-Rydberg and Rydberg excited states commonly used for benchmarking electronic structure theories for excited states. Our results demonstrate that UGA-SSMRPT2 excitation energies lie within 0.20 eV of EOM-CCSD and/or well-established theoretical best estimates often surpassing the popular MRPT2 approaches like NEVPT2, CASPT2, and MCQDPT while typically requiring smaller active spaces. Its state-specific formulation circumvents the well-known intruder-state problem and eliminates the need for empirical parameters such as IPEA shifts in CASPT2. This work proposes UGA-SSMRPT2 as a robust, and scalable approach for modeling challenging electronic excited states.</description>

      <title>Exterior complex scaling enables physics-informed neural networks for quantum scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving differential equations, yet their application to quantum scattering problems has been hindered by the oscillatory, non-decaying nature of scattering wave functions. In this work, I demonstrate that exterior complex scaling (ECS) transforms scattering boundary conditions into exponentially decaying waves suitable for neural network solutions, enabling PINNs to solve nuclear scattering problems for the first time. I develop a driven-equation formulation where the source term is confined to the real axis, avoiding the need to analytically continue nuclear potentials into the complex plane. The method is validated on nucleon-nucleus scattering (n+$^{40}$Ca at $E_{\text{lab}}=20$~MeV) with 21 partial waves, achieving phase shift accuracy of $\Delta\delta &lt; 0.1^\circ$ for most channels when compared to conventional solvers. I further demonstrate the approach on heavy-ion scattering ($^6$Li+$^{208}$Pb at 40~MeV) with 41 partial waves and strong Coulomb effects. This work establishes the foundation for extending PINNs to inverse problems where end-to-end differentiability enables direct fitting of optical potential parameters, coupled-channel reactions, and few-body scattering where traditional grid methods face exponential scaling.</description>

      <title>Turbulence teaches equivariance to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the rotational nature of turbulence affects learned mappings between quantities governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. By varying the degree of anisotropy in a turbulence dataset, we explore how statistical symmetry affects these mappings. To do this, we train super-resolution models at different wall-normal locations in a channel flow, where anisotropy varies naturally, and test their generalization. By evaluating the learned mappings on new coordinate frames and new flow conditions, we find that coordinate-frame generalization is a key part of the generalization problem. Turbulent flows naturally present a wide range of local orientations, so respecting the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations improves generalization to new flows. Importantly, turbulence's rotational structure can embed these symmetries into learned mappings -- an effect that strengthens with isotropy and dataset size. This is because a more isotropic dataset samples a wider range of orientations, more fully covering the rotational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. The dependence on isotropy means equivariance error is also scale-dependent, consistent with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. Therefore, turbulence provides its own data augmentation (we term this implicit data augmentation). We expect this effect to apply broadly to learned mappings between tensorial flow quantities, making it relevant to most machine learning applications in turbulence.</description>

      <title>Atomistic and data-driven insights into the local slip resistances in random refractory multi-principal element alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) have attracted growing interest for their exceptional high-temperature strength, yet their complex compositions hinder a mechanistic understanding of plastic deformation. Here, we perform atomistic simulations to determine local slip resistances (LSRs) of edge and screw dislocations on primary BCC slip planes in 12 equal-molar RMPEAs. Machine learning is employed to uncover relationships between LSR and underlying material properties, enabling systematic assessment of compositional effects on dislocation behavior. Based on these insights, we develop a thermally activated, dislocation-based model to predict macroscopic yield stress. We find that increasing the fraction of hexagonal close-packed elements above 50% significantly reduces unstable stacking fault energy, ideal shear strength, and screw LSR across all slip planes. Higher elastic anisotropy further lowers these quantities, while lattice distortion modifies relative slip resistances between dislocation characters and slip systems. By combining an autoencoder with a random forest model, we identify elastic constants and lattice distortion as the dominant factors controlling LSR. The resulting framework accurately predicts tensile yield stress in BCC RMPEAs and provides guidance for alloy design.</description>

      <title>Addressing geometrical perturbations by applying generalized polynomial chaos to virtual density in continuous energy Monte-Carlo power iteration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the use of the virtual density method to model uniform geometrical perturbations. We propose a general algorithm in order to estimate explicitly the effect of geometrical perturbations in continuous-energy Monte Carlo power iteration simulations. We apply the intrusive generalized polynomial chaos method in order to estimate the coefficients of a reduced model giving the multiplication factor as a function of the amplitude of the geometrical perturbation. Our method accurately estimates the reactivity change induced by uniform expansion or swelling deformations of arbitrary geometries, for a large range of deformations within a single Monte Carlo simulation. The reduced model converges rapidly in polynomial order, does not require knowledge of the adjoint flux, and is free from indirect effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generative model that amortises computation for the field and potential around e.g.~gravitational or electromagnetic sources. Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources $M$ and evaluation points $N$, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field or potential around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves relative error of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g.~physics simulations. We compare with existing models and develop two-dimensional examples, including cases where sources overlap or have more complex geometries, to demonstrate its application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor-superconductor hybrid devices have been proposed as promising platforms for detecting and analyzing Majorana zero modes, which find applications in topological quantum computing. In this work, we solve the Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations to describe the normal and superconducting properties of a PbTe/Pb heterostructure. We resolve a proximity-induced superconducting gap on the PbTe side. The hybridization between PbTe and Pb causes the emergence of a soft Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconducting gap. We compute the anomalous charge density in real space, estimating its decay length and showing that the pairing potential is anisotropic, which is a necessary condition for unconventional superconductivity. Contrary to the models that predict Majorana zero modes in these interfaces, we find a significantly large Schottky barrier in the normal state preventing the emergence of zero modes. Our findings strengthen the understanding of the physics governing PbTe/Pb hybrid devices and their viability for Majorana zero modes applications.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Physics-Informed Neural Operators: Enhancing Operator Learning from Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have shown great potential in surrogate modeling. However, training a well-performing neural operator typically requires a substantial amount of data, which can pose a major challenge in complex applications. In such scenarios, detailed physical knowledge can be unavailable or difficult to obtain, and collecting extensive data is often prohibitively expensive. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Pseudo Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PPI-NO) framework. PPI-NO constructs a surrogate physics system for the target system using partial differential equations (PDEs) derived from simple, rudimentary physics principles, such as basic differential operators. This surrogate system is coupled with a neural operator model, using an alternating update and learning process to iteratively enhance the model's predictive power. While the physics derived via PPI-NO may not mirror the ground-truth underlying physical laws -- hence the term ``pseudo physics'' -- this approach significantly improves the accuracy of standard operator learning models in data-scarce scenarios, which is evidenced by extensive evaluations across five benchmark tasks and a fatigue modeling application.</description>

Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression offers a promising route toward interpretable machine learning, yet existing methods suffer from poor predictability and computational intractability when exploring large expression spaces. I introduce GoodRegressor, a general-purpose C++-based framework that resolves these limitations while preserving full physical interpretability. By combining hierarchical descriptor construction, interaction discovery, nonlinear transformations, statistically rigorous model selection, and stacking ensemble, GoodRegressor efficiently explores symbolic model spaces such as $1.44 \times 10^{457}$, $5.99 \times 10^{124}$, and $4.20 \times 10^{430}$ possible expressions for oxygen-ion conductors, NASICONs, and superconducting oxides, respectively. Across these systems, it achieves predictive performance that is comparable to or exceeds that of state-of-the-art black-box models and consistently outperforms existing white-box symbolic regression methods. The resulting expressions provide physical insights; for example, in the oxygen-ion conductor problem, they elucidate oxygen-ion transport in terms of the coordination environment and lattice flexibility. Independent ensemble runs yield nearly identical regressed values and the identical top-ranked candidate, demonstrating high reproducibility. With scalability up to $10^{4392}$ choices without interaction terms, GoodRegressor provides a foundation for general-purpose interpretable machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable 2D glasses and packings explained by local centrosymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent numerical data by Bolton-Lum \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 136, 058201 (2026)], we demonstrate that ideal ultrastable glasses in the athermal limit (or ultrastable ideal 2D disk packings) possess a remarkably high degree of local centrosymmetry. In particular, we find that the inversion-symmetry order parameter for local force transmission introduced in Milkus and Zaccone, [Phys. Rev. 93, 094204 (2016)], is as high as $F_{IS}= 0.93546$, to be compared with $F_{IS}=1$ for perfect centrosymmetric crystals free of defects, and with $F_{IS} \sim 0.3-0.5$ for standard random packings. This observation provides a clear, natural explanation for the ultra-high shear modulus of ideal packings and ideal glasses, because the high centrosymmetry prevents non-affine relaxations which decrease the shear modulus. The same mechanism explains the absence of boson peak-like soft vibrational modes. These results also confirm what was found previous work, i.e. that the bond-orientational order parameter is a very poor correlator for the vibrational and mechanical</description>
