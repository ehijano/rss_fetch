      <title>Strong primeness for equivalence relations arising from Zariski dense subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that orbit equivalence relations arising from essentially free ergodic probability measure preserving actions of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of simple algebraic groups are strongly prime. As a consequence, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of a prime factorization for orbit equivalence relations arising from direct products of higher rank lattices. This extends and strengthens Zimmer's primeness result for equivalence relations arising from actions of lattices in simple Lie groups. The proof of our main result relies on a combination of ergodic theory of algebraic group actions and Popa's intertwining theory for equivalence relations.</description>

      <title>Folding Entropy for Extended Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of folding entropy emerges from Ruelle's studies of entropy production in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and is a significant notion to understand the complexities of non-invertible dynamical systems. The metric entropy (Kolmogorov-Sinai) is central in Ornstein's theory of Bernoulli shifts - it is a complete invariant for such maps. In this article we consider zip shift spaces, which extends the bilateral symbolic shift into a two-alphabet symbolic dynamical system and are ergodic and mixing systems with a chaotic behavior. A class of examples of maps isomophically mod 0 to zip shifts are the n-to-1 baker's maps, which represents a non-invertible model of deterministic chaos. We calculate the metric and folding entropies of a generic zip shift system, and relate the two. For the metric entropy, we find the general form for cylinder sets pulled-back by the shift dynamics, and use the Kolmogorov-Sinai theorem to calculate the metric entropy of the zip shift system. For the folding entropy, we find the disintegration of the zip shift measure relative to the pullback of the atomic partition, and relate it to the zip shift measure in a simple formula.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of a Discrete Mosquito Model with Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamical behavior of a two-dimensional discrete mosquito model incorporating an Allee effect. We analyze the system's trajectory comprehensively, examining both local and global dynamics. Our analysis begins by establishing the invariance of the positive trajectory within the first quadrant. We then investigate the existence of fixed points within this region. Following this, we perform a stability analysis to determine both local and global asymptotic stability of the identified fixed points. Finally, we validate the effectiveness and applicability of our theoretical results through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Passivity Tools for Hybrid Learning Rules in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has pioneered the use of system-theoretic passivity to study equilibrium stability for the dynamics of noncooperative strategic interactions in large populations of learning agents. In this and related works, the stability analysis leverages knowledge that certain ``canonical'' classes of learning rules used to model the agents' strategic behaviors satisfy a passivity condition known as $\delta$-passivity. In this paper, we consider that agents exhibit learning behaviors that do not align with a canonical class. Specifically, we focus on characterizing $\delta$-passivity for hybrid learning rules that combine elements from canonical classes. Our analysis also introduces and uses a more general version of $\delta$-passivity, which, for the first time, can handle discontinuous learning rules, including those showing best-response behaviors. We state and prove theorems establishing $\delta$-passivity for two broad convex cones of hybrid learning rules. These cones can merge into a larger one preserving $\delta$-passivity in scenarios limited to two strategies. In our proofs, we establish intermediate facts that are significant on their own and could potentially be used to further generalize our work. We illustrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Clustering in pure-attention hardmax transformers and its role in sentiment analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are extremely successful machine learning models whose mathematical properties remain poorly understood. Here, we rigorously characterize the behavior of transformers with hardmax self-attention and normalization sublayers as the number of layers tends to infinity. By viewing such transformers as discrete-time dynamical systems describing the evolution of points in a Euclidean space, and thanks to a geometric interpretation of the self-attention mechanism based on hyperplane separation, we show that the transformer inputs asymptotically converge to a clustered equilibrium determined by special points called leaders. We then leverage this theoretical understanding to solve sentiment analysis problems from language processing using a fully interpretable transformer model, which effectively captures `context' by clustering meaningless words around leader words carrying the most meaning. Finally, we outline remaining challenges to bridge the gap between the mathematical analysis of transformers and their real-life implementation.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal theoretical model of instabilities in swirling flows occurring in nature or industrial processes is developed. This model encompasses various open and confined flows including spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow, which results from the combination of differential rotation and baroclinic convection due to radial heating and natural gravity. Utilizing short-wavelength local analysis, the model generalizes previous results from numerical simulations and linear stability analysis of specific flows. A general criterion for instability is derived, incorporating viscous dissipation and thermal diffusion, thereby extending and uniting existing criteria (Rayleigh for centrifugally-driven flows, L\"udwieg-Eckhoff-Leibovich-Stewartson for isothermal spiraling flows, and Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke for non-isothermal azimuthal flows).</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of reaction-diffusion PDEs via neural operator-approximated gain kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</description>

Abstract: We compute the groupoid homology for the ample groupoids associated with algebraic actions from rings of algebraic integers and integral dynamics. We derive results for the homology of the topological full groups associated with rings of algebraic integers, and we use our groupoid homology calculation to compute the K-theory for ring C*-algebras of rings of algebraic integers, recovering the results of Cuntz and Li and of Li and L\"uck without using Cuntz--Li duality. Moreover, we compute the K-theory for C*-algebras attached to integral dynamics, resolving the conjecture by Barlak, Omland, and Stammeier in full generality.</description>

Abstract: We establish the Anderson localization and exponential dynamical localization for a class of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with bounded or unbounded Lipschitz monotone potentials via multi-scale analysis based on Rellich function analysis in the perturbative regime. We show that at each scale, the resonant Rellich function uniformly inherits the Lipschitz monotonicity property of the potential via a novel Schur complement argument.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and laminarity of the Green currents for H\'enon-like maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under a natural assumption on the dynamical degrees, we prove that the Green currents associated to any H\'enon-like map in any dimension have H\"older continuous super-potentials, i.e., give H\"older continuous linear functionals on suitable spaces of forms and currents. As a consequence, the unique measure of maximal entropy is the Monge-Amp\`ere of a H\"older continuous plurisubharmonic function and has strictly positive Hausdorff dimension. Under the same assumptions, we also prove that the Green currents are woven. When they are of bidegree $(1,1)$, they are laminar. In particular, our results generalize results known until now only in algebraic settings, or in dimension 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjecture of the existence and the uniqueness of the strictly convex quadrilateral central configuration for the Newtonian 4-body problem is one of the most-talked open problems in the study of the classical n-body problems in celestial mechanics. MacMillan and Bartky first gave its general existence in the 1930s and a particular case for its uniqueness. Still, the general case has yet to be solved perfectly since it was considered by Sim'{o} and Yoccoz in the 1980s and was first mentioned by Albouy and Fu in 2008 in the formal publication. Using coordinates of mutual distances and Morse's critical point theory, we give the (at most) uniqueness of the planar strictly convex 4-body central configuration when the angle of one pair of the opposite sides is given.</description>

      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>A refractory density approach to a multi-scale SEIRS epidemic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-scale modeling framework for infectious disease spreading, borrowing ideas and modeling tools from the so-called Refractory Density (RD) approach. We introduce a microscopic model that describes the probability of infection for a single individual and the evolution of the disease within their body. From the individual-level description, we then present the corresponding population-level model of epidemic spreading on the mesoscopic and macroscopic scale. We conclude with numerical illustrations taking into account either a white Gaussian noise or an escape noise to showcase the potential of our approach in producing both transient and asymptotic complex dynamics as well as finite-size fluctuations consistently across multiple scales. A comparison with the epidemiology of coronaviruses is also given to corroborate the qualitative relevance of our new approach.</description>

      <title>Equivariant embedding of finite-dimensional dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an equivariant version of the classical Menger-Nobeling theorem regarding topological embeddings: Whenever a group $G$ acts on a finite-dimensional compact metric space $X$, a generic continuous equivariant function from $X$ into $([0,1]^r)^G$ is a topological embedding, provided that for every positive integer $N$ the space of points in $X$ with orbit size at most $N$ has topological dimension strictly less than $\frac{rN}{2}$. We emphasize that the result imposes no restrictions whatsoever on the acting group $G$ (beyond the existence of an action on a finite-dimensional space). Moreover, if $G$ is finitely generated then there exists a finite subset $F\subset G$ so that for a generic continuous map $h:X\to [0,1]^{r}$, the map $h^{F}:X\to ([0,1]^{r})^{F}$ given by $x\mapsto (f(gx))_{g\in F}$ is an embedding. This constitutes a generalization of the Takens delay embedding theorem into the topological category.</description>

Abstract: To simplify mathematical models of disease spread, we often assume equal contact rates among hosts, but real-world scenarios differ. Network-based frameworks help capture these complexities and structural variations in actual systems.
  We explore two scenarios involving Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics in interconnected networks. First, we study how the epidemic threshold of a contact network changes when coupled with another network, holding infection strength constant. Our model treats both contact networks and interconnections generically. We depict the epidemic threshold curve for interconnected networks, accounting for initial infection in either or both networks. If normalized infection strengths surpass this threshold curve, the disease spreads; below it, it does not, regardless of interconnection level.
  In the second scenario, we investigate disease spillover, where a novel host population network is affected by a reservoir network. A clear phase transition occurs when the number of links or inter-network infection rate exceeds a threshold while other parameters remain fixed. Spillover exhibits two regimes: major and minor, based on interpopulation links and inter-network infection strength. High spillover probability occurs in the major region and low in the minor. The threshold link count varies with network topology for similar infected numbers in the reservoir network.
  In sum, our work enhances understanding of SIR dynamics in interconnected networks, offering insights into epidemic behavior in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-based sufficient conditions for indistinguishability of linear compartmental models</title>

Abstract: An important problem in biological modeling is choosing the right model. Given experimental data, one is supposed to find the best mathematical representation to describe the real-world phenomena. However, there may not be a unique model representing that real-world phenomena. Two distinct models could yield the same exact dynamics. In this case, these models are called indistinguishable. In this work, we consider the indistinguishability problem for linear compartmental models, which are used in many areas, such as pharmacokinetics, physiology, cell biology, toxicology, and ecology. We exhibit sufficient conditions for indistinguishability for models with a certain graph structure: paths from input to output with "detours". The benefit of applying our results is that indistinguishability can be proven using only the graph structure of the models, without the use of any symbolic computation. This can be very helpful for medium-to-large sized linear compartmental models. These are the first sufficient conditions for indistinguishability of linear compartmental models based on graph structure alone, as previously only necessary conditions for indistinguishability of linear compartmental models existed based on graph structure alone. We prove our results by showing that the indistinguishable models are the same up to a renaming of parameters, which we call permutation indistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Group measure space construction, ergodicity and $W^\ast$-rigidity for stable random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work discovers a novel link between probability theory (of stable random fields) and von Neumann algebras. It is established that the group measure space construction corresponding to a minimal representation is an invariant of a stationary symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random field indexed by any countable group $G$. When $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$, we characterize ergodicity (and also absolute non-ergodicity) of stationary S$\alpha$S fields in terms of the central decomposition of this crossed product von Neumann algebra coming from any (not necessarily minimal) Rosinski representation. This shows that ergodicity (or the complete absence of it) is a $W^\ast$-rigid property (in a suitable sense) for this class of fields. All our results have analogues for stationary max-stable random fields as well.</description>

      <title>On the symplectic geometry of $A_k$ singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete symplectic classification of $A_k$ Hamiltonians on $\mathbb R^2$, in the analytic and smooth categories. Precisely, consider the pair $(H, \omega)$ consisting of a Hamiltonian and a symplectic structure on $\mathbb R^2$ such that $H$ has an $A_{k-1}$ singularity at the origin with $k\geq 2$. We classify such pairs near the origin, up to fiberwise symplectomorphisms, and up to $H$-preserving symplectomorphisms. The classification is obtained by bringing the pair $(H, \omega)$ to a symplectic normal form $$\big(H = \xi^2 \pm x^k, \ \omega = d (f d \xi)\big), \quad f = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x^i f_i(x^k),$$ modulo some relations which are explicitly given. We also show that the group of $H$-preserving symplectomorphisms of an $A_{k-1}$ singularity for $k$ odd consists of symplectomorphisms that can be included into a $C^\infty$-smooth (resp., real-analytic) $H$-preserving flow, whereas for $k$ even with $k \ge 4$ the same is true modulo the $\mathbb Z_2$-subgroup generated by the involution $Inv(x,\xi) = (-x,-\xi)$. The paper is concluded with a brief discussion of the conjecture that the symplectic invariants of $A_{k-1}$ singularities are spectrally determined.</description>

      <title>Resonance and Weak Chaos in Quasiperiodically-Forced Circle Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a numerical technique, the weighted Birkhoff average (WBA) to distinguish between four categories of dynamics for quasiperiodically-forced circle maps. Regular dynamics can be classified by rotation vectors, and these can be rapidly computed to machine precision using the WBA. Regular orbits can be resonant or incommensurate and we distinguish between these by computing their "resonance order." When the dynamics is chaotic the WBA converges slowly. Such orbits can be strongly chaotic, when they have a positive Lyapunov exponent or weakly chaotic, when the maximal Lyapunov exponent is zero. The latter correspond to the strange nonchaotic attractors (SNA) that have been observed in quasiperiodically-forced circle maps beginning with the models introduced by Ding, Grebogi, and Ott. The WBA provides a new technique to find SNAs, and allows us to accurately compute the proportions of each of the four orbit types as a function of map parameters.</description>

      <title>Periodic localized traveling waves in the two-dimensional suspension bridge equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the dynamics generated by the suspension bridge equation, traveling waves are an essential feature. The existing literature focuses primarily on the idealized one-dimensional case, while traveling structures in two spatial dimensions have only been studied via numerical simulations. We use computer-assisted proof methods based on a Newton-Kantorovich type argument to find and prove periodic localized traveling waves in two dimensions. The main obstacle is the exponential nonlinearity in combination with the resulting large amplitude of the localized waves. Our analysis hinges on establishing computable bounds to control the aliasing error in the computed Fourier coefficients. This leads to existence proofs of different traveling wave solutions, accompanied by small, explicit, rigorous bounds on the deficiency of numerical approximations. This approach is directly extendable to other wave equation models and elliptic partial differential equations with analytic nonlinearities, in two as well as in higher dimensions.</description>
