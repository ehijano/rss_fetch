      <title>Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting for versatile longitudinal diagnostics at the MAX IV Laboratory storage rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise diagnostic on the electron beam parameters is a very valuable tool and essential in the operation of synchrotron light sources. One possible option is to employ the emitted synchrotron radiation for non-destructive measurements. A tool, which has been used in many ring based synchrotron light sources is Time-Correlated Single-Photon Counting (TCSPC). It allows to measure the arrival time distribution of the emitted photons and by that reveals the filling pattern, i.e., the charge distribution onto the electron bunches stored in the storage ring. At MAX IV, two TCSPC setups were installed and the analysis was developed further to also allow for the measurement of the longitudinal profiles of the individual bunches. The analysis is available as a Tango device in the accelerator control system and continuously provides, for example, the bunch length of each bunch as well as the bunch profiles and phases. This improved the diagnostic capabilities significantly, for example, in the presence of Landau cavities, which are becoming increasingly more common in new fourth-generation synchrotron light sources.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic excitations in graphene layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of fast charged particles with graphene layers can generate electromagnetic modes. This wake effect has been recently proposed for short-wavelength, high-gradient particle acceleration and for obtaining brilliant radiation sources. In this study, the excitation of wakefields produced by a point-like charged particle moving parallel to a multilayer graphene array (which may be supported by an insulated substrate) is studied using the linearized hydrodynamic theory. General expressions for the excited longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been derived. The dependencies of the wakefields on the positions of the layers and the substrate, the velocity and the surface density have been extensively analyzed. This study provides a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena underlying plasmonic excitations in graphene layers, paving the way for potential applications of these structures in particle acceleration, nanotechnology and materials science.</description>

      <title>Magnetron Stabilization using Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unstable magnetron RF source for driving an accelerator cavity at high power is stabilized using ferroelectric fast reactive tuning. The magnetron output is converted to a selected reference frequency with negligible insertion loss. The conversion is achieved by modulating the magnetron's frequency, such that the modulation converts the magnetron's output to the exact reference frequency. The method also allows simultaneous amplitude and phase control.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian states in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau states of electrons with orbital angular momentum in magnetic fields are important in the quantum theories of metals and of synchrotron radiation at storage rings, in relativistic astrophysics of neutron stars, and in many other areas. In realistic scenarios, electrons are often born inside the field or injected from a field-free region, requiring nonstationary quantum states to account for boundary or initial conditions. This study presents nonstationary Laguerre-Gaussian (NSLG) states in a longitudinal magnetic field, characterizing vortex electrons after their transfer from vacuum to the field. Comparisons with Landau states and calculations of observables such as mean energy and r.m.s. radius show that the r.m.s. radius of the electron packet in the NSLG state oscillates in time around a significantly larger value than that of the Landau state. This quantum effect of oscillations is due to boundary conditions and can potentially be observed in various problems, particularly when using magnetic lenses of electron microscopes and linear accelerators. Analogies are drawn between a quantum wave packet and a classical beam of many particles in phase space, including the calculation of mean emittance of the NSLG state as a measure of their quantum nature.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>
