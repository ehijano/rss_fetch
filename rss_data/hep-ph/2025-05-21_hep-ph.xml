      <title>Resumming transverse observables for NNLO+PS matching in GENEVA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the use of higher-order resummation for transverse observables to achieve NNLO+PS matching within the GENEVA framework. In particular, we embed $q_T$ resummation for colour-singlet production at N$^3$LL obtained via soft-collinear effective theory and implemented in the library SCETlib within GENEVA. We also study for the first time the use of the generalised $N$-jettiness variable in parton shower matching, and achieve the resummation of the one-jettiness defined with transverse measures up to NLL$'$ accuracy. As a case study, we use these resummed calculations to construct a GENEVA NNLO+PS generator for Higgs boson production in heavy-quark annihilation (with beauty or charm-quarks in the initial state). The use of transverse measures facilitates the matching to showers ordered in transverse momentum, and opens the door to possible future extensions of this approach to the production of colour singlets in association with final-state jets.</description>

      <title>Radiative neutrino mass models from non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply non-invertible selection rules coming from a fusion algebra to radiative neutrino mass models where fields are labeled by the elements in the algebra. Since non-invertible selection rules only hold at tree level, radiative corrections naturally explain the origin of tiny neutrino masses. Furthermore, a remnant symmetry of the fusion algebra protects the stability of dark matter, which is conventionally imposed in radiative neutrino models. We also find that interesting neutrino mass textures are realized by assigning fields to family-dependent elements in the algebra.</description>

      <title>Status of $D_s^+\to\phi\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decay with chiral-odd $\phi$-meson LCDA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twist-2 distribution amplitude of the $\phi$-meson has attracted considerable interest due to its unique properties. In this work, we construct the transverse leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) $\phi_{2;\phi}^\bot(x,\mu_0)$ of the $\phi$-meson using the light-cone harmonic oscillator (LCHO) model, in which a parameter $B_{2;\phi}^\bot$ dominantly control its longitudinal distribution. To explicitly isolate different twist contributions, we employ the right-handed chiral correlator for the QCD light-cone sum rules (LCSR) calculation of $D_s^+\to\phi$ decays, and further, we get the branching fraction, $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to \phi e^+\nu_e )= (2.271_{-0.243}^{+0.291})\times 10^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to \phi \mu^+\nu_\mu )=(2.250_{-0.240}^{+0.287})\times 10^{-2}$, where errors are squared average of the mentioned error sources. Furthermore, we have extracted the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{cs}|=0.975_{-0.066}^{+0.067}$ with improved precision through the analysis. Finally, we calculated the polarization parameter and asymmetry parameter for the $D_s^+\to\phi$ decays.</description>

      <title>Probing the low mass pseudoscalar in flipped Two Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenology of the flipped two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) is relatively less explored so far, as compared to the other, commonly discussed, types. It is found that this scenario, like several others, admits of a light neutral pseudoscalar $A$ in the mass range 20 - 60 GeV, consistently with all current experimental data and theoretical constraints. However, the fact that such a pseudoscalar decays overwhelmingly into a $b\bar{b}$ pair makes its identification at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) a challenging task. After identifying the region of the flipped 2HDM parameter space yielding a light pseudoscalar, we identify a useful search channel in the process $pp \rightarrow A Z(Z^{*}) \rightarrow b\bar{b} \ell^+ \ell^-$. A cut-based analysis, followed by one based on Boosted Decision Trees, shows that the light-$A$ scenario in flipped 2HDM should be detectable with rather high statistical significance at the high-luminosity LHC run, even after including systematic uncertainties. Furthermore, part of the parameter space, especially around $m_A = 30 - 40$ GeV is amenable to detection at the discovery level within Run-2 itself.</description>

      <title>$\phi \to 3\pi$ and $\phi\pi^{0}$ transition form factor from Khuri-Treiman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the $\phi \to 3\pi$ decay and the $\phi \to \pi^0 \gamma^\ast$ transition form factor, utilizing the Khuri-Treiman formalism to account for analyticity, crossing, and unitarity. Using once-subtracted dispersion relations, we perform a simultaneous fit to the $\phi \to 3\pi$ Dalitz plot distribution and the $\phi \to \pi^0 \gamma^\ast$ measurements from the KLOE collaboration, finding good agreement with these experimental data. These results reaffirm the applicability of the Khuri-Treiman approach in the analysis of three-body decays. An interesting result is that the subtraction constant appearing in the equations is similar to a sum rule expectation, in contrast to analogous studies of $\omega \to 3\pi$ decays and $\omega \to \pi^0 \gamma^\ast$, which shows significant deviations. Our results also provide a reasonable description of the trend of the transition form factor data from BaBar in the $e^{+}e^{-}\to\phi\pi^{0}$ scattering region. These intriguing theoretical differences between the decays of $\phi$ and $\omega$ could encourage further experimental measurements to assess the discrepancies and refine the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations on First-order phase transition through thermal fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we numerically present the possibility of the first-order phase transition occurring through the thermal fluctuation in the early universe. We find that when the temperature is slightly higher than the mass scale of the background field, the bubble-like field configurations appear proceeded by oscillons, which expand and collide to finish the phase transition. We provide the false vacuum decay rate and the accompanied gravitational waves. We also present the vacuum phase transition comparison of the quantum tunneling case and thermal fluctuation case.</description>

      <title>Novel constraints on $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Lambda}$ interactions using correlation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between baryons and antibaryons remains a fundamental topic in hadronic physics, particularly due to its potential to reveal exotic bound states such as baryonia. While the proton-antiproton system has been extensively studied, mainly via scattering experiments, interactions involving antihyperons, such as proton-antilambda and lambda-antilambda, are still poorly constrained due to limited experimental data. High-precision measurements of these systems, especially at low relative momentum, have recently become available through femtoscopic analyses in proton-proton collisions at the LHC.
  In this work, we extract for the first time the scattering parameters for the lambda-antilambda and proton-antilambda systems using correlation data measured by the ALICE experiment. Our aim is to investigate potential differences between the elastic and annihilation components of the interaction potential. We employ a novel analysis framework, iCATS (imaginary CATS), which solves the Schr\"odinger equation with complex optical potentials to model the strong final-state interactions in systems dominated by inelastic processes.
  Our results indicate distinct annihilation characteristics between the two systems, challenging the assumption of universal baryon-antibaryon dynamics. The extracted scattering amplitudes are compared with available production cross sections and invariant mass spectra. The consistency between femtoscopic constraints and other observables supports the use of this approach for future explorations of the baryon-antibaryon sector.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling Expansion of Gluodynamics on a Lattice under Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytic strong coupling expansion of the gluodynamics under a rotation with an angular velocity $\omega$ is reported. While the expansion is systematic, free from additional assumptions, the deconfinement temperature determined by the onset of the Polyakov loop expectation value decreases with the angular velocity up to $\omega^2$, opposite to the tendency found in numerical simulations. As a by-product, a simple formula is obtained for the $\omega^2$ coefficient of the deconfinement temperature shift in terms of the latent heat and the discontinuity of the moment of inertia at the transition without rotation. This formula is independent of the strong coupling and may benefit further investigation of the subject.</description>

      <title>Testing the nature of the $\Sigma^*(1430)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the feasibility of having the $\Sigma^*(1430)$ state, predicted within the chiral unitary approach and recently reported by the Belle Collaboration, as corresponding to a state of non-molecular nature. Starting from this assumption, since the state is observed in the $\pi \Lambda$ channel, we allow the coupling to this state and relate the coupling to $\bar K N$ and $\pi \Sigma$ using $SU(3)$ symmetry arguments. We find that it is possible to have such a state with negligible coupling to the molecular components with a bare mass of the state very close to the physical mass of the $\Sigma^*(1430)$. Yet, this has consequences on other observables, since the width obtained is extremely small and incompatible with the Belle observations, and it leads to abnormally large values of the $\bar K N$ effective range. Conversely, such mismatches do not appear for large values of the bare mass of the state, but in this case we observe that the state develops large molecular components. While one can rule out a largely non-molecular nature for this state, its properties and detailed nature will need further experimental developments which one can anticipate will be coming in the near future.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of the second shell $\Lambda_b$ and $\Xi_b$ bottom baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the radiative decays of the $\Lambda_b$ and $\Xi_b$ bottom baryons, which belong to the flavor anti-triplet ($\mathbf{\bar{3}}_{\rm F}$), within the constituent quark model formalism. The electromagnetic transitions are calculated from the second-shell states to both the ground and $P$-wave final states. These decays play a crucial role in confirming the existence of certain resonances. When strong decays are not allowed, the reconstruction of states relies on their electromagnetic decay channels. Moreover, electromagnetic decay widths are particularly useful for the identification of resonances when states have the same mass and total decay width. This study presents, for the first time, the calculation of electromagnetic decays for $D_\rho$-wave states, $\rho-\lambda$ mixed states, and $\rho$-mode radially excited states. Throughout our calculations, we account for uncertainties arising from both experimental and model-dependent errors.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Strangeness Tetraquarks in the Dynamical Diquark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical diquark model describes multiquark exotic hadrons in terms of diquark components nucleated by heavy quarks, and successfully explains multiple features of hidden-charm and -bottom exotics. Here we apply the model to the marginally heavy case of hidden-strange states to probe whether mesons near 2 GeV with peculiar properties, such as $\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and X(2370), are possible tetraquark candidates. We calculate spin-multiplet average masses using potentials obtained through lattice simulations and quark models, and we also describe the detailed spectra of the expected multiplets as a diagnostic to discern the nature of future hadrons likely to be discovered in this mass region by experiments at facilities such as BESIII, JLab, and the EIC.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Cosmic Walls with Paleo Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paleo detectors are emerging dark matter detection technology that exploits ancient minerals as passive, time-integrated detectors. Unlike conventional real-time experiments, they search for permanent damage tracks-typically tens of nanometers to micrometers long-left in crystal lattices by rare particle interactions, most notably dark matter induced nuclear recoils accumulated over millions to billions of years. In this paper I propose a direct detection strategy for cosmic walls-either bubble walls produced by a late-time first-order phase transition or domain walls in a scaling regime-using paleo detectors as the target medium. Because the cosmic wall is expected to traverse Earth at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time(s) in cosmic history, an ancient, continuously exposed detector is the only feasible way to observe it directly. By calculating the target recoils, I find that the smoking-gun signature would be parallel damage tracks found worldwide in minerals older than the wall-crossing epoch. I derive the limit on the wall-target coupling by assuming that a wall passed through the Earth within the last 0.5 Gyr. I also mention a novel indirect detection of ultra-relativistic cosmic walls by noting the induced cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Rescuing 331 bileptons from the Landau pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the particles being searched for at the LHC beyond the Standard Model are bileptons, which are doubly charged gauge bosons. Bileptons are predicted by several Standard Model extensions, including the so-called 331 models with $\beta = \sqrt 3$. The minimal formulation of these models is generally plagued by a "low energy" Landau pole, which can undermine current predictions for TeV-scale bileptons. We analyze this issue and investigate the possibility to shift the Landau pole at higher energy scales by extending the troublesome minimal 331 models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, I present a composite Higgs model in which the flavour hierarchies between the third and light families emerge naturally. In particular, CKM mixing angles turn out to be suppressed while PMNS matrix remains anarchic. This flavour structure arises as a consequence of the extended non-universal gauge symmetry of the model and the electroweak charges of the fundamental fermions of the new composite sector that realises the Higgs boson as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. The model is described in detail in arXiv:2412.14243.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Quantum Violation of Macrorealism in Large-spin Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how macroscopic classical behavior emerges from a quantum underpinning with counterintuitive characteristics. The deviation from classical standpoint of a quantum system's temporal correlations is measured via the entropic Leggett-Garg inequality. We introduce a geometric framework to derive entropic Leggett-Garg inequalities involving higher-order correlations, and analyze their asymptotic behavior in large-spin systems by employing the WKB approximation. Results show that, for maximally mixed states, quantum violations converge to a constant in the macroscopic limit, rather than growing logarithmically with the system's entropy, indicating that macroscopic realism increasingly dominates as the number of energy levels expands. However, exceptions arise with certain parameter settings, where the semiclassical approximation breaks down entirely, enabling inequalities to exhibit maximal quantum violation, thus revealing that quantum and classical descriptions remain incompatible even on a macroscopic scale. It is noteworthy this violation originates exclusively from the temporal correlations of a single system, distinguishing it from macroscopic quantum phenomena observed in many-body systems such as superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a formalism for coupling a bosonic Continuous-Spin field to familiar spin-1/2 matter. To do this, we describe the matter using the supersymmetric worldline formalism. We construct currents that are local functions of worldline kinematics, and respect both the worldline supersymmetry and the conservation condition required for consistent couplings to Abelian CSP fields. As the spin Casimir $\rho$ of the CSP vanishes, the interactions reduce to that of familiar QED in one case, and to a Yukawa interaction with a spin-1/2 fermion in another case. Our formalism is applicable to computing deviations from QED if the photon is a CSP, thereby enabling a range of phenomenological studies.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Time Approximation for a multi-species relativistic gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize a recent prescription for the relaxation time approximation for the relativistic Boltzmann equation for systems with multiple particle species at finite temperature. This is performed by adding counter-terms to the traditional Anderson-Witting ansatz for each particle species. Our approach allows for the use of momentum-dependent relaxation times and the obedience of local conservation laws regardless of the definition of the local equilibrium state. As an application, we derive the first order Chapman-Enskog corrections to the equilibrium distribution and display results for the hadron-resonance gas. We also demonstrate that our collision term ansatz obeys the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study linear relations between color-ordered all-plus amplitudes at one loop in Yang--Mills theory. We show that on general grounds, there are $(n-1)!/2-2$ relations for $n\ge 5$, leaving only two independent color-ordered amplitudes. We present two complementary approaches to finding such relations: one using numerical linear algebra and the other using syzygies in computational algebraic geometry. We obtain explicit forms for all relations through $n=7$. We also study relations for the tree-level MHV amplitudes through $n=8$. The latter relations include the well-known color and Bern--Carrasco--Johansson identities.</description>

      <title>Shapes and orientations of massive halos in the statistically anisotropic universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how statistical anisotropy (SA) in matter distributions affects the shapes and orientations of cluster-sized halos, using cosmological $N$-body simulations that incorporate SA. While the three-dimensional halo shape parameters show little dependence on SA, we find that halo orientations are significantly influenced, with halos tending to align either perpendicular or parallel to the SA direction. This SA-induced alignment becomes more prominent for more massive halos. Our findings suggest that observational measurements of projected halo shapes, such as those derived from galaxy cluster-galaxy lensing, could provide a novel probe of SA in the universe.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <title>Impact of general relativistic accretion on primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that general relativistic corrections to the accretion of relativistic matter onto primordial black holes (PBHs) can significantly enhance their mass growth during the early Universe. Contrary to previous Newtonian treatments, our analysis reveals that PBH masses can increase by an order of magnitude before evaporation, leading to substantial modifications of their lifetime and cosmological imprints. We quantify the resulting shifts in the minimum PBH mass constrained by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), the revised lower bound for PBHs surviving today, and the dark matter parameter space allowed by PBH evaporation. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced accretion alters the high-frequency gravitational wave spectrum from PBH evaporation, potentially within the reach of future detectors. Our results provide a comprehensive, relativistically consistent framework to delineate the role of PBHs in early-universe cosmology and dark matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in sterile neutrino dark matter in a feebly gauged $B-L$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ model and examine the situation where the sterile neutrino is a dark matter candidate produced by the freeze-in mechanism. In our model, the dark matter $N$ is mainly produced by the decay of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scalar boson $\phi$. We point out that the on-shell production of $\phi$ through annihilation of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson $Z'$ plays an important role. We find that the single production of $Z'$ from the gluon bath in the early Universe can become the main production modes for $Z'$ in some parameter regions. To prevent $N$ from being overproduced, we show that the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge coupling constant $g_{B-L}$ must be as small as $10^{-16}$--$10^{-10}$. We also consider the case where the decay of $\phi$ into $N$ is kinematically forbidden. In this case, $N$ is generated by the scattering of $Z'$ and the $g_{B-L}$ takes values of $10^{-10}$--$10^{-6}$, which can be explored in collider experiments like FASER and SHiP.</description>

      <title>Accelerated cosmic expansion, mass creation, and the QCD axion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism in which the current acceleration of cosmic expansion is driven by continuous creation of energy density $\rho_b$ for a certain field $\varphi_b$. We accordingly modify Einstein equation, derive modified Friedmann equations and analyze the regimes in which cosmic acceleration occurs. The creation process requires $\rho_b\neq 0$ as initial condition, which we enforce by identifying $\varphi_b$ with the axion of a hidden gauge group that confined in recent cosmological times, leading to a level crossing between $\varphi_b$ and the QCD axion, which is assumed to comprise dark matter. The conversion of a small fraction of QCD axions into $\varphi_b$ shortly before matter-dark energy equality generates the initial $\rho_b$ needed to trigger the creation process and offers a solution to the coincidence puzzle.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Large quark mass Euler-Heisenberg type action for QCD with quark sources and its Abelian limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quark determinant in the presence of a background gluon field is calculated in a large quark mass approach within a derivative expansion by considering quark sources. The resulting low-energy QCD Effective Field Theory (EFT) is valid for non-homogeneous fields and it presents, besides the usual Euler-Heisenberg type gluon self-interactions, different types of corrections to the minimal quark-gluon interaction among which there are several imaginary terms. The Abelian limit of this effective action, i.e. an expanded Euler-Heisenberg effective action with fermion sources, is also found and it is shown to contain, therefore, corrections to the fermion-photon interactions, including imaginary terms. Different resulting properties are calculated such as: their contributions to the energy-momentum tensor and its trace, the Poynting vector, the chromo-electric permittivity and chromo-magnetic permeability. Conditions for these quantities, as well as for the corresponding Abelian limits, to be real are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Probing a $Z'$ gauge boson via neutrino trident scattering in the Forward Physics Facility at the LHC and FCC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of neutrino physics at the Large Hadron Collider is already a reality, and a broad neutrino physics program is expected to be developed in forthcoming years at the Forward Physics Facility (FPF). In particular, the neutrino trident scattering process, which is a rare Standard Model process, is expected to be observed for the first time with a statistical significance of $5\sigma$ using the FASER$\nu$2 detector. Moreover, similar studies are expected to be performed in the proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC). Such perspectives motivate the investigation of the impact of New Physics on the predictions for the corresponding number of events. In this letter, we consider the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, which predicts an additional massive neutral gauge boson, $Z'$, that couples to neutrino and charged leptons of the second and third families, and estimate the production of a dimuon system in the neutrino trident scattering at the FASER$\nu$2 assuming different models for the incoming neutrino flux at the LHC and FCC energies. We derive the associated sensitivity and demonstrate that the FPF@LHC is not able to improve the current bounds on the $L_\mu - L_\tau$ model, while a future measurement of the dimuons produced in neutrino trident events in the FPF@FCC will extend the coverage of the parameter space in comparison to previous experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves of GUT Phase Transition during Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GUT phase transition is generally considered unobservable due to its ultra-high energy scale, and the monopole problem associated with GUT phase transition is one motivation of inflation. We propose that if a first-order GUT phase transition happens during inflation, the induced gravitational waves (GWs) are redshifted and deformed, and might be observed today in GW observatories. We review the formalism of inflated GWs and derive the general deformation function between inflated and uninflated GW spectra in the instant-source or transitory-source application. It is valid for any e-folding number of instant or transitory source. Applying the formalism to GUT phase transition, we find that the e-folding number at 15 or 25 can shift the GWs to 10 Hz or mHz hands, respectively, which might be tested in the future ground-based or space-based interferometers. We further generalise the discussion to inflated GWs via phase transition below the GUT scale. It is worth mentioning that, due to the deformation of the spectrum, the peak of inflated GWs is not simply a redshift of the peak of uninflated GWs.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions based on a linear Boltzmann transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) of $B_c$ mesons in high-energy nuclear collisions provides a novel probe of heavy quark interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Based on a linear Boltzmann transport model that incorporates both Yukawa and string types of interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP, we study the production and evolution of heavy quarks and $B_c$ mesons within the same framework. A $B_c$ bound state dissociates while one of its constituent heavy quarks scatters with the QGP with momentum transfer greater than its binding energy. The medium-modified charm and bottom quarks can recombine into $B_c$ mesons, and the medium-modified bottom quarks can also fragment to $B_c$ mesons. We find that most primordial $B_c$ mesons generated from the initial hard collisions dissociate inside the QGP. The production of $B_c$ mesons is primarily driven by the recombination mechanism at low transverse momentum and fragmentation at high transverse momentum. The string interaction dominates over the Yukawa interaction in the nuclear modification of $B_c$ mesons. The participant number dependence of the $B_c$ meson $R_\mathrm{AA}$ is determined by the complicated interplay between the heavy quark yield, energy loss, and the QGP volume. We obtain a reasonable description of the $R_\mathrm{AA}$ of $B_c$ mesons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, and provide predictions for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis of sub-leading colour corrections in perturbative QCD processes involving multiple soft gluon emissions. This necessitates going beyond the standard parton shower paradigm in order to incorporate interference effects and is accomplished using the CVolver program, which simulates parton showers at the amplitude level. We can compute cross-sections with full-colour precision and also broken down explicitly in terms of their $N_c$ dependence. In this paper, we focus on the jet cross-section with a veto of additional jets in some fixed region of phase-space, since this is sensitive to wide-angle, soft gluon radiation. We consider $Z \to q \bar{q}$, $H \to gg$, $q\bar{q} \to q\bar{q}$, $qg \to qg$, $gg \to gg$ and $ZZ \to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}$. We find that non-trivial sub-leading colour effects are generally important at the 5 -- 30\% level and much more than this for certain interference contributions. Remarkably, for this observable, we find that for all of the $t$-channel gluon exchange processes that we consider, the strictly leading colour approximation, which includes the replacement $C_F \to C_A/2$, is an excellent approximation to the full colour result (up to an overall colour factor).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density perturbations have recently been shown to lead to a novel effect in the freeze-out of heavy particles called "acoustically driven freeze-out." This leads to an enhancement in the yield in standard leptogenesis. We extend this calculation to include $2 \to 2$ washout processes in type-I leptogenesis and the Sommerfeld-enhanced $2 \to 2$ gauge annihilations in type-II and type-III leptogenesis. These CP conserving gauge annihilations suppress the yield of heavy particles sourcing the asymmetry. We show the acoustically driven freeze-out leads to novel enhancements in the baryon asymmetry in type-II and type-III leptogenesis, already in the weak washout regime, in contrast with type-I leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Production of $1^{-+}$ exotic charmonium-like states in electron-positron collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of observed charmonium-like states with the exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ has prompted us to investigate the production rates of the $1^{-+}$ $D\bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar D_1(2420)$ hadronic molecules, which we refer to as $\eta_{c1}$ and $\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$, respectively, in electron-positron collisions. Assuming a hadronic molecular nature for the vector charmonium-like states $\psi(4360)$ and $\psi(4415)$, we evaluate the radiative decay widths of $\psi(4360)\to\gamma\eta_{c1}$ and $\psi(4415)\to\gamma\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$. Using these decay widths, we estimate the cross sections for producing $\eta_{c1}$ and $\eta_{c1}^{\prime}$ in electron-positron annihilations, as well as the event numbers at the planned Super $\tau$-Charm Facility. Our results suggest that the ideal energy region for observing these states is around $4.44$ and $4.50$ GeV, just above the $D^* \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^*\bar D_2^*(2460)$ thresholds, respectively.</description>

      <title>Light quark energy loss in the flavor-dependent systems from holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the holographic model of finite-endpoint-momentum shooting string approach, we study the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks for the flavor-dependent systems with $N_f = 0$, $N_f = 2$, and $N_f = 2+1$ in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) framework. In particular, we investigate for the first time the impact of the flavor content of the strongly coupled QGP medium on the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks. It turns out that the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks is smallest for $N_f = 0$, and adding $u(d)$ quarks and $s$ quark in the system increases this energy loss. In addition, we found that the instantaneous energy loss in the strongly coupled plasma is minimal near the critical temperature, but it increases as the system moves away from the critical endpoint due to rising temperature or chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Examining scalar portal inelastic dark matter with lepton fixed target experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inelastic dark matter (DM) scenarios have attracted considerable attention in contemporary particles physics. In this study, we investigate the phenomenology of sub-GeV inelastic dark matter scenarios mediated by a lepton-specific scalar portal. By solving Boltzmann equations, we obtain a thermal target curves for the set of inelastic DM mass splitting in the sub-GeV mediator mass range. We study the discovery potential of lepton fixed-target experiments, particularly NA64e and NA64$\mu$, through their missing-energy signatures. Our analysis focuses on the $\phi$-strahlung process, $l N \to l N \phi$, followed by the invisible decay of the scalar mediator into Majorana dark matter particles $\phi \to \chi_1 \chi_2$, as a probe of the mediator coupling with charged leptons of Standard Model. For the viable parameters of the inelastic dark matter scenario, we derive the sensitivity projections for NA64e and NA64$\mu$, implying that boosted state $\chi_2$ decays visibly $\chi_2 \to \chi_1 e^+ e^-$ beyond the detector acceptance. Our results demonstrate the complementary roles of electron- and muon-beam experiments in exploring the sub-GeV inelastic dark matter sector mediated by the scalar portal.</description>

      <title>Probing millicharged particles with NA64$\mu$ and LDMX</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millicharged particles emerge as compelling candidates in numerous theoretically well-motivated extensions of the Standard Model. These hypothetical particles, characterized by an electric charge that is a small fraction of the elementary charge, have attracted significant attention in contemporary experimental physics. Their potential existence motivates dedicated search strategies across multiple experimental platforms, leveraging their distinctive electromagnetic interactions while evading conventional detection methods. In the present paper we estimated the projected sensitivity of fixed-target experiments - specifically NA64$\mu$ and LDMX - to the parameter space of millicharged particles. For the NA64$\mu$ experiment, with an anticipated muon flux of $\mbox{MOT}\simeq 10^{14}$, our analysis reveals a detectable mass window of $10~\mbox{MeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 150~\mbox{MeV}$ and charge parameter range $10^{-4} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 7\times 10^{-4}$. This sensitivity arises from the bremsstrahlung-like missing energy signature $\mu N \to \mu N \gamma^{*}( \to \chi \bar{\chi})$. Furthermore, we evaluate the discovery potential of the LDMX facility, considering its projected electron beam statistics ($\mbox{EOT}\simeq 2\times 10^{16}$) and energy ($E_{\rm e}\simeq 8~\mbox{GeV}$). Our results demonstrate that LDMX can probe heavier MCPs in the mass range $250~\mbox{MeV} \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim 400 ~\mbox{MeV}$, with sensitivities reaching $10^{-3} \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 1.5 \times 10^{-3}$. This parametric window can be accessible through the distinctive invisible decay channel $\rho \to \chi \bar{\chi}$, where $\rho$-meson photo-production $\gamma N \to N \rho$ plays a pivotal role.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of the quark model and the variational method, the bound states of four heavy quarks (tetraquarks) are investigated. The basis variational wave functions are chosen in the Gaussian form. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are calculated analytically. Numerical calculation of the energy levels of tetraquarks is performed using a program in the Matlab system. Hyperfine structure of the spectrum is calculated. To increase the accuracy of the calculation, relativistic corrections are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Neutrino Secret Interactions from Multi-messenger Neutrinos Scattering on C$\nu$B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new constraints on neutrino secret interactions ($\nu$SI) by studying high-energy neutrinos from well-known astrophysical sources, such as SN1987A, the blazars TXS $0506+056$ and PKS $0735+178$, the active galaxy NGC 1068, and KM3-230213A neutrino event. We extend existing limits by covering a previously unconstrained region of the mediator mass parameter space. Our analysis focuses on Dirac neutrinos interacting with a massive spin-one boson as they propagate through the Cosmic Neutrino Background. We consider both ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, deriving bounds on the $\nu$SI coupling constant across the full $\nu$SI mediator mass range. Our results obtained using analytical methods, demonstrate significant constraints on the $\nu$SI coupling in the low-mass mediator mass region for a given cutoff parameter.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg/s}$ (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim 20$ such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39\% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD calculation of the Compton amplitude subtraction function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Compton amplitude subtraction function is an essential component in work concerning both the proton radius puzzle and the proton-neutron mass difference. However, owing to the difficulty in determining the subtraction function, it remains a key source of uncertainty in these two contexts. Here, we use the Feynman-Hellmann method to determine this subtraction function directly from lattice QCD. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to control dominant discretisation artefacts for this calculation, eliminating a major source of systematic error. This calculation is performed for a range of hard momentum scales, and three different sets of gauge configurations for pion masses about 400 MeV. Our results show good agreement with continuum OPE expectations. As such, this work paves the way for model-independent and precise determinations of the subtraction function over a wide range of kinematics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Primordial Curvature Perturbations via Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict an enhancement of scalar perturbations at scales currently unconstrained by cosmological probes. These perturbations source gravitational waves (GWs) at second order in perturbation theory, leading to a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background. The LISA detector, sensitive to mHz GWs, will be able to constrain curvature perturbations in a new window corresponding to scales $k \in [10^{10}, 10^{14}] \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, difficult to probe otherwise. In this work, we forecast the capabilities of LISA to constrain the source of SIGWs using different approaches: i) agnostic, where the spectrum of curvature perturbations is binned in frequency space; ii) template-based, modeling the curvature power spectrum based on motivated classes of models; iii) ab initio, starting from first-principles model of inflation featuring an ultra-slow roll phase. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We also discuss the impact on the SIGW spectrum of non-standard thermal histories affecting the kernels of SIGW emission and non-Gaussianity in the statistics of the curvature perturbations. Finally, we propose simple tests to assess whether the signal is compatible with the SIGW hypothesis. The pipeline used is built into the SIGWAY code.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational waves from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of Spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry Breaking (SLSB) on Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) generated during inflation. The SLSB is induced by a time-like Bumblebee vector field which is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci tensor in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background. The power spectrum and GW amplitude are computed to investigate how Lorentz violation leaves observable imprints. We calculate the GW strain amplitude over frequencies $(10^{-10}~\mathrm{Hz}, 10^4~\mathrm{Hz})$, for a range of the dimensionless Lorentz-violating parameter, $ -10^{-3} \leq l \leq 10^{-4} $, which essentially comes from a slight sensitivity to the equation of state for dark energy. For positive $ l $ values, the amplitude of GW shows a mild suppression compared to the standard cosmological scenario $( l = 0) $. This effect could be observable with detectors like SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO. Conversely, negative $ l $ values amplify the GW amplitude, enhancing detectability by both SKA, $\mu$-Ares, and BBO, as well as by THEIA and DECIGO. Notably, the GW strain amplitude increases by an order of magnitude as $ l $ moves from 0 to $ -10^{-3} $, improving prospects for detection in high-sensitivity detectors like THEIA and DECIGO.</description>
