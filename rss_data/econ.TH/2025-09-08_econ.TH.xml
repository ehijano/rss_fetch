      <title>Intergroup cooperation and reputation for honesty in an OLG framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies an infinite-horizon framework in which two large populations of players are randomly matched to play a Prisoner's Dilemma. Each player lives for two consecutive periods: as a young player from one group, and then as an old player in the other group. Each population has a known fraction of honest types - individuals who always cooperate unless paired with a player who has been observed to defect against a cooperating partner in the past. Because such defections (i.e., breakdowns of trust) are publicly observed, any defector risks carrying a stigma into future interactions. We show that when the benefits from defection are sufficiently large, there exists an equilibrium in which an increase in the fraction of honest types can reduce the likelihood of cooperation. Moreover, we demonstrate that introducing imperfect public memory - allowing past misdeeds to be probabilistically "cleared" - does not enhance cooperation.</description>

      <title>Public Communication in Regime Change games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a regime change game in which the state and an opposition leader both observe the regime's true strength and may engage in costly communication by manipulating the mean of citizens' private signals. Each citizen then decides whether to attack the regime. From the perspective of both the state and the opposition, the size of the attack is uncertain, as the number of committed partisans - those who always attack regardless of their signal - is not observed in advance. We show that a regime on the brink of collapse optimally refrains from propaganda, while the opposition engages in counter-propaganda. The equilibrium level of counter-propaganda increases with the opposition's benefit-cost ratio and with the precision of citizens' private signals, and decreases with the cost of attacking.</description>

      <title>The Welfare Effects of Policy Signalling in a Regime Change Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a specific parametric example of a regime change game in which a policymaker defends the status quo against a continuum of atomistic agents who seek to overthrow it. At the start of the game, the policymaker can initiate a policy intervention to make an attack less appealing. When agents' private information is relatively imprecise, signalling is beneficial to the policymaker when the fundamentals are strong but detrimental when the fundamentals are weak.</description>

      <title>Robust Voting Rules on the Interval Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study voting rules on the interval domain, where the alternatives are arranged according to an externally given strict total order and voters report intervals of this order to indicate the alternatives they support. For this setting, we introduce and characterize the class of position-threshold rules, which compute a collective position of the voters with respect to every alternative and choose the left-most alternative whose collective position exceeds its threshold value. Our characterization of these rules mainly relies on reinforcement, a well-known population consistency condition, and robustness, a new axiom that restricts how the outcome is allowed to change when a voter removes the left-most or right-most alternative from his interval. Moreover, we characterize a generalization of the median rule to the interval domain, which selects the median of the endpoints of the voters' intervals.</description>

      <title>Randomization and ambiguity perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a model of preferences over lotteries of acts in which a decision maker behaves as if optimally filtering her ambiguity perception. She has a set of plausible ambiguity perceptions and a cost function over them, and chooses multiple priors to maximize the minimum expected utility minus the cost. We characterize the model by axioms on attitude toward randomization and its timing, uniquely identify the filtering cost from observable data, and conduct several comparatives. Our model can explain Machina's (2009) two paradoxes, which are incompatible with many standard ambiguity models.</description>

      <title>False Cascades and the Cost of Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential social learning when agents can sometimes pay to verify a claim and obtain hard, publicly checkable evidence. Each agent observes the public history, receives a private signal, may investigate at a cost (succeeding only when the claim is true), and can disclose or conceal any proof. Actions are binary or continuous, with a conformity pull toward the prevailing consensus. We characterize when false cascades persist and when societies self-correct. In the binary benchmark, we derive an investigation cutoff and show how its location relative to classic cascade bands governs breakability; a simple knife-edge condition guarantees that any wrong cascade at the boundary is overturned with positive probability. With continuous actions, coarse observation and conformity can recreate cascades, yet occasional disclosures collapse them. These forces yield a tractable "resilience frontier" with transparent comparative statics and policy levers.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Quality in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic reputation model with a fixed posted price where only purchases are public. A long-lived seller chooses costly quality; each buyer observes the purchase history and a private signal. Under a Markov selection, beliefs split into two cascades - where actions are unresponsive and investment is zero - and an interior region where the seller invests. The policy is inverse-U in reputation and produces two patterns: Early Resolution (rapid absorption at the optimistic cascade) and Double Hump (two investment episodes). Higher signal precision at fixed prices enlarges cascades and can reduce investment. We compare welfare and analyze two design levers: flexible pricing, which can keep actions informative and remove cascades for patient sellers, and public outcome disclosure, which makes purchases more informative and expands investment.</description>

      <title>Advising with Threshold Tests: Complexity, Signaling, and Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A benevolent advisor observes a project's complexity and posts a pass - fail threshold before the agent chooses effort. The project succeeds only if ability and effort together clear complexity. We compare two informational regimes. In the naive regime, the threshold is treated as non-informative; in the sophisticated regime, the threshold is a signal and the agent updates beliefs. We characterize equilibrium threshold policies and show that the optimal threshold rises with complexity under mild regularity. We then give primitives-based sufficient conditions that guarantee separating, pooling, or semi-separating outcomes. In a benchmark with uniform ability, exponential complexity, and power costs, we provide explicit parameter regions that partition the space by equilibrium type; a standard refinement eliminates most pooling. The results yield transparent comparative statics and welfare comparisons across regimes.</description>

      <title>Contrarian Motives in Social Learning: Information Cascades with Nonconformist Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embed a taste for nonconformism into a canonical Bikhchandani-Hirshleifer-Welch social-learning model. Agents value both correctness and choosing the minority action (fixed or proportion-based bonus). We study exogenous signals and endogenous acquisition with a fixed entry cost and convex cost of precision in a Gaussian-quadratic specification. Contrarian motives shift equilibrium cutoffs away from 1/2 and expand the belief region where information is purchased, sustaining informative actions; conditional on investing, chosen precision is lower near central beliefs. Welfare is shaped by a trade-off: mild contrarianism counteracts premature herding, whereas strong contrarianism steers actions against informative social signals and induces low-value experimentation. A tractable characterization delivers closed-form cutoffs, comparative statics, and transparent welfare comparisons. Applications include scientific priority races and academic diffusion, where distinctiveness yields rents yet excessive contrarianism erodes information aggregation.</description>

      <title>Herding Prices: Social Learning and Dynamic Competition in Duopoly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embed observational learning (BHW) in a symmetric duopoly with random arrivals and search frictions. With fixed posted prices, a mixed-strategy pricing equilibrium exists and yields price dispersion even with ex-ante identical firms. We provide closed-form cascade bands and show wrong cascades occur with positive probability for interior parameters, vanishing as signals become precise or search costs fall; absorption probabilities are invariant to the arrival rate. In equilibrium, the support of mixed prices is connected and overlapping; its width shrinks with signal precision and expands with search costs, and mean prices comove accordingly. Under Calvo price resets (Poisson opportunities), stationary dispersion and mean prices fall; when signals are sufficiently informative, wrong-cascade risk also declines. On welfare, a state-contingent Pigouvian search subsidy implements the planner's cutoff. Prominence (biased first visits) softens competition and depresses welfare; neutral prominence is ex-ante optimal.</description>

      <title>Social Learning from Experts with Uncertain Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study social learning from multiple experts whose precision is unknown and who care about reputation. The observer both learns a persistent state and ranks experts. In a binary baseline we characterize per-period equilibria: high types are truthful; low types distort one-sidedly with closed-form mixing around the prior. Aggregation is additive in log-likelihood ratios. Light-touch design -- evaluation windows scored by strictly proper rules or small convex deviation costs -- restores strict informativeness and delivers asymptotic efficiency under design (consistent state learning and reputation identification). A Gaussian extension yields a mimicry coefficient and linear filtering. With common shocks, GLS weights are optimal and correlation slows learning. The framework fits advisory panels, policy committees, and forecasting platforms, and yields transparent comparative statics and testable implications.</description>

      <title>Self-Employment as a Signal: Career Concerns with Hidden Firm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a dynamic labor market in which a worker with career concerns chooses each period between (i) self-employment that makes output publicly observable and (ii) employment at a firm that pays a flat wage but keeps individual performance hidden from outside observers. Output is binary and the worker is risk averse. The worker values future opportunities through a reputation for talent; firms may be benchmark (myopic) (ignoring the informational content of an application) or equilibrium (updating beliefs from the very act of applying). Three forces shape equilibrium: an insurance - information trade-off, selection by reputation, and inference from application decisions. We show that (i) an absorbing employment region exists in which low-reputation workers strictly prefer the firm's insurance and optimally cease producing public information; (ii) sufficiently strong reputation triggers self-employment in order to generate public signals and preserve future outside options; and (iii) with equilibrium firms, application choices act as signals that shift hiring thresholds and wages even when in-firm performance remains opaque. Comparative statics deliver sharp, testable predictions for the prevalence of self-employment, the cyclicality of switching, and wage dynamics across markets with different degrees of performance transparency. The framework links classic career-concerns models to contemporary environments in which some tasks generate portable, public histories while firm tasks remain unobserved by the outside market (e.g., open-source contributions, freelancing platforms, or sales roles with standardized public metrics). Our results rationalize recent empirical findings on the value of public performance records and illuminate when opacity inside firms dampens or amplifies reputational incentives.</description>

      <title>MAD Chairs: A new tool to evaluate AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20986v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes a new way to evaluate AI. Much as one might evaluate a machine in terms of its performance at chess, this approach involves evaluating a machine in terms of its performance at a game called "MAD Chairs". At the time of writing, evaluation with this game exposed opportunities to improve Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Qwen and DeepSeek. Furthermore, this paper sets a stage for future innovation in game theory and AI safety by providing an example of success with non-standard approaches to each: studying a game beyond the scope of previous game theoretic tools and mitigating a serious AI safety risk in a way that requires neither determination of values nor their enforcement.</description>
