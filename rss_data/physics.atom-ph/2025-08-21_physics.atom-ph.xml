      <title>Precision calculation of hyperfine-structure constants for extracting nuclear quadrupole moment of $^{43}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several reported values for the nuclear quadrupole moment of $^{43}$Ca, but significant discrepancies exist among these reported values, ranging from \(-0.0408(8)\)~b to \(-0.065(20)\)~b. In this work, we performed an accurate calculation of the electric field gradients of the \(4s4p~^3\!P_{1}\), \(4s4p~^3\!P_{2}\) and \(4s3d~^1\!D_2\) states in the $^{43}$Ca atom using a hybrid method. This hybrid method integrates the advantages of the configuration interaction method and the coupled-cluster method, and can simultaneously account for core-core, core-valence, and valence-valence correlations. By combining our calculated results with the experimental values of the electric quadrupole hyperfine-structure constants of these three states, an accurate and reliable nuclear quadrupole moment of $^{43}$Ca was determined to be \(-0.0479(6)\)~b, which could be recommended as a reference for \(^{43}\text{Ca}\).</description>

      <title>Land\'e $g$ factor measurement of $^{48}$Ti$^+$ using simultaneous co-magnetometry and quantum logic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of atomic systems as accurate magnetic field probes requires precise characterization of the particle's magnetic properties. Insufficient knowledge of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the external magnetic field often limits the determination of the corresponding atomic parameters. Here, we present a quantum logic scheme mitigating systematic effects caused by temporal magnetic field fluctuations through simultaneous co-magnetometry. This allows measurement of the ground state $g$ factors of a single $^{48}$Ti$^+$ ion with uncertainties at the $10^{-6}$ level. We compare experimentally determined $g$ factors with new theoretical predictions using a combination of configuration interaction (CI) and second-order many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Theory and experiment agree within the expected level of accuracy. The scheme can be applied to many atomic species, including those that cannot be directly laser cooled.</description>

      <title>Impact of ligand (OH) deformation on LuOH$^+$ rovibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triatomic cation $^{175}$LuOH$^+$, featuring near-degenerate, opposite-parity $l$-doublets, offers enhanced sensitivity to $\mathcal{P}$- and $\mathcal{T}$-violating interactions. We present \emph{ab initio} calculations of its electronic structure and rovibrational structure beyond the rigid-ligand approximation by explicitly including OH-ligand deformation together with bending and stretching motions. Potential-energy surfaces are computed at the relativistic coupled cluster level of theory. The nuclear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in Jacobi coordinates is solved by means of a coupled-channel expansion. Ligand deformation reduces the bending frequency by a few percent and increases the $l$-doubling constant $q$, while the stretching frequencies and rotational constants remain largely unchanged. For the first excited bending level, we predict $\Delta E_{J=1}=2q \approx 24.9$--$26.4$ MHz. These results establish LuOH$^+$ as a viable platform for precision searches for $\mathcal{CP}$-violating physics via the electron electric dipole moment and the nuclear magnetic quadrupole moment.</description>

      <title>Multipole expansion for dispersion forces -- watch this trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction models invariably rely on the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic potentials generated by complex charge distributions. These multipoles are typically taken to be traceless, however, for a correct evaluation of dispersion forces at all distances, the validity of this assumption has to be checked carefully. Here, we revisit the concept of dispersion forces on an atom near a dielectric surface from the perspective of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and find that, beyond the quadrupole, the multipoles cannot always be taken as fully traceless. In particular, we show that the trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of Nitrogen-Vacancy spin in Diamonds: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we present our work on quantum control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin system in bulk diamonds and in levitated diamonds as a step towards Stern-Gerlach interferometry with levitated nanodiamonds. Our simulations show that the current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>Neutralization of Levitated Charged Nanodiamond: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community.
  In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art. As neutralization is crucial to avoid spatial decoherence, this constitutes a significant step towards the realization of a nanodiamond spatial interferometer. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>One-Electron Quantum Cyclotron as a Milli-eV Dark-Photon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using trapped electrons as high-$Q$ resonators for detecting meV dark photon dark matter. When the rest energy of the dark photon matches the energy splitting of the two lowest cyclotron levels, the first excited state of the electron cyclotron will be resonantly excited. A proof-of-principle measurement, carried out with one electron, demonstrates that the method is background-free over a 7.4 day search. It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints. Dark photon dark matter in the 0.1-1 meV mass range (20-200 GHz) could likely be detected at a similar sensitivity in an apparatus designed for dark photon detection.</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient preparation of entangled states in cavity QED with Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18881v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <title>Deterministic carving of quantum states with Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>
