      <title>Betti Numbers for Modules Over Artinian Local Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new numerical invariant $\gamma_I(M)$ associated to a finite-length $R$-module $M$ and an ideal $I$ in an Artinian local ring $R$. This invariant measures the ratio between $\lambda(IM)$ and $\lambda(M/IM)$. We establish fundamental relationships between this invariant and the Betti numbers of the module under the assumption of the $\operatorname{Tor}$ modules vanishing. In particular, we use this invariant to establish a freeness criterion for modules under certain $\operatorname{Tor}$ vanishing conditions. The criterion applies specifically to the class of $I$-free modules -- those modules $M$ for which $M/IM$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of copies of $R/I$. Lastly, we apply these results to the canonical module, proving that, under certain conditions on the ring structure, when the zeroth Betti number is greater than or equal to the first Betti number of the canonical module, then the ring is Gorenstein. This partially answers a question posed by Jorgensen and Leuschke concerning the relationship between Betti numbers of the canonical module and Gorenstein properties.</description>

      <title>Recursive Koszul flattenings of determinant and permanent tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate new lower bounds on the tensor rank of the determinant and the permanent tensors via recursive usage of the Koszul flattening method introduced by Landsberg-Ottaviani and Hauenstein-Oeding-Ottaviani-Sommese. Our lower bounds on $\mathbf{R} (\det_n)$ completely separate the determinant and the permanent tensors by their tensor ranks. Furthermore, we determine the exact tensor ranks $\mathbf{R} (\det_4) = 12$ and $\mathbf{R} (\operatorname{perm}_4) = 8$ over arbitrary field of characteristic $\neq 2$.</description>

      <title>Regularity of $3$-Path Ideals of Trees and Unicyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph and $I_3(G)$ be its $3$-path ideal in the corresponding polynomial ring $R$. In this article, we prove that for an arbitrary graph $G$, $reg(R/I_3(G))$ is bounded below by $2\nu_3(G)$, where $\nu_3(G)$ denotes the $3$-path induced matching number of $G$. We give a class of graphs, namely, trees for which the lower bound is attained. Also, for a unicyclic graph $G$, we show that $reg(R/I_3(G))\leq 2\nu_3(G)+2$ and provide an example that shows that the given upper bound is sharp.</description>

      <title>On binomial edge ideals of corona of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, let $J_G$ denote the corresponding binomial edge ideal. This article considers the binomial edge ideal of the corona product of two connected graphs $G$ and $H$. The corona product of $G$ and $H$, denoted by $G\circ H$, is a construction where each vertex of $G$ is connected (via the coning-off) to an entire copy of $H$. This is a direct generalization of a cone construction. Previous studies have shown that for $J_{G \circ H}$ to be Cohen-Macaulay, both $G$ and $H$ must be complete graphs. However, there are no general formulae for the dimension, depth, or Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $J_{G\circ H}$ for all graphs $G$ and $H$. In this article, we provide a general formula for the dimension, depth and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the binomial edge ideals of certain corona and corona-type (somewhat a generalization of corona) products of special interests. Additionally, we study the Cohen-Macaulayness, unmixedness and related properties of binomial edge ideals corresponding to above class of graphs. We have also added a short note on the reduction of the Bolognini-Macchia-Strazzanti Conjecture to all graphs with a diameter of $3$.</description>

      <title>On numerical semigroup elements and the $\ell_0$- and $\ell_\infty$-norms of their factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical semigroup $S$ is a cofinite, additively-closed subset of $\mathbb Z_{\ge 0}$ that contains 0, and a factorization of $x \in S$ is a $k$-tuple $z = (z_1, \ldots, z_k)$ where $x = z_1a_1 + \cdots + z_ka_k$ expresses $x$ as a sum of generators of $S = \langle a_1, \ldots, a_k \rangle$. Much~of the study of non-unique factorization centers on factorization length $z_1 + \cdots + z_k$, which coincies with the $\ell_1$-norm of $z$ as the $k$-tuple. In this paper, we study the $\ell_\infty$-norm and $\ell_0$-norm of factorizations, viewed as alternative notions of length, with particular focus on the generalizations $\Delta_\infty(x)$ and $\Delta_0(x)$ of the delta set $\Delta(x)$ from classical factorization length. We prove that the $\infty$-delta set $\Delta_\infty(x)$ is eventually periodic as a function of $x \in S$, classify $\Delta_\infty(S)$ and the 0-delta set $\Delta_0(S)$ for several well-studied families of numerical semigroups, and identify families of numerical semigroups demonstrating $\Delta_\infty(S)$ and $\Delta_0(S)$ can be arbitrarily long intervals and can avoid arbitrarily long subintervals.</description>

Abstract: We characterize a binomial such that the Artinian algebra whose Macaulay dual generator is the binomial is a complete intersection. As an application, we prove that the Artinian algebra with a binomial Macaulay dual generator has the strong Lefschetz property in characteristic 0 if the Artinian algebra is a complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Equality of DSER elementary orthogonal group and Eichler-Siegel-Dickson transvection group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Dickson-Siegel-Eichler-Roy (DSER) elementary orthogonal group, which was introduced by Amit Roy in 1968 and the Eichler-Siegel-Dickson transvection group, which is in literature in the works of Dickson, Siegel and Eichler, are equal over a commutative ring in which $2$ is invertible. We prove the equality in the free case by considering the odd and even case separately and then generalize this result by using the local-global principle. This result generalizes previous results concerning the equality of elementary orthogonal transvection groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study several notions in the setting of higher ramification theory, in particular ramification ideals and differents. After general results on the computation of ramification ideals, we discuss their connection with defect and compute them for Artin-Schreier extensions and Kummer extensions of prime degree equal to the residue degree, with or without defect. We present an example that shows that nontrivial defect in an extension of degree not a pime may not imply the existence of a nonprincipal ramification ideal. We compute differents for the mentioned extensions of prime degree, after computing the necessary traces, and discuss the question when they are equal to the annihilator of the K\"ahler differentials of the extension. Further, we introduce and study the ideal generated by the differents of the elements of the upper valuation rings in such extensions.</description>

      <title>The Scarf complex of squarefree powers, symbolic powers of edge ideals, and cover ideals of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every monomial ideal $I$ has a Scarf complex, which is a subcomplex of its minimal free resolution. We say that $I$ is Scarf if its Scarf complex is also its minimal free resolution. In this paper, we fully characterize all pairs $(G,n)$ of a graph $G$ and an integer $n$ such that the squarefree power $I(G)^{[n]}$ or the symbolic power $I(G)^{(n)}$ of the edge ideal $I(G)$ is Scarf. We also determine all graphs $G$ such that its cover ideal $J(G)$ is Scarf, with an explicit description when $G$ is either chordal or bipartite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two algebras of curves associated to an oriented surface of finite type - the cluster algebra from combinatorial algebra, and the skein algebra from quantum topology. We focus on generalizations of cluster algebras and generalizations of skein algebras that include arcs whose endpoints are marked points on the boundary or in the interior of the surface. We show that the generalizations are closely related by maps that can be explicitly defined, and we explore the structural implications, including (non-)finite generation. We also discuss open questions about the algebraic structure of the algebras.</description>

      <title>On the computation of K\"ahler differentials and characterizations of Galois extensions with independent defect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For important cases of algebraic extensions of valued fields, we develop presentations of the associated K\"ahler differentials of the extensions of their valuation rings. We compute their annihilators as well as the associated Dedekind differentials. We then apply the results to Galois defect extensions of prime degree. Defects can appear in finite extensions of valued fields of positive residue characteristic and are serious obstructions to several problems in positive characteristic. A classification of defects (dependent vs.\ independent) has been introduced by the second and the third author. It has been shown that perfectoid fields and deeply ramified fields only admit extensions with independent defect. We give several characterizations of independent defect, using ramification ideals, K\"ahler differentials and traces of the maximal ideals of valuation rings. All of our results are for arbitrary valuations; in particular, we have no restrictions on their rank or value groups.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler differentials of extensions of valuation rings and deeply ramified fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04967v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume that $(L,v)$ is a finite Galois extension of a valued field $(K,v)$. We give an explicit construction of the valuation ring $\mathcal O_L$ of $L$ as an $\mathcal O_K$-algebra, and an explicit description of the module of relative K\"ahler differentials $\Omega_{\mathcal O_L|\mathcal O_K}$ when $L|K$ is a Kummer extension of prime degree or an Artin-Schreier extension, in terms of invariants of the valuation and field extension. The case when this extension has nontrivial defect was solved in a recent paper by the authors with Anna Rzepka. The present paper deals with the complementary (defectless) case. The results are known classically for (rank 1) discrete valuations, but our systematic approach to non-discrete valuations (even of rank 1) is new. We also show that the annihilator of $\Omega_{\mathcal O_L|\mathcal O_K}$ can only be equal to the maximal ideal $\mathcal M_L$ of $\mathcal O_L$ if the extension is defectless and $\mathcal M_L$ is principal.
  Using our results from the prime degree case, we characterize when $\Omega_{\mathcal O_L|\mathcal O_K}=0$ holds for an arbitrary finite Galois extension of valued fields. As an application of these results, we give a simple proof of a theorem of Gabber and Ramero, which characterizes when a valued field is deeply ramified. We further give a simple characterization of deeply ramified fields with residue fields of characteristic $p&gt;0$ in terms of the K\"ahler differentials of Galois extensions of degree $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The separating Noether number $\beta_{\mathrm{sep}}(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the minimal positive integer $d$ such that for every finite $G$-module $V$ there is a separating set consisting of invariant polynomials of degree at most $d$. In this paper we use methods from additive combinatorics to investigate the separating Noether number for finite abelian groups. Among others, we obtain the exact value of $\beta_{\mathrm{sep}}(G)$, provided that $G$ is either a $p$-group or has rank $2$, $3$ or $5$.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal successive minima, partial jets and convex geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two sets of invariants for a line bundle at a point: infinitesimal successive minima and asymptotic partial jet separation. They are inspired by the local analogue of Ambro-Ito, and by the jet-theoretic interpretation of the Seshadri constant respectively. Under mild restrictions the two sets are equal. Moving to convex geometry, we prove that the lengths of the maximal simplex inside the generic infinitesimal Newton-Okounkov body (iNObody) of the line bundle at the point are precisely the successive minima. As application we characterize when this body is simplicial, and give examples when it is not. When the point is very general the convex body has a shape that we call Borel-fixed, a property inspired by generic initial ideals. Borel-fixed convex bodies satisfy simplicial lower bounds and polytopal upper bounds determined by their widths. For the generic iNObody of the line bundle at very general points these widths are again the infinitesimal successive minima.</description>
