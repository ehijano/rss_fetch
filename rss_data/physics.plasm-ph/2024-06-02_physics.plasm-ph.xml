      <title>From Density Response to Energy Functionals and Back: An ab initio perspective on Matter Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy functionals serve as the basis for different models and methods in quantum and classical many-particle physics. Arguably, one of the most successful and widely used approaches in material science at both ambient and extreme conditions is density functional theory (DFT). Various flavors of DFT methods are being actively used to study material properties at extreme conditions, such as in warm dense matter, dense plasmas, and nuclear physics applications. In this review, we focus on the warm dense matter regime, which occurs in the core of giant planets and stellar atmospheres, and as a transient state in inertial confinement fusion experiments. We discuss the connection between linear density response functions and free energy functionals as well as the utility of the linear response formalism for the construction of advanced functionals. As a new result, we derive the stiffness theorem linking the change in the intrinsic free energy to the density response properties of electrons. We review and summarize recent works that assess various exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for an inhomogeneous electron gas that is perturbed by a harmonic external field and for warm dense hydrogen using exact path integral quantum Monte Carlo data as an unassailable benchmark. This constitutes a valuable guide for selecting an appropriate XC functional for DFT calculations in the context of investigating the inhomogeneous electronic structure of warm dense matter. We stress that correctly simulating the strongly perturbed electron gas necessitates the correct UEG limit of the XC and non-interacting free-energy functionals.</description>

      <title>Direct Laser Acceleration of Bethe-Heitler positrons in laser-channel interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron creation and acceleration is one of the major challenges for constructing future lepton colliders. On the one hand, conventional technology can provide a solution, but at a prohibitive cost and scale. On the other hand, alternative, reduced-scale ideas for positron beam generation could bring this dream closer to reality. Here we propose a novel plasma-based positron acceleration method using a powerful laser propagating through a dense and narrow plasma channel. A large amount of electrons is injected within the channel during laser propagation. This electron loading creates static fields in the plasma, enabling positrons to be guided transversely while they directly gain energy from the laser field itself. Within this context, we present a theoretical model to describe how the laser injects the electrons and estimate the beam-loaded effective electron density. We validate our theoretical predictions through Quasi-3D PIC simulations and demonstrate the robustness of this guiding and direct laser acceleration process for positrons. Our approach could pave the way for testing this new positron acceleration scheme at ELI-Beamlines, showcasing unprecedentedly high average energy gain rate of a few TeV/m. The fireball jet produced contains GeV-level electrons, positrons, and x-rays, opening the path towards potential laboratory astrophysics experiments using these beams.</description>

      <title>Poynting flux transport channels formed in polar cap regions of neutron star magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair cascades in polar cap regions of neutron stars are considered to be an essential process in various models of coherent radio emissions of pulsars. The cascades produce pair plasma bunch discharges in quasi-periodic spark events. The cascade properties, and therefore also the coherent radiation, depend strongly on the magnetospheric plasma properties and vary significantly across and along the polar cap. It is furthermore still uncertain from where the radio emission emanates in polar cap region.
  We investigate the generation of electromagnetic waves by pair cascades and their propagation in the polar cap for three representative inclination angles of a magnetic dipole, $0^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $90^\circ$.
  2D particle-in-cell simulations that include quantum-electrodynamic pair cascades are used in a charge limited flow from the star surface.
  We found that the discharge properties are strongly dependent on the magnetospheric current profile in the polar cap and that transport channels for high intensity Poynting flux are formed along magnetic field lines where the magnetospheric currents approach zero and where the plasma cannot carry the magnetospheric currents. There, the parallel Poynting flux component is efficiently transported away from the star and may eventually escape the magnetosphere as coherent radio waves. The Poynting flux decreases faster with the distance from the star in regions of high magnetospheric currents.
  Our model shows that no process of energy conversion from particles to waves is necessary for the coherent radio wave emission. Moreover, the pulsar radio beam does not have a cone structure, but rather the radiation generated by the oscillating electric gap fields directly escapes along open magnetic field lines in which no pair creation occurs.</description>
