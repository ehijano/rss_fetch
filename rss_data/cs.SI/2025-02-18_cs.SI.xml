      <title>Unpacking the Layers: Exploring Self-Disclosure Norms, Engagement Dynamics, and Privacy Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the self-disclosure behavior of Reddit users across 11 different types of self-disclosure. We find that at least half of the users share some type of disclosure in at least 10% of their posts, with half of these posts having more than one type of disclosure. We show that different types of self-disclosure are likely to receive varying levels of engagement. For instance, a Sexual Orientation disclosure garners more comments than other self-disclosures. We also explore confounding factors that affect future self-disclosure. We show that users who receive interactions from (self-disclosure) specific subreddit members are more likely to disclose in the future. We also show that privacy risks due to self-disclosure extend beyond Reddit users themselves to include their close contacts, such as family and friends, as their information is also revealed. We develop a browser plugin for end-users to flag self-disclosure in their content.</description>

      <title>Human-Centric Community Detection in Hybrid Metaverse Networks with Integrated AI Entities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is a cornerstone problem in social network analysis (SNA), aimed at identifying cohesive communities with minimal external links. However, the rise of generative AI and Metaverse introduce complexities by creating hybrid human-AI social networks (denoted by HASNs), where traditional methods fall short, especially in human-centric settings. This paper introduces a novel community detection problem in HASNs (denoted by MetaCD), which seeks to enhance human connectivity within communities while reducing the presence of AI nodes. Effective processing of MetaCD poses challenges due to the delicate trade-off between excluding certain AI nodes and maintaining community structure. To address this, we propose CUSA, an innovative framework incorporating AI-aware clustering techniques that navigate this trade-off by selectively retaining AI nodes that contribute to community integrity. Furthermore, given the scarcity of real-world HASNs, we devise four strategies for synthesizing these networks under various hypothetical scenarios. Empirical evaluations on real social networks, reconfigured as HASNs, demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach compared to traditional non-deep learning and graph neural network (GNN)-based methods.</description>

      <title>Open-Set Cross-Network Node Classification via Unknown-Excluded Adversarial Graph Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing cross-network node classification methods are mainly proposed for closed-set setting, where the source network and the target network share exactly the same label space. Such a setting is restricted in real-world applications, since the target network might contain additional classes that are not present in the source. In this work, we study a more realistic open-set cross-network node classification (O-CNNC) problem, where the target network contains all the known classes in the source and further contains several target-private classes unseen in the source. Borrowing the concept from open-set domain adaptation, all target-private classes are defined as an additional unknown class. To address the challenging O-CNNC problem, we propose an unknown-excluded adversarial graph domain alignment (UAGA) model with a separate-adapt training strategy. Firstly, UAGA roughly separates known classes from unknown class, by training a graph neural network encoder and a neighborhood-aggregation node classifier in an adversarial framework. Then, unknown-excluded adversarial domain alignment is customized to align only target nodes from known classes with the source, while pushing target nodes from unknown class far away from the source, by assigning positive and negative domain adaptation coefficient to known class nodes and unknown class nodes. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant outperformance of the proposed UAGA over state-of-the-art methods on O-CNNC.</description>

      <title>Explosive Growth in Large-Scale Collaboration Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the evolution of two large collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020), comprising $2.72 \times 10^8$ and $1.88 \times 10^6$ nodes respectively. The networks show super-linear growth, with node counts following power laws $N(t) \propto t^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha = 2.3$ increasing to $3.1$ after 1950 (MAG) and $\alpha = 1.8$ (IMDb). Node and edge processes maintain stable but noisy timescale ratios ($\tau_N/\tau_E \approx 2.8 \pm 0.3$ MAG, $2.3 \pm 0.2$ IMDb). The probability of waiting a time $t$ between successive collaborations was found to be scale-free, $P(t) \propto t^{-\gamma}$, with indices evolving from $\gamma \approx 2.3$ to $1.6$ (MAG) and $2.6$ to $2.1$ (IMDb). Academic collaboration sizes increased from $1.2$ to $5.8$ authors per paper, while entertainment collaborations remained more stable ($3.2$ to $4.5$ actors). These observations indicate that current network models might be enhanced by considering accelerating growth, coupled timescales, and environmental influence, while explaining stable local properties.</description>

      <title>Parametric Analysis of Network Evolution Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive parametric analysis of node and edge lifetimes processes in two large-scale collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020). Node and edge lifetimes (career and collaboration durations) follow Weibull distributions with consistent shape parameters ($k \approx 0.2$ for academic, $k \approx 0.5$ for entertainment careers) across centuries of evolution. These distributions persist despite dramatic changes in network size and structure. Edge processes show domain-specific evolution: academic collaboration durations increase over time (power-law index $1.6$ to $2.3$) while entertainment collaborations maintain more stable patterns (index $2.6$ to $2.1$). These findings indicate that while career longevity exhibits consistent patterns, collaboration dynamics appear to be influenced by domain-specific factors. The results provide new constraints for models of social network evolution, requiring incorporation of both universal lifetime distributions and domain-specific growth dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prevalence, Sharing Patterns, and Spreaders of Multimodal AI-Generated Content on X during the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While concerns about the risks of AI-generated content (AIGC) to the integrity of social media discussions have been raised, little is known about its scale and the actors responsible for its dissemination online. In this work, we identify and characterize the prevalence, sharing patterns, and spreaders of AIGC in different modalities, including images and texts. Analyzing a large-scale dataset from X related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we find that approximately 12% of images and 1.4% of texts are deemed AI-generated. Notably, roughly 3% of text spreaders and 10% of image spreaders account for 80% of the AI-generated content within their respective modalities. Superspreaders of AIGC are more likely to be X Premium subscribers with a right-leaning orientation and exhibit automated behavior. Additionally, AI image spreaders have a higher proportion of AI-generated content in their profiles compared to AI text spreaders. This study serves as a very first step toward understanding the role generative AI plays in shaping online socio-political environments and offers implications for platform governance.</description>

      <title>Weibull Processes in Network Degree Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines degree distributions in two large collaboration networks: the Microsoft Academic Graph (1800-2020) and Internet Movie Database (1900-2020), comprising $2.72 \times 10^8$ and $1.88 \times 10^6$ nodes respectively. Statistical comparison using $\chi^2$ measures showed that Weibull distributions fit the degree distributions better than power-law or log-normal models, especially at later stages in the network evolution. The Weibull shape parameters exhibit notable stability ($k \approx 0.8$-$1.0$ for academic, $k \approx 0.9$-$1.1$ for entertainment collaborations) despite orders of magnitude growth in network size. While early-stage networks display approximate power-law scaling, mature networks develop characteristic flattening in the low-degree region that Weibull distributions appear to capture better. In the academic network, the cutoff between the flattened region and power-law tail shows a gradual increase from $5$ to $9$ edges over time, while the entertainment network maintains a distinctive degree structure that may reflect storytelling and cast-size constraints. These patterns suggest the possibility that collaboration network evolution might be influenced more by constraint-based growth than by pure preferential attachment or multiplicative processes.</description>

      <title>Maintenance of Structural Hole Spanners in Dynamic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Hole (SH) spanners are the set of users who bridge different groups of users and are vital in numerous applications. Despite their importance, existing work for identifying SH spanners focuses only on static networks. However, real-world networks are highly dynamic where the underlying structure of the network evolves continuously. Consequently, we study SH spanner problem for dynamic networks. We propose an efficient solution for updating SH spanners in dynamic networks. Our solution reuses the information obtained during the initial runs of the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected by the updates. Experimental results show that the proposed solution achieves a minimum speedup of 3.24 over recomputation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the problem of maintaining SH spanners in dynamic networks.</description>

      <title>UniGO: A Unified Graph Neural Network for Modeling Opinion Dynamics on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization and fragmentation in social media amplify user biases, making it increasingly important to understand the evolution of opinions. Opinion dynamics provide interpretability for studying opinion evolution, yet incorporating these insights into predictive models remains challenging. This challenge arises due to the inherent complexity of the diversity of opinion fusion rules and the difficulty in capturing equilibrium states while avoiding over-smoothing. This paper constructs a unified opinion dynamics model to integrate different opinion fusion rules and generates corresponding synthetic datasets. To fully leverage the advantages of unified opinion dynamics, we introduces UniGO, a framework for modeling opinion evolution on graphs. Using a coarsen-refine mechanism, UniGO efficiently models opinion dynamics through a graph neural network, mitigating over-smoothing while preserving equilibrium phenomena. UniGO leverages pretraining on synthetic datasets, which enhances its ability to generalize to real-world scenarios, providing a viable paradigm for applications of opinion dynamics. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate UniGO's effectiveness in capturing complex opinion formation processes and predicting future evolution. The pretrained model also shows strong generalization capability, validating the benefits of using synthetic data to boost real-world performance.</description>

Abstract: An important part of online activities are intended to control the public opinion and behavior, being considered currently a global threat. This article identifies and conceptualizes seven online strategies employed in social media influence operations. These procedures are quantified through the analysis of 80 incidents of foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI), estimating their real-world usage and combination. Finally, we suggest future directions for research on influence operations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Sentiment: Examining the Role of Moral Foundations in User Engagement with News on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses sentiment analysis and the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to characterise news content in social media and examine its association with user engagement. We employ Natural Language Processing to quantify the moral and affective linguistic markers. At the same time, we automatically define thematic macro areas of news from major U.S. news outlets and their Twitter followers (Jan 2020 - Mar 2021). By applying Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation to the obtained linguistic features we extract clusters of similar moral and affective profiles, and we identify the emotional and moral characteristics that mostly explain user engagement via regression modelling. We observe that Surprise, Trust, and Harm are crucial elements explaining user engagement and discussion length and that Twitter content from news media outlets has more explanatory power than their linked articles. We contribute with actionable findings evidencing the potential impact of employing specific moral and affective nuances in public and journalistic discourse in today's communication landscape. In particular, our results emphasise the need to balance engagement strategies with potential priming risks in our evolving media landscape.</description>

Abstract: Social media empower distributed content creation by algorithmically harnessing "the social fabric" (explicit and implicit signals of association) to serve this content. While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue. This paper participates in open and ongoing considerations to translate social and political values and conventions, specifically social cohesion, into platform design. We propose an alternative platform model that the social fabric an explicit output as well as input. Citizens are members of communities defined by explicit affiliation or clusters of shared attitudes. Both have internal divisions, as citizens are members of intersecting communities, which are themselves internally diverse. Each is understood to value content that bridge (viz. achieve consensus across) and balance (viz. represent fairly) this internal diversity, consistent with the principles of the Hutchins Commission (1947). Content is labeled with social provenance, indicating for which community or citizen it is bridging or balancing. Subscription payments allow citizens and communities to increase the algorithmic weight on the content they value in the content serving algorithm. Advertisers may, with consent of citizen or community counterparties, target them in exchange for payment or increase in that party's algorithmic weight. Underserved and emerging communities and citizens are optimally subsidized/supported to develop into paying participants. Content creators and communities that curate content are rewarded for their contributions with algorithmic weight and/or revenue. We discuss applications to productivity (e.g. LinkedIn), political (e.g. X), and cultural (e.g. TikTok) platforms.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hate Speech Online: An Adaptive Framework for Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media platforms has led to an increase in the spread of hate speech, particularly targeting vulnerable communities. Unfortunately, existing methods for automatically identifying and blocking toxic language rely on pre-constructed lexicons, making them reactive rather than adaptive. As such, these approaches become less effective over time, especially when new communities are targeted with slurs not included in the original datasets. To address this issue, we present an adaptive approach that uses word embeddings to update lexicons and develop a hybrid model that adjusts to emerging slurs and new linguistic patterns. This approach can effectively detect toxic language, including intentional spelling mistakes employed by aggressors to avoid detection. Our hybrid model, which combines BERT with lexicon-based techniques, achieves an accuracy of 95% for most state-of-the-art datasets. Our work has significant implications for creating safer online environments by improving the detection of toxic content and proactively updating the lexicon. Content Warning: This paper contains examples of hate speech that may be triggering.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global platforms -- centralized/autocratic (Facebook etc.) and decentralized/plutocratic (Bitcoin etc.) alike. Key grassroots platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However, grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  Here, we aim to provide a more suitable formal foundation for grassroots platforms. To do so, we enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new foundation. We present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming, joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations. We prove a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a better mathematical foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from which their implementation can commence.</description>

      <title>Competing LLM Agents in a Non-Cooperative Game of Opinion Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence.</description>

      <title>Can LLM Agents Maintain a Persona in Discourse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as conversational agents, exploiting their capabilities in various sectors such as education, law, medicine, and more. However, LLMs are often subjected to context-shifting behaviour, resulting in a lack of consistent and interpretable personality-aligned interactions. Adherence to psychological traits lacks comprehensive analysis, especially in the case of dyadic (pairwise) conversations. We examine this challenge from two viewpoints, initially using two conversation agents to generate a discourse on a certain topic with an assigned personality from the OCEAN framework (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) as High/Low for each trait. This is followed by using multiple judge agents to infer the original traits assigned to explore prediction consistency, inter-model agreement, and alignment with the assigned personality. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can be guided toward personality-driven dialogue, their ability to maintain personality traits varies significantly depending on the combination of models and discourse settings. These inconsistencies emphasise the challenges in achieving stable and interpretable personality-aligned interactions in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Discovering Structural Hole Spanners in Dynamic Networks via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural Hole (SH) theory states that the node which acts as a connecting link among otherwise disconnected communities gets positional advantages in the network. These nodes are called Structural Hole Spanners (SHS). SHSs have many applications, including viral marketing, information dissemination, community detection, etc. Numerous solutions are proposed to discover SHSs; however, most of the solutions are only applicable to static networks. Since real-world networks are dynamic networks; consequently, in this study, we aim to discover SHSs in dynamic networks. Discovering SHSs is an NP-hard problem, due to which, instead of discovering exact k SHSs, we adopt a greedy approach to discover top-k SHSs. Motivated from the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various graph mining problems, we design a Graph Neural Network-based model, GNN-SHS, to discover SHSs in dynamic networks, aiming to reduce the computational cost while achieving high accuracy. We analyze the efficiency of the proposed model through exhaustive experiments, and our results show that the proposed GNN-SHS model is at least 31.8 times faster and, on an average 671.6 times faster than the comparative method, providing a considerable efficiency advantage.</description>

      <title>Effective Graph-Neural-Network based Models for Discovering Structural Hole Spanners in Large-Scale and Diverse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Structural Hole Spanner (SHS) is a set of nodes in a network that act as a bridge among different otherwise disconnected communities. Numerous solutions have been proposed to discover SHSs that generally require high run time on large-scale networks. Another challenge is discovering SHSs across different types of networks for which the traditional one-model-fit-all approach fails to capture the inter-graph difference, particularly in the case of diverse networks. Therefore, there is an urgent need of developing effective solutions for discovering SHSs in large-scale and diverse networks. Inspired by the recent advancement of graph neural network approaches on various graph problems, we propose graph neural network-based models to discover SHS nodes in large scale networks and diverse networks. We transform the problem into a learning problem and propose an efficient model GraphSHS, that exploits both the network structure and node features to discover SHS nodes in large scale networks, endeavouring to lessen the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. To effectively discover SHSs across diverse networks, we propose another model Meta-GraphSHS based on meta-learning that learns generalizable knowledge from diverse training graphs (instead of directly learning the model) and utilizes the learned knowledge to create a customized model to identify SHSs in each new graph. We theoretically show that the depth of the proposed graph neural network model should be at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ to accurately calculate the SHSs discovery problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed models through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experimental results show that GraphSHS discovers SHSs with high accuracy and is at least 167.1 times faster than the comparative methods on large-scale real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Talking Wikidata: Communication patterns and their impact on community engagement in collaborative knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study collaboration patterns of Wikidata, one of the world's largest open source collaborative knowledge graph (KG) communities. Collaborative KG communities, play a key role in structuring machine-readable knowledge to support AI systems like conversational agents. However, these communities face challenges related to long-term member engagement, as a small subset of contributors often is responsible for the majority of contributions and decision-making. While prior research has explored contributors' roles and lifespans, discussions within collaborative KG communities remain understudied. To fill this gap, we investigated the behavioural patterns of contributors and factors affecting their communication and participation. We analysed all the discussions on Wikidata using a mixed methods approach, including statistical tests, network analysis, and text and graph embedding representations. Our findings reveal that the interactions between Wikidata editors form a small world network, resilient to dropouts and inclusive, where both the network topology and discussion content influence the continuity of conversations. Furthermore, the account age of Wikidata members and their conversations are significant factors in their long-term engagement with the project. Our observations and recommendations can benefit the Wikidata and semantic web communities, providing guidance on how to improve collaborative environments for sustainability, growth, and quality.</description>

      <title>Network regression and supervised centrality estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The centrality in a network is often used to measure nodes' importance and model network effects on a certain outcome. Empirical studies widely adopt a two-stage procedure, which first estimates the centrality from the observed noisy network and then infers the network effect from the estimated centrality, even though it lacks theoretical understanding. We propose a unified modeling framework to study the properties of centrality estimation and inference and the subsequent network regression analysis with noisy network observations. Furthermore, we propose a supervised centrality estimation methodology, which aims to simultaneously estimate both centrality and network effect. We showcase the advantages of our method compared with the two-stage method both theoretically and numerically via extensive simulations and a case study in predicting currency risk premiums from the global trade network.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have presented significant opportunities to enhance various machine learning applications, including graph neural networks (GNNs). By leveraging the vast open-world knowledge within LLMs, we can more effectively interpret and utilize textual data to better characterize heterophilic graphs, where neighboring nodes often have different labels. However, existing approaches for heterophilic graphs overlook the rich textual data associated with nodes, which could unlock deeper insights into their heterophilic contexts. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for modeling heterophilic graphs and propose a novel two-stage framework: LLM-enhanced edge discriminator and LLM-guided edge reweighting. In the first stage, we fine-tune the LLM to better identify homophilic and heterophilic edges based on the textual content of their nodes. In the second stage, we adaptively manage message propagation in GNNs for different edge types based on node features, structures, and heterophilic or homophilic characteristics. To cope with the computational demands when deploying LLMs in practical scenarios, we further explore model distillation techniques to fine-tune smaller, more efficient models that maintain competitive performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance node classification on heterophilic graphs.</description>
