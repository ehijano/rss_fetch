      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). Presently, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance in a planar electron storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. By invoking such a scheme, the laser modulator of an SSMB storage ring can work in a continuous wave or high duty cycle mode, thus allowing a high filling factor of microbunched electron beam in the storage ring and high average output radiation power. The backbone of it is the precision transverse-longitudinal phase space coupling dynamics, which is analyzed in depth in this paper. Based on the investigation, an example parameters set of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The presented work here, like the analysis on theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB, but also future accelerator light sources in general which demand more and more precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>Swedish Beams -- The Story of Particle Accelerators in Sweden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though many of the experiments leading to the standard model of particle physics were done at large accelerator laboratories in the US and at CERN[1] many exciting developments happened in smaller national facilities all over the world. In this report we highlight the history of accelerator facilities in Sweden which was home to the highest-energy cyclotron in Europe for some time in the early 1950s.

      <title>Channeling Acceleration in Crystals and Nanostructures and Studies of Solid Plasmas: New Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma wakefield acceleration (PWFA) has shown illustrious progress and resulted in an impressive demonstration of tens of GeV particle acceleration in meter-long single structures. To reach even higher energies in the 1 TeV to 10 TeV range, a promising scheme is channeling acceleration in solid-density plasmas within crystals or nanostructures.
  The E336 experiment studies the beam-nanotarget interaction with the highly compressed electron bunches available at the FACET-II accelerator. These studies furthermore involve an in-depth research on dynamics of beam-plasma instabilities in ultra-dense plasma, its development and suppression in structured media like carbon nanotubes and crystals, and its potential use to transversely modulate the electron bunch.</description>
