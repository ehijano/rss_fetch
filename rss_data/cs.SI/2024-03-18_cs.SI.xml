      <title>Distinguishing Neighborhood Representations Through Reverse Process of GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) resembles the diffusion process, leading to the over-smoothing of learned representations when stacking many layers. Hence, the reverse process of message passing can sharpen the node representations by inverting the forward message propagation. The sharpened representations can help us to better distinguish neighboring nodes with different labels, such as in heterophilic graphs. In this work, we apply the design principle of the reverse process to the three variants of the GNNs. Through the experiments on heterophilic graph data, where adjacent nodes need to have different representations for successful classification, we show that the reverse process significantly improves the prediction performance in many cases. Additional analysis reveals that the reverse mechanism can mitigate the over-smoothing over hundreds of layers.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility of Communities against Low-Credibility Content in Social News Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social news websites, such as Reddit, have evolved into prominent platforms for sharing and discussing news. A key issue on social news websites sites is the formation of echo chambers, which often lead to the spread of highly biased or uncredible news. We develop a method to identify communities within a social news website that are prone to uncredible or highly biased news. We employ a user embedding pipeline that detects user communities based on their stances towards posts and news sources. We then project each community onto a credibility-bias space and analyze the distributional characteristics of each projected community to identify those that have a high risk of adopting beliefs with low credibility or high bias. This approach also enables the prediction of individual users' susceptibility to low credibility content, based on their community affiliation. Our experiments show that latent space clusters effectively indicate the credibility and bias levels of their users, with significant differences observed across clusters -- a $34\%$ difference in the users' susceptibility to low-credibility content and a $8.3\%$ difference in the users' susceptibility to high political bias.</description>

      <title>Gender differences in online communication: A case study of Soccer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media and digital platforms allow us to express our opinions freely and easily to a vast number of people. In this study, we examine whether there are gender-based differences in how communication happens via Twitter in regard to soccer. Soccer is one of the most popular sports, and therefore, on social media, it engages a diverse audience regardless of their technical knowledge. We collected Twitter data for three months (March-June) for English and Portuguese that contains 9.5 million Tweets related to soccer, and only 18.38% tweets were identified as belonging to women, highlighting a possible gender gap already in the number of people who participated actively in this topic. We then conduct a fine-grained text-level and network-level analysis to identify the gender differences that might exist while communicating on Twitter. Our results show that women express their emotions more intensely than men, regardless of the differences in volume. The network generated from Portuguese has lower homophily than English. However, this difference in homophily does not impact how females express their emotions and sentiments, suggesting that these aspects are inherent norms or characteristics of genders. Our study unveils more gaps through qualitative and quantitative analyses, highlighting the importance of examining and reporting gender gaps in online communication to create a more inclusive space where people can openly share their opinions.</description>

      <title>Discovering Invariant Neighborhood Patterns for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of distribution shifts on non-homophilous graphs Mosting existing graph neural network methods rely on the homophilous assumption that nodes from the same class are more likely to be linked. However, such assumptions of homophily do not always hold in real-world graphs, which leads to more complex distribution shifts unaccounted for in previous methods. The distribution shifts of neighborhood patterns are much more diverse on non-homophilous graphs. We propose a novel Invariant Neighborhood Pattern Learning (INPL) to alleviate the distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive Neighborhood Propagation (ANP) module to capture the adaptive neighborhood information, which could alleviate the neighborhood pattern distribution shifts problem on non-homophilous graphs. We propose Invariant Non-Homophilous Graph Learning (INHGL) module to constrain the ANP and learn invariant graph representation on non-homophilous graphs. Extensive experimental results on real-world non-homophilous graphs show that INPL could achieve state-of-the-art performance for learning on large non-homophilous graphs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Latent Themes of Messaging on Social Media by Integrating LLMs: A Case Study on Climate Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to uncovering and analyzing themes in social media messaging. Recognizing the limitations of traditional topic-level analysis, which tends to capture only the overarching patterns, this study emphasizes the need for a finer-grained, theme-focused exploration. Conventional methods of theme discovery, involving manual processes and a human-in-the-loop approach, are valuable but face challenges in scalability, consistency, and resource intensity in terms of time and cost. To address these challenges, we propose a machine-in-the-loop approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allows for a deeper investigation into the thematic aspects of social media discourse, enabling us to uncover a diverse array of themes, each with unique characteristics and relevance, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the nuances present within broader topics. Furthermore, this method efficiently maps the text and the newly discovered themes, enhancing our understanding of the thematic nuances in social media messaging. We employ climate campaigns as a case study and demonstrate that our methodology yields more accurate and interpretable results compared to traditional topic models. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in uncovering latent themes but also illuminate how these themes are tailored for demographic targeting in social media contexts. Additionally, our work sheds light on the dynamic nature of social media, revealing the shifts in the thematic focus of messaging in response to real-world events.</description>

      <title>Edge Private Graph Neural Networks with Singular Value Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) play a key role in learning representations from graph-structured data and are demonstrated to be useful in many applications. However, the GNN training pipeline has been shown to be vulnerable to node feature leakage and edge extraction attacks. This paper investigates a scenario where an attacker aims to recover private edge information from a trained GNN model. Previous studies have employed differential privacy (DP) to add noise directly to the adjacency matrix or a compact graph representation. The added perturbations cause the graph structure to be substantially morphed, reducing the model utility. We propose a new privacy-preserving GNN training algorithm, Eclipse, that maintains good model utility while providing strong privacy protection on edges. Eclipse is based on two key observations. First, adjacency matrices in graph structures exhibit low-rank behavior. Thus, Eclipse trains GNNs with a low-rank format of the graph via singular values decomposition (SVD), rather than the original graph. Using the low-rank format, Eclipse preserves the primary graph topology and removes the remaining residual edges. Eclipse adds noise to the low-rank singular values instead of the entire graph, thereby preserving the graph privacy while still maintaining enough of the graph structure to maintain model utility. We theoretically show Eclipse provide formal DP guarantee on edges. Experiments on benchmark graph datasets show that Eclipse achieves significantly better privacy-utility tradeoff compared to existing privacy-preserving GNN training methods. In particular, under strong privacy constraints ($\epsilon$ &lt; 4), Eclipse shows significant gains in the model utility by up to 46%. We further demonstrate that Eclipse also has better resilience against common edge attacks (e.g., LPA), lowering the attack AUC by up to 5% compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Forward Learning of Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as recommendation, drug discovery, and question answering. Behind the success of GNNs lies the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the de facto standard for training deep neural networks (NNs). However, despite its effectiveness, BP imposes several constraints, which are not only biologically implausible, but also limit the scalability, parallelism, and flexibility in learning NNs. Examples of such constraints include storage of neural activities computed in the forward pass for use in the subsequent backward pass, and the dependence of parameter updates on non-local signals. To address these limitations, the forward-forward algorithm (FF) was recently proposed as an alternative to BP in the image classification domain, which trains NNs by performing two forward passes over positive and negative data. Inspired by this advance, we propose ForwardGNN in this work, a new forward learning procedure for GNNs, which avoids the constraints imposed by BP via an effective layer-wise local forward training. ForwardGNN extends the original FF to deal with graph data and GNNs, and makes it possible to operate without generating negative inputs (hence no longer forward-forward). Further, ForwardGNN enables each layer to learn from both the bottom-up and top-down signals without relying on the backpropagation of errors. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness and generality of the proposed forward graph learning framework. We release our code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/forwardgnn.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Higher-order Structural Information for Graph Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering holds profound significance in data mining. In recent years, graph convolutional network (GCN) has emerged as a powerful tool for deep clustering, integrating both graph structural information and node attributes. However, most existing methods ignore the higher-order structural information of the graph. Evidently, nodes within the same cluster can establish distant connections. Besides, recent deep clustering methods usually apply a self-supervised module to monitor the training process of their model, focusing solely on node attributes without paying attention to graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel graph clustering network to make full use of graph structural information. To capture the higher-order structural information, we design a graph mutual infomax module, effectively maximizing mutual information between graph-level and node-level representations, and employ a trinary self-supervised module that includes modularity as a structural constraint. Our proposed model outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, demonstrating its superiority.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network based Double Machine Learning Estimator of Network Causal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our paper addresses the challenge of inferring causal effects in social network data, characterized by complex interdependencies among individuals resulting in challenges such as non-independence of units, interference (where a unit's outcome is affected by neighbors' treatments), and introduction of additional confounding factors from neighboring units. We propose a novel methodology combining graph neural networks and double machine learning, enabling accurate and efficient estimation of direct and peer effects using a single observational social network. Our approach utilizes graph isomorphism networks in conjunction with double machine learning to effectively adjust for network confounders and consistently estimate the desired causal effects. We demonstrate that our estimator is both asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient. A comprehensive evaluation against four state-of-the-art baseline methods using three semi-synthetic social network datasets reveals our method's on-par or superior efficacy in precise causal effect estimation. Further, we illustrate the practical application of our method through a case study that investigates the impact of Self-Help Group participation on financial risk tolerance. The results indicate a significant positive direct effect, underscoring the potential of our approach in social network analysis. Additionally, we explore the effects of network sparsity on estimation performance.</description>

      <title>HateCOT: An Explanation-Enhanced Dataset for Generalizable Offensive Speech Detection via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitousness of social media has led to the need for reliable and efficient detection of offensive content to limit harmful effects. This has led to a proliferation of datasets and models related to detecting offensive content. While sophisticated models have attained strong performance on individual datasets, these models often do not generalize due to differences between how "offensive content" is conceptualized, and the resulting differences in how these datasets are labeled. In this paper, we introduce HateCOT, a dataset of 52,000 samples drawn from diverse existing sources with explanations generated by GPT-3.5-Turbo and human-curated. We show that pre-training models for the detection of offensive content on HateCOT significantly boots open-sourced Language Models on three benchmark datasets in both zero and few-shot settings, despite differences in domain and task.} We further find that HateCOT enables effective K-shot fine-tuning in the low-resource settings.</description>

      <title>Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning for Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-world semi-supervised learning (Open-world SSL) for node classification, that classifies unlabeled nodes into seen classes or multiple novel classes, is a practical but under-explored problem in the graph community. As only seen classes have human labels, they are usually better learned than novel classes, and thus exhibit smaller intra-class variances within the embedding space (named as imbalance of intra-class variances between seen and novel classes). Based on empirical and theoretical analysis, we find the variance imbalance can negatively impact the model performance. Pre-trained feature encoders can alleviate this issue via producing compact representations for novel classes. However, creating general pre-trained encoders for various types of graph data has been proven to be challenging. As such, there is a demand for an effective method that does not rely on pre-trained graph encoders. In this paper, we propose an IMbalance-Aware method named OpenIMA for Open-world semi-supervised node classification, which trains the node classification model from scratch via contrastive learning with bias-reduced pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on seven popular graph benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenIMA, and the source code has been available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Exploring Estonia's Open Government Data Development as a Journey towards Excellence: Unveiling the Progress of Local Governments in Open Data Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estonia has a global reputation of a digital state or e-country. However, despite the success in digital governance, the country has faced challenges in the realm of Open Government Data (OGD) area, with significant advancements in its OGD ecosystem, as reflected in various open data rankings from 2020 and onwards, in the recent years being recognized among trend-setters. This paper aims to explore the evolution and positioning of Estonia's OGD development, encompassing national and local levels, through an integrated analysis of various indices, primary data from the Estonian OGD portal, and a thorough literature review. The research shows that Estonia has made progress in the national level open data ecosystem, primarily due to improvements in the OGD portal usability and legislation amendments. However, the local level is not as developed, with local governments lagging behind in OGD provision. The literature review highlights the lack of previous research focusing on Estonian and European local open data, emphasizing the need for future studies to explore the barriers and enablers of municipal OGD. This study contributes to a nuanced understanding of Estonia's dynamic journey in the OGD landscape, shedding light on both achievements and areas warranting further attention for establishing a sustainable open data ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Beyond network centrality: Individual-level behavioral traits for predicting information superspreaders in social media</title>

Abstract: Understanding the heterogeneous role of individuals in large-scale information spreading is essential to manage online behavior as well as its potential offline consequences. To this end, most existing studies from diverse research domains focus on the disproportionate role played by highly-connected ``hub" individuals. However, we demonstrate here that information superspreaders in online social media are best understood and predicted by simultaneously considering two individual-level behavioral traits: influence and susceptibility. Specifically, we derive a nonlinear network-based algorithm to quantify individuals' influence and susceptibility from multiple spreading event data. By applying the algorithm to large-scale data from Twitter and Weibo, we demonstrate that individuals' estimated influence and susceptibility scores enable predictions of future superspreaders above and beyond network centrality, and reveal new insights on the network position of the superspreaders.</description>

Abstract: Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms steadily gain popularity as they provide users with fast responses to their queries. The swiftness of these responses is contingent on a mixture of query-specific and user-related elements. This paper scrutinizes these contributing factors within the context of six highly popular CQA platforms, identified through their standout answering speed. Our investigation reveals a correlation between the time taken to yield the first response to a question and several variables: the metadata, the formulation of the questions, and the level of interaction among users. Additionally, by employing conventional machine learning models to analyze these metadata and patterns of user interaction, we endeavor to predict which queries will receive their initial responses promptly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While numerous public blockchain datasets are available, their utility is constrained by an exclusive focus on blockchain data. This constraint limits the incorporation of relevant social network data into blockchain analysis, thereby diminishing the breadth and depth of insight that can be derived. To address the above limitation, we introduce EX-Graph, a novel dataset that authentically links Ethereum and X, marking the first and largest dataset of its kind. EX-Graph combines Ethereum transaction records (2 million nodes and 30 million edges) and X following data (1 million nodes and 3 million edges), bonding 30,667 Ethereum addresses with verified X accounts sourced from OpenSea. Detailed statistical analysis on EX-Graph highlights the structural differences between X-matched and non-X-matched Ethereum addresses. Extensive experiments, including Ethereum link prediction, wash-trading Ethereum addresses detection, and X-Ethereum matching link prediction, emphasize the significant role of X data in enhancing Ethereum analysis. EX-Graph is available at \url{https://exgraph.deno.dev/}.</description>

      <title>Online Misogyny Against Female Candidates in the 2022 Brazilian Elections: A Threat to Women's Political Representation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Technology-facilitated gender-based violence has become a global threat to women's political representation and democracy. Understanding how online hate affects its targets is thus paramount. We analyse 10 million tweets directed at female candidates in the Brazilian election in 2022 and examine their reactions to online misogyny. Using a self-trained machine learning classifier to detect Portuguese misogynistic tweets and a quantitative analysis of the candidates' tweeting behaviour, we investigate how the number of misogynistic attacks received alters the online activity of the female candidates. We find that young and left-wing candidates and candidates with higher visibility online received significantly more attacks. Furthermore, we find that an increase in misogynistic attacks in the previous week is associated with a decrease in female candidates' tweets in the following week. This potentially threatens their equal participation in public opinion building and silences women's voices in political discourse.</description>

      <title>Gun Culture in Fringe Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing frequency of mass shootings in the United States has, unfortunately, become a norm. While the issue of gun control in the US involves complex legal concerns, there are also societal issues at play. One such social issue is so-called "gun culture," i.e., a general set of beliefs and actions related to gun ownership. However relatively little is known about gun culture, and even less is known when it comes to fringe online communities. This is especially worrying considering the aforementioned rise in mass shootings and numerous instances of shooters being radicalized online.
  To address this gap, we explore gun culture on /k/, 4chan's weapons board. More specifically, using a variety of quantitative techniques, we examine over 4M posts on /k/ and position their discussion within the larger body of theoretical understanding of gun culture. Among other things, our findings suggest that gun culture on /k/ covers a relatively diverse set of topics (with a particular focus on legal discussion), some of which are signals of fetishism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in research on Deep Graph Networks (DGNs) has led to a maturation of the domain of learning on graphs. Despite the growth of this research field, there are still important challenges that are yet unsolved. Specifically, there is an urge of making DGNs suitable for predictive tasks on realworld systems of interconnected entities, which evolve over time. With the aim of fostering research in the domain of dynamic graphs, at first, we survey recent advantages in learning both temporal and spatial information, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in the domain of representation learning for dynamic graphs. Secondly, we conduct a fair performance comparison among the most popular proposed approaches on node and edge-level tasks, leveraging rigorous model selection and assessment for all the methods, thus establishing a sound baseline for evaluating new architectures and approaches</description>

      <title>Revealing behavioral impact on mobility prediction networks through causal interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. This study introduces a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thereby facilitating the simulation of diverse yet realistic spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Expressive Power of Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Eigenvalue Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spectral graph neural networks, characterized by polynomial filters, have garnered increasing attention and have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as node classification. These models typically assume that eigenvalues for the normalized Laplacian matrix are distinct from each other, thus expecting a polynomial filter to have a high fitting ability. However, this paper empirically observes that normalized Laplacian matrices frequently possess repeated eigenvalues. Moreover, we theoretically establish that the number of distinguishable eigenvalues plays a pivotal role in determining the expressive power of spectral graph neural networks. In light of this observation, we propose an eigenvalue correction strategy that can free polynomial filters from the constraints of repeated eigenvalue inputs. Concretely, the proposed eigenvalue correction strategy enhances the uniform distribution of eigenvalues, thus mitigating repeated eigenvalues, and improving the fitting capacity and expressive power of polynomial filters. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Criminal organizations exhibit hysteresis, resilience, and robustness by balancing security and efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between criminal organizations and law enforcement disruption strategies is crucial in criminology. Criminal enterprises, like legitimate businesses, balance visibility and security to thrive. This study uses evolutionary game theory to analyze criminal networks' dynamics, resilience to interventions, and responses to external conditions. We find strong hysteresis effects, challenging traditional deterrence-focused strategies. Optimal thresholds for organization formation or dissolution are defined by these effects. Stricter punishment doesn't always deter organized crime linearly. Network structure, particularly link density and skill assortativity, significantly influences organization formation and stability. These insights advocate for adaptive policy-making and strategic law enforcement to effectively disrupt criminal networks.</description>
