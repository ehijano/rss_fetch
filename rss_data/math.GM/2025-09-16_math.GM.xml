      <title>A Novel Extension of $S$-Metric Spaces with Application to Solving $n$th-Degree Polynomial Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel generalization of the classical concept of $S$-metric spaces, referred to as composed $S$-metric spaces. By incorporating a composed function, we impose more general conditions on the triangle inequality, extending the traditional framework. Using this newly defined structure, we establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points under suitable assumptions. Our results expand upon and generalize several established results in the literature across various types of spaces. To highlight the practical significance of our findings, we provide an example that demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results. This examples highlight the versatility and effectiveness of composed $S$-metric spaces in a range of mathematical contexts, particularly in solving $n$th degree polynomial equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a quadratic two-parameter matrix polynomial in Newton basis $Q_{N} (\lambda ,\mu)$, we construct a vector space of linear two-parameter matrix polynomials and identify a set of linearizations which lie in the vector space. We also describe construction of each of these linearizations.</description>

      <title>Linear Equations for Solving Partial Latin Squares and Sudokus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Latin squares the units (rows and columns) have fixed sum. The same holds for rows, columns, and blocks in Sudokus. Summing the elements of a unit yields a linear equation, and the set of all such equations forms a system of linear equations that models the relations of the variables in Latin squares and Sudoku puzzles. Every completed Latin square or Sudoku satisfies this system, enabling analysis and completion of partially filled puzzles. The linear system provides necessary but not sufficient conditions for a solution. We analyze the structure and rank of these systems and establish limits on their ability to uniquely determine solutions. For Latin squares of size $n \times n$ with $k$ unknowns and Sudokus with block size $n = m \cdot l$, the system has full rank only if \[ k \leq 2n - 1 \quad \text{(Latin squares)}, \qquad k \leq 2n - 1 + (l - 1)(m - 1) \quad \text{(Sudokus)}. \] These conditions are necessary for uniqueness under the linear model, though counterexamples exist. We also highlight that this system captures only one of the three relations known to puzzle solvers, requiring extensions with additional (nonlinear) constraints for complete solutions. Our analysis shows that certain partial Latin squares and Sudokus can be solved in polynomial time using Gaussian elimination, placing them in complexity class P, while the general completion problem remains NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Vizings Conjecture: A Density-Based Re-framing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10473v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an equivalent form of Vizing's conjecture gamma(G square H) &gt;= gamma(G)gamma(H) using a simple domination-density lens. Defining rho_G = gamma(G)/|V(G)|, the conjecture becomes rho_{G square H} &gt;= rho_G rho_H, that is, the domination density of the Cartesian product is equal to or larger than the product of the domination densities of the original graphs. Selecting valid upper bounds such that rho_G &lt;= rho tilde G, rho_H &lt;= rho tilde H and a product lower bound such that rho_{G square H} &gt;= rho tilde {G square H}, we obtain the simple test rho tilde {G square H} &gt;= rho tilde G rho tilde H which certifies Vizing's conjecture whenever it holds. Examples include: (i) bipartite graph pairs whose bipartitions are sufficiently uneven compared to the maximum degree, yielding infinite nontrivial families, and (ii) the Arnautov-Payan bound, which shows the conjecture holds for all k-regular pairs with k &gt;= 32. The framework is modular and the included bounds are general. Implementing increasingly sharp family-specific bounds can further expand the certified parameter regimes for which Vizing's conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Novelty from First-Appearance Times in the Calkin-Wilf Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first-appearance map $\pi:\mathbb{N}_{\ge2}\to\mathbb{N}_0$ that assigns to each denominator $d$ the earliest breadth-first index at which a reduced fraction of denominator $d$ occurs in the Calkin-Wilf enumeration of $\mathbb{Q}_{&gt;0}$. In parallel, we consider the elementary denominator-first array $D=\big(U(2)\mid U(3)\mid U(4)\mid\cdots\big)$ with rows $U(a)=(1/a,2/a,\dots,(a-1)/a)$ and row-starts $i_0(a)=\frac{(a-2)(a-1)}{2}$. We say level $a$ locks if $\pi(a)=i_0(a)$. Our main theorem is purely combinatorial: for every $n\ge2$ there exists $i\in\{0,\dots,n-2\}$ such that the first appearances of denominators $n-i$ and $n+i$ align symmetrically around $i_0(n)$, i.e.\ $\pi(n\pm i)=i_0(n)\pm i$. We prove this pairing (or simultaneous novelty) theorem via a local-coherence analysis of $\pi$ around a level and a discrete intermediate-value argument. An equivalent group-theoretic restatement uses the free monoid $\langle L,R\rangle\subset SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ underlying the Calkin-Wilf and Stern-Brocot trees.</description>

      <title>Relation-Theoretic Banach Contraction Principle in Topological Spaces with an Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we extend several relation-theoretic notions to topological spaces. We introduce relation preserving contraction mapping into topological spaces and utilize the same to extend Banach contraction principle in topological spaces employing a binary relation. To illustrate the validity of our main result, we provide a concrete example along with a MATLAB-based visualization of the convergence behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrated the applicability of our main result by finding a solution for a fractional differential equation under some suitable assumptions.</description>

      <title>A Type 2 Fuzzy Set Approach for Building Linear Linguistic Regression Analysis under Multi Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic algorithm for constructing a Type-2 Fuzzy Set of the Linear Linguistic Regression (T2F-LLR) model, designed to address uncertainty and vagueness in real-world decision-making. We consider a practical scenario involving a cosmetic company's promotional planning across four product categories: Basic Face Care, Face Cleaning, Cosmetics, and Body Care, aimed at both male and female consumers. Data are collected using fuzzy linguistic questionnaires from customers and expert managers, with responses expressed using qualitative terms such as 'always', 'frequently', 'Often', 'Sometimes', and 'frequently'. These linguistic evaluations are modeled as Type-2 Fuzzy Set of Linear Linguistic regression (T2F-LLR) variables to capture both randomness and higher-order fuzziness. We rigorously develop a solution framework based on a one-sigma confidence interval using the credibility measure to calculate the expected values and variances of the model output. To improve computational efficiency and usability of decisions, we introduce a heuristic algorithm tailored for non-meta datasets, significantly reducing the complexity of the model solving process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which yields a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of weight equals 7.97\% with all variables statistically significant. We also provide the significant results for each product using the one-way analysis of variance test (one-way ANOVA test) ($p$-value = 0.15) and the paired $t$ test ($p$-value = 0.16). The results show that there is no significant difference between observed and predicted weights overall. This paper provides a robust and interpretable methodology for decision makers dealing with imprecise data and time-sensitive planning.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Criterion Equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete dynamical system on the integers, defined by moving a composite $m$ forward to $m+\pi(m)$ and a prime $p$ backward to $p-\mathrm{prevprime}(p)$. This map produces trajectories whose contraction properties are closely tied to the distribution of primes.
  We prove unconditional contraction inequalities for error terms derived from these trajectories, using explicit remainder bounds from the smoothed explicit formula. Building on this, we show that the Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to a sharp contraction condition: the trajectory error functional satisfies $E(X)\ll X^{1/2}\log X$. The forward implication follows directly from von Koch's classical bound under RH. For the converse, we invoke the Landau--Littlewood $\Omega$-results, which guarantee that any off-critical zero forces oscillations large enough to violate the contraction inequality.
  This establishes a new dynamical reformulation of RH: the critical-line conjecture is equivalent to the assertion that integer trajectories remain uniformly contracted at the scale $X^{1/2}\log X$, equivalently, RH holds. The perspective is distinct from earlier analytic equivalents, as it arises from stability properties of a simple deterministic system rather than from Hilbert space or Dirichlet polynomial approximations.</description>

      <title>The Modular Energy Function: Exact Identities and a Primality Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the arithmetic function E_m(n), defined as the sum of the remainders of n when divided by the first m positive integers. Although the definition is elementary, the function encodes rich arithmetic structure. In this first part we develop exact algebraic and combinatorial identities, including floor-sum and divisor-sum reformulations, quotient-residue decompositions, sharp bounds and extremal classes, and symmetry relations. We also establish a diagonal identity linking E_n(n) to the classical sum of divisors function, which leads to an exact equivalence characterizing primality in terms of differences of modular energy values. Additional results include congruence decompositions, recursion formulas, and structural properties when n&lt;m, n&gt;m, or when n or m is prime. These identities form the foundation for a second part, where analytic and asymptotic properties will be investigated.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Selector Kernels, Duality, and Odd Zeta Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we develop trigonometric selector kernels to represent odd zeta values via dual hyperbolic counterparts. This framework highlights a Fourier-Poisson duality, incorporating finite-part integrals in the sense of Hadamard-Galapon. In particular, we show how such kernels naturally recover Euler-Maclaurin and Poisson summation formulas as dual manifestations. We further connect our kernel approach with the finite-part integral formulation, extending earlier Cvijovi\'c-Klinowski type representations for odd zeta values.</description>

      <title>On Characterizing Potential Friends of 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does $20$ have a friend? Or is it a solitary number? A folklore conjecture asserts that $20$ has no friends i.e. it is a solitary number. In this article, we prove that, a friend $N$ of $20$ is of the form $N=2\cdot5^{2a}\cdot m^2$, with $(3,m)=(7,m)=1$ and it has at least six distinct prime divisors. Furthermore, we show that $\Omega(N)\geq 2\omega(N)+6a-5$ and if $\Omega(m)\leq K$ then $N&lt; 10\cdot 6^{(2^{K-2a+3}-1)^2}$, where $\Omega(n)$ and $\omega(n)$ denote the total number of prime divisors and the number of distinct prime divisors of the integer $n$ respectively. In addition, we deduce that, not all exponents of odd prime divisors of friend $N$ of $20$ are congruent to $-1$ modulo $f$, where $f$ is the order of $5$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$ such that $3\mid f$ and $p$ is a prime congruent to $1$ modulo $6$. Also, we prove necessary upper bounds for all prime divisors of friends of 20 in terms of the number of divisors of the friend. In addition, we prove that, if $P$ is the largest prime divisor of $N$ then $P&lt;N^{\frac{1}{4}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22819v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new identity linking Bernoulli, Stirling (first kind), and Bessel (first kind) numbers: \[ \sum_{k=0}^{n} 2^{\,n-k}\,s(n,k)\,B_k \;=\; \sum_{k=0}^{n} b(n,k)\,\frac{(-1)^k\,k!}{k+1}. \] This parallels the classical Stirling--Bernoulli relation \[ B_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} S(n,k)\,\frac{(-1)^k\,k!}{k+1}, \] replacing $S(n,k)$ with $s(n,k)$ and $b(n,k)$, and thus revealing a new structural connection among these families of numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d_1 = 1 &lt; d_2 &lt; d_3 &lt; \cdots &lt; d_{\tau(n)} = n$ denote the increasing sequence of the divisors of a positive integer $n$. In this paper, for real or complex values of $\alpha$, we define and study some properties of two new divisor functions $\sigma_{e,\alpha}$ and $\sigma_{o,\alpha}$. The first computes the sum of the $\alpha$-th powers of the divisors of $n$ with even indices, and the second computes the sum of the $\alpha$-th powers of the divisors of $n$ with odd indices. We also introduce a new type of positive integers, namely, $k$-index ratio numbers and state three conjectures related to them.</description>
