      <title>Reducing the complexity of computing the values of a Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Colonel Blotto game, formulated by Emile Borel, involves players allocating limited resources to multiple battlefields simultaneously, with the winner being the one who allocates more resources to each battlefield. Computation of the Nash equilibrium, including of two person, zero sum, mixed strategy Colonel Blotto games have encountered issues of scalability and complexity owing to their PPAD completeness. This paper proposes an algorithm that computes the same value as the Nash equilibrium but cannot be characterized by the Fixed point Theorems of Tarski, Kakutani and Brouwer. The reduced complexity of the proposed algorithm is based on dispensing with the need for computing both players Nash strategies in Colonel Blotto games. The same algorithm can, therefore, be extended to all two person, zero sum games to compute the value of the Nash equilibrium. The theoretical superiority of the proposed algorithm over both LP solvers and another method that computes the same value of the game as its Nash equilibrium by a random assignment of probabilities to the active strategy set of the defending player, is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Successor Features for Transfer in Alternating Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores successor features for knowledge transfer in zero-sum, complete-information, and turn-based games. Prior research in single-agent systems has shown that successor features can provide a ``jump start" for agents when facing new tasks with varying reward structures. However, knowledge transfer in games typically relies on value and equilibrium transfers, which heavily depends on the similarity between tasks. This reliance can lead to failures when the tasks differ significantly. To address this issue, this paper presents an application of successor features to games and presents a novel algorithm called Game Generalized Policy Improvement (GGPI), designed to address Markov games in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed algorithm enables the transfer of learning values and policies across games. An upper bound of the errors for transfer is derived as a function the similarity of the task. Through experiments with a turn-based pursuer-evader game, we demonstrate that the GGPI algorithm can generate high-reward interactions and one-shot policy transfer. When further tested in a wider set of initial conditions, the GGPI algorithm achieves higher success rates with improved path efficiency compared to those of the baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Probing EFX via PMMS: (Non-)Existence Results in Discrete Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible items and provide new insights into the EFX problem, which is widely regarded as the central open question in fair division, and the PMMS problem, a strictly stronger variant of EFX. Our first result constructs a three-agent instance with two monotone valuations and one additive valuation in which no PMMS allocation exists. Since EFX allocations are known to exist under these assumptions, this establishes a formal separation between EFX and PMMS.
  We prove existence of fair allocations for three important special cases. We show that EFX allocations exist for personalized bivalued valuations, where for each agent $i$ there exist values $a_i &gt; b_i$ such that agent $i$ assigns value $v_i(\{g\}) \in \{a_i, b_i\}$ to each good $g$. We establish an analogous existence result for PMMS allocations when $a_i$ is divisible by $b_i$. We also prove that PMMS allocations exist for binary-valued MMS-feasible valuations, where each bundle $S$ has value $v_i(S) \in \{0, 1\}$. Notably, this result holds even without assuming monotonicity of valuations and thus applies to the fair division of chores and mixed manna. Finally, we study a class of valuations called pair-demand valuations, which extend the well-studied unit-demand valuations to the case where each agent derives value from at most two items, and we show that PMMS allocations exist in this setting. Our proofs are constructive, and we provide polynomial-time algorithms for all three existence results.</description>
