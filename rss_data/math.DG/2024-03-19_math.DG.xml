      <title>On an integrable class of Chebyshev nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider integrable curve nets in Euclidean space as a particular integrable geometry invariant with respect to rigid motions and net-preserving reparameterisations. For the purpose of their description, we first give an overview of the most important second-order invariants and relations among them. As a particular integrable example, we study curve nets satisfying an $\mathbb R$-linear relation between the Schief curvature of the net and the Gauss curvature of the supporting surface. Starting with an $\mathfrak{so}(3)$-valued zero-curvature representation, associated with an elliptic spectral curve, we reveal two cases when the curve degenerates. In one of these cases, when the curvatures are proportional (concordant nets), we find a correspondence to pairs of pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures. The construction generalises the well-known correspondence between translation surfaces and pairs of curves.</description>

      <title>Controllability and diffeomorphism groups on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with smooth boundary. We show that the diffeomorphism groups of the manifold and its boundary fit into a short exact sequence which admits local sections. In other words, they form an infinite-dimensional fibre bundle. Manifolds with boundary are of interest in numerical analysis and with a view towards applications in machine learning we establish controllability results for families of vector fields. This generalises older results due to Agrachev and Caponigro in the boundary-less case. Our results show in particular that the diffeomorphism group of a manifold with smooth boundary is generated by the image of the exponential map.</description>

      <title>Long time regularity of the $p$-Gauss curvature flow with flat side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the long time regularity of the interface in the $p$-Gauss curvature flow with flat side in all dimensions for $p&gt;\frac1n$. Here the interface is the boundary of the flat part in the flow. In dimension $2$, this problem was solved in \cite{DL2004} for $p=1$ and in \cite{KimLeeRhee2013} for $p\in(1/2,1)$. We utilize the duality method to transform the Gauss curvature flow to a singular parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation, and prove the regularity of the interface by studying the asymptotic cone of the parabolic Monge-Amp\`ere equation in the polar coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This short note provides a symplectic analogue of Vaisman's theorem in complex geometry. Namely, for any compact symplectic manifold satisfying the hard Lefschetz condition in degree 1, every locally conformally symplectic structure is in fact globally conformally symplectic, whenever there is a mutually compatible almost complex structure.</description>

      <title>Homotopy BV-algebras in Hermitian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the de Rham complex of any almost Hermitian manifold carries a natural commutative $BV_\infty$-algebra structure satisfying the degeneration property. In the almost K\"ahler case, this recovers Koszul's BV-algebra, defined for any Poisson manifold. As a consequence, both the Dolbeault and the de Rham cohomologies of any compact Hermitian manifold are canonically endowed with homotopy hypercommutative algebra structures, also known as formal homotopy Frobenius manifolds. Similar results are developed for (almost) symplectic manifolds with Lagrangian subbundles.</description>

      <title>Structural Validation Of Synthetic Power Distribution Networks Using The Multiscale Flat Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable.
  We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA.</description>

      <title>Determinants of pseudo-laplacians and $\zeta^{({\rm reg})}(1)$ for spinor bundles over Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a point of a Riemann surface $X$. We study self-adjoint extensions of Dolbeault Laplacians in hermitian line bundles $L$ over $X$ initially defined on sections with compact supports in $X\backslash\{P\}$. We define the $\zeta$-regularized determinants for these operators and derive the comparison formulas for them. We introduce the notion of the Robin mass of $L$. This quantity enters the comparison formulas for determinants and is related to the regularized $\zeta(1)$ for the Dolbeault Laplacian. For spinor bundles of even characteristic, we find the explicit expressions for the Robin mass.</description>

      <title>The Interplay Between Symmetries and Impact Effects on Hybrid Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid systems are dynamical systems with continuous-time and discrete-time components in their dynamics. When hybrid systems are defined on a principal bundle we are able to define two classes of impacts for the discrete-time transition of the dynamics: interior impacts and exterior impacts. In this paper we define hybrid systems on principal bundles, study the underlying geometry on the switching surface where impacts occur and we find conditions for which both exterior and interior impacts are preserved by the mechanical connection induced in the principal bundle.</description>

      <title>Geodesic vector fields, induced contact structures and tightness in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide new and simpler proofs of two theorems of Gluck and Harrison on contact structures induced by great circle or line fibrations. Furthermore, we prove that a geodesic vector field whose Jacobi tensor is parallel along flow lines (e.g. if the underlying manifold is locally symmetric) induces a contact structure if the 'mixed' sectional curvatures are nonnegative, and if a certain nondegeneracy condition holds. Additionally, we prove that in dimension three, contact structures admitting a Reeb flow which is either periodic, isometric, or free and proper, must be universally tight. In particular, we generalise an earlier result of Geiges and the author, by showing that every contact form on $\mathbb{R}^3$ whose Reeb vector field spans a line fibration is necessarily tight. Furthermore, we provide a characterisation of isometric Reeb vector fields. As an application, we recover a result of Kegel and Lange on Seifert fibrations spanned by Reeb vector fields, and we classify closed contact $3$-manifolds with isometric Reeb flows (also known as $R$-contact manifolds) up to diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Rotational hypersurfaces family satisfying $\mathbb{L}_{n-3}\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{A}\mathcal{G}$ in ${\mathbb{E}}^{n}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate rotational hypersurfaces family in $n$ -dimensional Euclidean space ${\mathbb{E}}^{n}$. Our focus is on studying the Gauss map $\mathcal{G}$ of this family with respect to the operator $\mathbb{L}_{k}$, which acts on functions defined on the hypersurfaces. The operator $\mathbb{L}_{k}$ can be viewed as a modified Laplacian and is known by various names, including the Cheng--Yau operator in certain cases. Specifically, we focus on the scenario where $k=n-3$ and $n\geq 3$. By applying the operator $\mathbb{L}_{n-3}$ to the Gauss map $\mathcal{G}$, we establish a classification theorem. This theorem establishes a connection between the $n\times n$ matrix $\mathcal{A}$, and the Gauss map $\mathcal{G}$ through the equation $\mathbb{L}_{n-3}\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{A}\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>The Chern Sectional Curvature of a Hermitian Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a Hermitian manifold, the Chern connection can induce a metric connection on the background Riemannian manifold. We call the sectional curvature of the metric connection induced by the Chern connection the Chern sectional curvature of this Hermitian manifold. First, we derive expression of the Chern sectional curvature in local complex coordinates. As an application, we find that a Hermitian metric is K\"ahler if the Riemann sectional curvature and the Chern sectional curvature coincide. As subsequent results, Ricci curvature and scalar curvature of the metric connection induced by the Chern connection are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive extrinsic GJMS operators and $Q$-curvatures associated to a submanifold of a conformal manifold. The operators are conformally covariant scalar differential operators on the submanifold with leading part a power of the Laplacian in the induced metric. Upon realizing the conformal manifold as the conformal infinity of an asymptotically Poincar\'e--Einstein space and the submanifold as the boundary of an asymptotically minimal submanifold thereof, these operators arise as obstructions to smooth extension as eigenfunctions of the Laplacian of the induced metric on the minimal submanifold. We derive explicit formulas for the operators of orders 2 and 4. We prove factorization formulas when the original submanifold is a minimal submanifold of an Einstein manifold. We also show how to reformulate the construction in terms of the ambient metric for the conformal manifold, and use this to prove that the operators defined by the factorization formulas are conformally invariant for all orders in all dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study almost rigidity properties of super Ricci flow whose Muller quantity is non-negative. We conclude almost splitting and quantitative stratification theorems that have been established by Bamler for Ricci flow. As a byproduct, we obtain an almost constancy for a certain integral quantity concerning scalar curvature at an almost selfsimilar point, which is new even for Ricci flow.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Spectral Flow for Families of Dirac-type Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the setting of a proper, cocompact action by a locally compact, unimodular group $G$ on a Riemannian manifold, we construct equivariant spectral flow of paths of Dirac-type operators. This takes values in the $K$-theory of the group $C^*$-algebra of $G$. In the case where $G$ is the fundamental group of a compact manifold, the summation map maps equivariant spectral flow on the universal cover to classical spectral flow on the base manifold. We obtain "index equals spectral flow" results. In the setting of a smooth path of $G$-invariant Riemannian metrics on a $G$-spin manifold, we show that the equivariant spectral flow of the corresponding path of spin Dirac operators relates delocalised $\eta$-invariants and $\rho$-invariants for different positive scalar curvature metrics to each other.</description>
