      <title>The Unsteady Taylor--Vortex Dynamo is Fast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical and geophysical fluids commonly generate organized magnetic fields, despite having enormous magnetic Reynolds numbers $\rm{Rm}$ and abundant small-scale turbulence. Flow-induced dynamo action produces these fields, with the ``kinematic dynamo problem'' devoted to determining the rate at which a flow exponentially amplifies weak magnetic fields. However, previous studies on high-Rm kinematic dynamos have generated flows via imposed volumetric forcing or oscillatory boundary conditions. In this letter, we investigate a system with three important attributes: realistic flow conditions, fast dynamo action (operational for $\rm{Rm}\to\infty$), and a subharmonic spatio-temporal structure. We show that unsteady Taylor--vortex flow, a regime observed in laboratory experiments, gives rise to fast dynamos with time and length scales twice those of the flow at high $\rm{Rm}$. By numerically integrating a Floquet system driven by periodic oscillations of Taylor vortices, we solve the kinematic dynamo problem up to $\rm{Rm} = 3.2 \cdot 10^6$, calculating the dynamo's growth rate as a function of Rm and streamwise wavenumber. We find the onset of instability and compute Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents, which identify the regions of Lagrangian chaos required for fast dynamo action. To our knowledge, unsteady Taylor--vortex flow produces the most physically motivated fast dynamo to date.</description>

      <title>Higher-order mean velocity profile in the convective atmospheric boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-order mean velocity profile in the convective atmospheric boundary layer (CBL) is derived using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The universal expansion coefficients are obtained using field measurement data. The profile accounts for the departures from the (leading-order) log law and local-free-convection scaling as well as the deviations from the Monin-Obukhov Similarity theory (MOST). Invoking MOST and the Multipoint Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, the perturbation equations are obtained from the Reynolds-stress, potential-temperature flux and potential temperature-variance budget equations and the mean momentum and mean potential temperature equations. The small parameters with the most impact in the equations are $(-z_i/L)^{-4/3}$, $(-z_i/L)^{-2/3}$ and $-h_0/L$, where $z_i$, $L$ and $h_0$ are the inversion height, the Obukhov length and the roughness height, respectively. Tong and Ding ({\it J.~Fluid Mech.} 2020) have identified the three-layer structure of the CBL In the present work, asymptotic matching between the outer and inner-outer layers also results in higher-order expansion terms. The expansion coefficients are obtained using measurement data from the recent M$^2$HATS field campaign. Comparisons between the expansions and the measurement show excellent agreement. The higher-order asymptotic expansions show that the convective logarithmic friction law derived by Tong and Ding (2020) is valid to at least the second order. The predicted friction law also agrees well with measurements. The higher-order mean velocity profile can provide improved accuracy over empirical profiles.</description>

      <title>Resolving Cryogenic and Hypersonic Rarefied Flows via Deep Learning-Accelerated Lennard-Jones DSMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating a physically realistic Lennard Jones LJ potential into Direct Simulation Monte Carlo DSMC has long been hindered by the high cost of evaluating detailed scattering dynamics. We present a high-fidelity, machine-learning-accelerated framework that bridges rigorous molecular physics and large-scale kinetic simulation, implemented within Bird standard DSMC algorithm suite. Two challenges are solved incorporating LJ consistent properties into DSMC total cross-section formulation, and replacing the expensive particle scattering step with a surrogate model. First, we develop a universal Variable Effective Diameter model via local viscosity matching, capturing attractive repulsive interactions over a wide temperature range an advance over traditional models restricted to narrow thermal bands. Second, we employ a Deep Operator Network as a fast, accurate substitute for the LJ scattering integral, enabling efficient high-precision collisions. The resulting framework exposes physical effects often missed by standard models and is validated on three canonical problems: shock waves in helium and argon, supersonic Couette flow with cryogenic walls, and hypersonic cylinder flow at two Mach numbers. In the argon shock case, we show that while the Variable Hard Sphere VHS model fails to match the experimental density profile, its velocity distribution function closely follows the LJ prediction. In low temperature supersonic Couette flow, the LJ model predicts smaller shear stress than VHS, underscoring the dominant influence of long-range attractive forces in cryogenic shear layers.</description>

      <title>Instability of microbial droplets growing on viscous substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a model for a flat microbial droplet growing on the surface of a three-dimensional viscous fluid. The model describes growth-induced stresses at the fluid surface, density variations in the bulk due to nutrient consumption, and the resulting fluid flows that arise. We reformulate this free-boundary problem as a system of integro-differential equations defined solely on the microbial domain. From this formulation, we identify an axisymmetric solution corresponding to a radially expanding disk and analyze its morphological stability. We find that growth forces stabilize the axisymmetric solution while buoyancy forces destabilize it. We connect these findings to experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Causally coherent structures in turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extraction of spatio-temporal coherence in high-dimensional, chaotic, non-linear dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows, remains a fundamental challenge in physics, mathematics and engineering. In this work, we employ Shannon transfer entropy (TE) to identify causally coherent motions in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL). This causality metric, rooted in information theory, enables the identification of sources and targets in dynamical systems using the corresponding time series. However, TE requires sophisticated tuning of various hyperparameters, such as the Markovian order of the source ($m$), which can spatially vary in wall-bounded turbulent flow. Here, we present an adaptive tuning and discuss the influence of $m$ across different TBLs. We introduce the concept of causally coherent structures (CCS), i.e. coherent structures interpreted as spatio-temporal patterns of causality. Moreover, the net transfer entropy flux is also utilised to identify boundary layer locations acting either as sources or targets. The standard viscous, logarithmic, and outer layers are characterised by information fluxes, highlighting, for example, dominant top-down interactions between the inner and outer layers, analogously to the classical energy cascade. This work extends techniques previously employed in the literature, such as correlation and spectral analysis, and presents an approach that is inherently general and applicable to a wide range of chaotic dynamical systems, with applications in cognitive sciences, systems biology and finance.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Adjoint Data Assimilation for Two-Dimensional Decaying Isotropic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjoint-based data assimilation for turbulent Navier-Stokes flows is fundamentally limited by the behavior of the adjoint dynamics: in backward time, adjoint fields exhibit exponential growth and become increasingly dominated by small-scale structures, severely degrading reconstruction of the initial condition from sparse measurements. We demonstrate that the relative weighting of spectral components in the adjoint formulation can be systematically controlled by redefining the inner product under which the adjoint operator is defined. The inverse problem is formulated as a constrained minimization in which a cost functional measures the mismatch between model predictions and observations, and the adjoint equations provide the gradient with respect to the initial velocity field. Redefining the forward-adjoint duality through a Fourier-space weighting kernel preconditions the optimization and is mathematically equivalent to changing the representation of the control variable or, alternatively, introducing a smoothing operation on the governing dynamics. Specific kernel choices correspond to fractional integration or diffusion operators applied to the initial condition. Among these, exponential kernels provide effective regularization by suppressing high-wavenumber contributions while preserving large-scale coherence, leading to improved reconstruction across scales. A statistical analysis of an ensemble of adjoint fields from different turbulent realizations reveals scale-dependent backward growth rates, explaining the instability of the standard formulation and clarifying the mechanism by which the proposed preconditioning attenuates incoherent small-scale amplification.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact on surfactant-laden thin liquid films: Vortex ring dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impact on surfactant-laden thin liquid films is investigated experimentally with emphasis on vortex ring dynamics. Bottom- and side-view imaging reveal that increasing surfactant concentration progressively stabilize vortex rings, suppress azimuthal instabilities and promote concentric mixing patterns. A regime map is established in terms of film thickness, Reynolds number, and surface-tension ratio, yielding an empirical instability threshold. Shadowgraphy observations suggest that Marangoni stresses modify early capillary-wave dynamics, potentially altering vortex ring formation and delaying instability onset. These findings clarify the link between interfacial stresses, vortex ring dynamics, and mixing patterns in thin-film droplet impact.</description>

      <title>Wavemaker and endogeneity of gravitationally stretched weakly viscoelastic jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly stretched capillary jets produced by gravity are central to drop generation, micro-thread formation, and extensional-rheometry concepts. For Newtonian fluids, the transition from steady jetting to self-excited oscillations in a gravitationally stretched jet is predicted accurately by one-dimensional slender-jet equations that retain the exact interfacial curvature and admit a global eigenvalue analysis Rubio-Rubio et al. 2013. Separately, weakly viscoelastic jets governed by Oldroyd--B/Giesekus constitutive laws exhibit elastocapillary regimes and beads-on-a-string dynamics that are well captured by one-dimensional free-surface models Ardekani et al. 2010. Here we formulate a unified one-dimensional model for gravitationally stretched viscoelastic jets, combining full-curvature capillarity with a Giesekus stress closure, and we analyse its global linear stability on spatially developing base states. We first benchmark the Newtonian limit, reproducing marginal spectra and base-flow profiles, and then quantify how elasticity shifts the critical jetting--dripping boundary by tracking the leading global Hopf eigenpair across the rheological parametric space. For experimentally relevant moderate elasticity, characterised by order-unity Deborah numbers, polymeric tension modifies both the critical Weber number and the selected oscillation frequency, and endogeneity decompositions reveal that marginality results from a balance between capillary/kinematic contributions and an additional elastic-stress feedback pathway. To interpret and predict the onset mechanism, we compute wavemakers and receptivity/structural-sensitivity fields from direct--adjoint eigenfunctions, showing that viscoelasticity broadens the sensitivity region downstream while the adjoint remains strongly localized near the inlet, thereby identifying the near-nozzle region as the dominant receptive location.</description>

      <title>Recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and test a recursive regularised lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. The approach is based on a double-distribution formulation, in which the magnetic field is evolved using a standard BGK lattice Boltzmann scheme, while the fluid solver is enhanced through a Hermite-based recursive regularisation of the non-equilibrium moments. The method exploits a fourth-order Hermite expansion of the equilibrium distribution on the D2Q9 lattice, allowing higher-order isotropy to be retained while selectively filtering spurious non-hydrodynamic contributions. The regularisation procedure reconstructs the non-equilibrium distribution from physically consistent Hermite coefficients, avoiding explicit evaluation of velocity gradients. The resulting scheme preserves the correct incompressible MHD limit, improves numerical stability at low viscosities, and reduces lattice-dependent artefacts. The proposed formulation provides a robust and versatile framework for MHD simulations and offers a systematic route for extending regularised lattice Boltzmann methods to coupled multiphysics systems.</description>

      <title>Fluidic Shaping over arbitrary domains: theory and high order finite-elements solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluidic Shaping is a novel method for fabrication of optical components based on the equilibrium state of liquid volumes in neutral buoyancy, subjected to geometrical constraints. The underlying physics of this method is described by a highly nonlinear partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and an integral constraint. To date, useful solutions for such optical liquid surfaces could be obtained analytically only for the linearized equations and only on circular or elliptical domains. A numerical solution for the non-linear equation was suggested, but only for the axi-symmetric case. Such solutions are, however, insufficient as they do not capture the full range of optical surfaces. Arbitrary domains offer an important degree of freedom for creating complex optical surfaces, and the nonlinear terms are essential for high quality solutions. Moreover, in the context of optics, it is not sufficient to resolve the shape of the surface, and it is essential to obtain accurate solutions for its curvature, which governs its optical properties. We here present the theoretical foundation for the Fluidic Shaping method over arbitrary domains, and the development of a high order (quintic) finite element numerical solver, capable of accurately resolving the topography and curvature of liquid interfaces on arbitrary domains. The code is based on reduced quintic finite elements, which we have modified to capture curved boundaries. We compare the results against low order finite elements and non-deformed high order elements, demonstrating the importance of high order approximations of both the solution and the domain. We also show the usability of the code for the prediction of optical surfaces derived from complex boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based Shape Optimization, Machine Learning based Surrogate Models, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), Voith Schneider propulsion (VSP), Self-propelled Ship, Propulsion Model, Hull Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjoint-based shape optimization of ship hulls is a powerful tool for addressing high-dimensional design problems in naval architecture, particularly in minimizing the ship resistance. However, its application to vessels that employ complex propulsion systems introduces significant challenges. They arise from the need for transient simulations extending over long periods of time with small time steps and from the reverse temporal propagation of the primal and adjoint solutions. These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system. The surrogate model replicates the time-averaged flow field induced by a Voith Schneider Propeller and replaces the geometrically and time-resolved propeller with a data-driven approximation. Primal flow verification examples demonstrate that the surrogate model achieves significant computational savings while maintaining the necessary accuracy of the resolved propeller. Optimization studies show that ignoring the propulsion system can yield designs that perform worse than the initial shape. In contrast, the proposed method produces shapes that achieve more than an 8\% reduction in resistance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using clean numerical simulation (CNS) which can give very accurate spatiotemporal trajectory of Navier-Stokes turbulence in a finite but long enough interval of time, we give some numerical evidences that the Navier-Stokes equations admit distinct global solutions from almost the same initial conditions whose difference is very small, i.e. even at the order $10^{-40}$ of magnitude. Hopefully these examples could provide some enlightenments for the uniqueness and existence of Navier-Stokes equations, which are related to one Millennium Prize Problem of Clay Institute.</description>

      <title>Shape, confinement and inertia effects on the dynamics of a driven spheroid in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of anisotropic particles in viscous flows underpin a wide range of processes in soft matter, microfluidics, and targeted drug delivery. Here, we investigate the motion of externally driven prolate and oblate spheroids suspended in a Newtonian fluid and confined within a square microchannel. Using lattice Boltzmann simulations, complemented by far-field hydrodynamic theory based on superposition of wall interactions, we systematically quantify how particle aspect ratio, strength of confinement, and fluid inertia influence the dynamics of a spheroid. For unconfined spheroids, we show that the translational velocity is maximized not for a sphere but for a prolate (end-on) or oblate (broadside-on) spheroid of a specific aspect ratio. Under confinement, the optimal aspect ratio shifts toward oblate shapes due to the dominant contribution of wall-induced frictional resistance. Off-center positioning introduces strong translation-rotation coupling, giving rise to two families of oscillatory trajectories - glancing and reversing - whose existence and structure are captured as closed orbits in phase space. Weak fluid inertia breaks these closed loops: glancing trajectories spiral outward and merge with reversing trajectories, and new stable fixed points emerge. Together, these results reveal how modest deviations from sphericity or creeping-flow conditions profoundly alter the dynamics of driven particles in confined geometries. The predictions offer guidelines for optimizing particle shape in microfluidic transport and highlight the rich nonlinear behavior accessible in confined suspensions of nonspherical colloids.</description>

      <title>Leveling of MHD turbulence imbalance in shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in plane shear flows with a streamwise background magnetic field in the super-Alfv\'enic regime. We show that the large-scale velocity shear suppresses turbulence imbalance, driving the system toward a balanced state -- the energies of counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves become essentially equal, even at initially perfectly imbalanced Alfv\'enic turbulence. This balancing is due to the shear-induced linear non-modal dynamics of Alfv\'en waves, including their transient growth and over-reflection. This linear route to balancing turbulence is new -- fundamentally different from nonlinear ones operative in shearless MHD turbulence -- and have direct implications for understanding balanced/imbalanced MHD turbulence in the solar wind, which is modeled as a shear flow in a thermodynamically complex plasma.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Physics-Informed PointNets for Modeling Flows Across Porous Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting flows that occur both through and around porous bodies is challenging due to coupled physics across fluid and porous regions and the need to generalize across diverse geometries and boundary conditions. We address this problem using two Physics Informed learning approaches: Physics Informed PointNets (PIPN) and Physics Informed Geometry Aware Neural Operator (P-IGANO). We enforce the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in the free-flow region and a Darcy Forchheimer extension in the porous region within a unified loss and condition the networks on geometry and material parameters. Datasets are generated with OpenFOAM on 2D ducts containing porous obstacles and on 3D windbreak scenarios with tree canopies and buildings. We first verify the pipeline via the method of manufactured solutions, then assess generalization to unseen shapes, and for PI-GANO, to variable boundary conditions and parameter settings. The results show consistently low velocity and pressure errors in both seen and unseen cases, with accurate reproduction of the wake structures. Performance degrades primarily near sharp interfaces and in regions with large gradients. Overall, the study provides a first systematic evaluation of PIPN/PI-GANO for simultaneous through-and-around porous flows and shows their potential to accelerate design studies without retraining per geometry.</description>

      <title>Perturbation analysis of triadic resonance in columnar vortices: selection rules and the roles of external forcing and critical layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable robustness of isolated columnar vortices suggests the existence of fundamental constraints that prevent spontaneous disintegration. In this work, we investigate the weakly nonlinear stability of such flows, demonstrating that the triadic resonance of wave modes is governed by a set of hydrodynamic ``selection rules''. By employing a multi-scale perturbation analysis, we prove that resonant interactions between smooth neutral modes, specifically regular Kelvin waves and discrete critical layer modes with passive singularities, are strictly conservative and confined to the Manley--Rowe relations. Using wave pseudoenergy within a large-$k$ WKBJ framework, we show that these rules topologically prohibit intrinsic instability, analogous to the forbidden transitions of quantum mechanics. Consequently, the breakdown of a columnar vortex requires a specific symmetry-breaking mechanism to overcome this barrier. We identify and analyse two distinct pathways for this violation: (1) \textit{Parametric instability}, where external forcing acts as an active energy pump; using a robust tuning method based on non-degenerate perturbation theory, we generalize classical elliptical instability to arbitrary driving frequencies and identify new instability configurations involving dicrete critical layer modes. (2) \textit{Active critical layers}, where an embedded singularity breaks the Hermitian symmetry of the operator, enabling the extraction of mean-flow energy via a wave-mean resonance. These findings provide a theoretical guidance for flow control, suggesting that the mitigation of aircraft wake vortices requires either tuned external forcing or the ``engineering'' of critical layers (e.g., via thermal stratification) to trigger the forbidden transitions.</description>

      <title>Boundary-velocity error and stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for a small velocity error of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the boundary-velocity error and numerical stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the velocity error of the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal boundary-velocity error.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of transitional flows based on disturbance magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel stability criterion for incompressible shear flows by combining input-output analysis and the small-gain theorem. The criterion yields an explicit threshold on the magnitude of velocity perturbations about a given base flow that guarantees stability. If this threshold is crossed--either due to nonmodal growth, exponential growth, or a bypass transition scenario--our analysis predicts a loss of stability that may lead to transition to turbulence. We consider three approximated models for nonlinearity: unstructured, structured with non-repeated blocks, and structured with repeated blocks. We show that the imposed threshold obtained by these three methods complies with a hierarchical relationship, where the unstructured case is the most conservative, imposing the lowest bound on disturbance magnitude. We apply this approach to three canonical and well-studied base flows: Couette, plane Poiseuille, and Blasius. For these three base flows, we compare our results with experiments, direct numerical simulation results, nonmodal nonlinear stability results, and linear stability theory (LST). In the limit of infinitesimally small perturbation magnitude, our stability criterion for the unstructured case recovers the results of LST. For finite perturbations, the structured cases that account for nonlinear interactions provided stability thresholds that are consistent with experimental observations and simulation results of transition at both subcritical and post-critical Reynolds numbers for the considered base flows in our study. In particular, we utilize our stability criterion to demonstrate that Couette flow can become unstable and transition can be triggered at different Reynolds numbers, which is consistent with past experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Self-avoiding fluid deformable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for fluid deformable surfaces governed by surface Stokes flow and Helfrich bending energy under active growth, aiming to model shape evolution of the epithelium in developmental processes. To prevent self-intersections, which commonly arise under large deformations or low enclosed volume to area ratios, we incorporate the nonlocal tangent-point energy to penalize non-embedded configurations. The resulting formulation is discretized using higher order surface finite elements, with a parallelizable assembly strategy for the nonlocal terms. To tailor mesh quality to the geometric evolution, we propose a curvature-adaptive mesh redistribution strategy that improves mesh resolution in regions of high curvature. Numerical examples include the discocyte-to-stomatocyte transition and the inversion of a sphere within a spherical confinement. Both demonstrate the robustness of the method in capturing large deformations, self-avoidance, symmetry-breaking and growth-induced morphology changes.</description>

      <title>Vortex breakdown and its topologies in turbulent flows within a typical swirl combustor geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate vortex breakdown (VB) and its dominant topologies in turbulent, non-reacting flows within a canonical swirl combustor using large-eddy simulations (LES). A baseline configuration and operating conditions are first used to validate the LES solver, then five additional cases differing only by swirler vane-angle are simulated. The onset of VB is quantified using the generic swirl-number formulation, SNg, by detecting an internal recirculation zone (IRZ) in the mean flow, excluding highly-intermittent VB cases. Analysis of the mean flow shows that SNg measured within 40 mm downstream of swirler best represents the flow's swirl-strength compared with commonly used alternatives. A stable-VB first appears in the flow with 25{\deg} vane-angle, SNg=0.35. Q-criterion iso-surfaces and velocity time-series at VC footprints show a single-helix VC to prevail across all investigated vane-angles; up to 60{\deg}, SNg=1.15. Weaker double-helix signatures also appear, resulting from quadratic self-interaction of single-helix tone for vane-angles &lt;= 50{\deg}. They are quadratically independent in 60{\deg} case, indicating association with a distinct helical hydrodynamic mode. Axisymmetric IRZ oscillations interact with helical-VC dynamics in 25{\deg} and 60{\deg} cases. VC precesses as stable limit-cycle oscillation via a marginally stable mode in 40{\deg} to 50{\deg} cases, while it waxes and wanes strongly in 25{\deg} and 60{\deg} cases driven by stochastic forcing of a slightly stable mode. Alongside the coherent VC-strand, a weakly-coherent strand originates from swirler. Its precession frequency matches with the lowest coherent precession frequency, corroborating its precession-based origin. Overall, we establish critical-values, evaluation locations and a topology-map for predicting and interpreting VB-states in isothermal swirl combustor flows.</description>

      <title>Uncovering bistability phenomena in two-layer Couette flow experiments using nonlocal evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of interfacial long waves in two-layer plane Couette flow using a nonlinear, nonlocal asymptotic model derived from the Navier-Stokes equations and valid for thin upper layers. Nonlocality enters through a coupling of the thin and main layers, and crucial inertial effects are retained. The models generically support bistability phenomena observed in experiments where two stable travelling waves, one unimodal and the other bimodal, are recorded at the same lid velocity. In direct comparisons with experiments, the models show remarkable agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The two stable travelling waves are identified and their basins of attraction characterised via large-time computations for different initial conditions. We also identify a new symmetry-breaking travelling-wave branch bifurcating from the bimodal family, compute higher-wavenumber travelling-wave branches, and present time-periodic orbits arising via Hopf bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Predicting liquid properties and behavior via droplet pinch-off and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate that the time-evolving interface observed during droplet formation, and consequently the resulting morphology nearing pinch-off, encode sufficient physical information for machine-learning (ML) frameworks to accurately infer key fluid properties, including viscosity and surface tension. Snapshots of dripping drops at the moment of break-up, together with their liquid properties and the flow rate, are used to form a data set for training ML algorithms. Experiments consisted of visualizing, using high-speed imaging, the process of droplet formation and identifying the frame closest to break-up. Experiments were conducted using Newtonian fluids under controlled flow conditions. In terms of the Reynolds (Re) and Ohnesorge (Oh) numbers, our conditions cover the domains 0.001&lt; Re&lt; 200 and 0.01 &lt; Oh &lt; 20, by using silicon oils, aqueous solutions of ethanol and glycerin, and methanol. For each case, flow parameters were recorded, along with images capturing the final stages of droplet break-up. Supervised regression models were trained to predict fluid parameters from the extracted contours of the breaking droplets. Our data set contains 840 examples. Our results demonstrate that the droplet geometry at pinch-off contains sufficient information to infer fluid properties by machine learning approaches. Our methods can predict surface tension, viscosity, or the droplet shape at pinch-off. These approaches provide alternatives to conventional methods to measure liquid properties while reducing measurement complexity and evaluation time and facilitating integration into automation. Unsupervised clustering is performed; the clusters represent regions in the Re-Oh and Bo-Oh planes, indicating that the latent representation may reveal physical properties and offering insight into droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Covariant Chu-Kovasznay Decomposition: Resolving Thermodynamic Ambiguity in Compressible Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the Covariant Chu--Kovasznay Decomposition (CCKD), a geometric framework that resolves thermodynamic ambiguity in compressible mode content by formulating the decomposition on the effective acoustic spacetime. Enforcing orthogonality in the covariant Chu energy norm, we show that shock--turbulence interaction, often treated as a scattering source, is, in the idealized linear, inviscid setting, a near-unitary (Chu-isometric) scattering map constrained by conservation of covariant Chu-energy flux. In the canonical Shu-Osher problem, CCKD characterizes the shock as a thermo-acoustic lens, mathematically demonstrating that the transfer of entropy fluctuations into sound follows a geometric blue-shift ($k_{\mathrm{out}}=\Lambda k_{\mathrm{in}}$) analogous to gravitational blue-shift. Thus, while the mean flow produces entropy across the shock, the fluctuation mapping is information-preserving on the retained subspace; practical information loss arises from noise, truncation, and model mismatch, not shock physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

      <title>LAViG-FLOW: Latent Autoregressive Video Generation for Fluid Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling and forecasting subsurface multiphase fluid flow fields underpin applications ranging from geological CO2 sequestration (GCS) operations to geothermal production. This is essential for ensuring both operational performance and long-term safety. While high fidelity multiphase simulators are widely used for this purpose, they become prohibitively expensive once many forward runs are required for inversion purposes and to quantify uncertainty. To tackle this challenge, we propose LAViG-FLOW, a latent autoregressive video generation diffusion framework that explicitly learns the coupled evolution of saturation and pressure fields. Each state variable is compressed by a dedicated 2D autoencoder, and a Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT) models their coupled distribution across time. We first train the model on a given time horizon to learn their coupled relationship and then fine-tune it autoregressively so it can extrapolate beyond the observed time window. Evaluated on an open-source CO2 sequestration dataset, LAViG-FLOW generates saturation and pressure fields that stay consistent across time while running two orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers.</description>
