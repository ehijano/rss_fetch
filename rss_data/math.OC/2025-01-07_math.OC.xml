      <title>A car-following framework for traffic instability and lane changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a computational framework based on a car-following model to study traffic instability and lane changes. Building upon Newell's classical first-order car-following model, we show that, both analytically and numerically, there exists a vehicle-density-dependent critical reaction time that determines the stability of single-lane traffic. Specifically, perturbations to the equilibrium system decay with time for low reaction time and grow for high reaction time. This critical reaction time converges to Newell's original result in the continuum limit. Additionally, we propose a psychology-based lane-changing mechanism that builds a quantitative connection between the driver's psychological factor (frustration level) and the driving condition. We show that our stochastic lane-changing model can faithfully reproduce interesting phenomena like load-balancing of different lanes. Our model supports the result that more frequent lane changes only marginally benefit the driver's overall velocity.</description>

      <title>From Data to Combinatorial Multivector field Through an Optimization-Based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends and generalizes previous works on constructing combinatorial multivector fields from continuous systems (see [10]) and the construction of combinatorial vector fields from data (see [2]) by introducing an optimization based framework for the construction of combinatorial multivector fields from finite vector field data. We address key challenges in convexity, computational complexity and resolution, providing theoretical guarantees and practical methodologies for generating combinatorial representation of the dynamics of our data.</description>

      <title>Generalized Twice Differentiability and Quadratic Bundles in Second-Order Variational Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the concepts of generalized twice differentiability and quadratic bundles of nonsmooth functions that have been very recently proposed by Rockafellar in the framework of second-order variational analysis. These constructions, in contrast to second-order subdifferentials, are defined in primal spaces. We develop new techniques to study generalized twice differentiability for a broad class of prox-regular functions, establish their novel characterizations. Subsequently, quadratic bundles of prox-regular functions are shown to be nonempty, which provides the ground of potential applications in variational analysis and optimization.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Modeling and Decomposition of Hierarchical Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic modeling approach for hierarchical optimization that leverages the OptiGraph abstraction implemented in the ${\tt Julia}$ package ${\tt Plasmo.jl}$. We show that the abstraction is flexible and can effectively capture complex hierarchical connectivity that arises from decision-making over multiple spatial and temporal scales (e.g., integration of planning, scheduling, and operations in manufacturing and infrastructures). We also show that the graph abstraction facilitates the conceptualization and implementation of decomposition and approximation schemes. Specifically, we propose a graph-based Benders decomposition (gBD) framework that enables the exploitation of hierarchical (nested) structures and that uses graph aggregation/partitioning procedures to discover such structures. In addition, we provide a ${\tt Julia}$ implementation of gBD, which we call ${\tt PlasmoBenders.jl}$. We illustrate the capabilities using examples arising in the context of energy and power systems.</description>

      <title>ItsDEAL: Inexact two-level smoothing descent algorithms for weakly convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with nonconvex optimization problems via a two-level smoothing framework in which the high-order Moreau envelope (HOME) is applied to generate a smooth approximation of weakly convex cost functions. As such, the differentiability and weak smoothness of HOME are further studied, as is necessary for developing inexact first-order methods for finding its critical points. Building on the concept of the inexact two-level smoothing optimization (ItsOPT), the proposed scheme offers a versatile setting, called Inexact two-level smoothing DEscent ALgorithm (ItsDEAL), for developing inexact first-order methods: (i) solving the proximal subproblem approximately to provide an inexact first-order oracle of HOME at the lower-level; (ii) developing an upper inexact first-order method at the upper-level. In particular, parameter-free inexact descent methods (i.e., dynamic step-sizes and an inexact nonmonotone Armijo line search) are studied that effectively leverage the weak smooth property of HOME. Although the subsequential convergence of these methods is investigated under some mild inexactness assumptions, the global convergence and the linear rates are studied under the extra Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (KL) property. In order to validate the theoretical foundation, preliminary numerical experiments for robust sparse recovery problems are provided which reveal a promising behavior of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quadratic Penalty Method for a Class of Graph Clustering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community-based graph clustering is one of the most popular topics in the analysis of complex social networks. This type of clustering involves grouping vertices that are considered to share more connections, whereas vertices in different groups share fewer connections. A successful clustering result forms densely connected induced subgraphs. This paper studies a specific form of graph clustering problems that can be formulated as semi-assignment problems, where the objective function exhibits block properties. We reformulate these problems as sparse-constrained optimization problems and relax them to continuous optimization models. We apply a quadratic penalty method to the relaxation problem and solve the nonlinear quadratic penalty subproblem with simple box constraints using a projected gradient method based on the active set. Extensive numerical results indicate that our method provides more accurate clustering results for solving graph clustering problems at a faster speed, both for synthetic graphs and real-world network datasets, particularly in large-scale cases.</description>

      <title>A min-max reformulation and proximal algorithms for a class of structured nonsmooth fractional optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of structured nonsmooth fractional minimization, where the first part of the objective is the ratio of a nonnegative nonsmooth nonconvex function to a nonnegative nonsmooth convex function, while the second part is the difference of a smooth nonconvex function and a nonsmooth convex function. This model problem has many important applications, for example, the scale-invariant sparse signal recovery in signal processing. However, the existing methods for fractional programs are not suitable for solving this problem due to its special structure. We first present a novel nonfractional min-max reformulation for the original fractional program and show the connections between their global (local) optimal solutions and stationary points. Based on the reformulation, we propose an alternating maximization proximal descent algorithm and show its subsequential convergence towards a critical point of the original fractional program under a mild assumption. By further assuming the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property of an auxiliary function, we also establish the convergence of the entire solution sequence generated by the proposed algorithm. Finally, some numerical experiments on the scale-invariant sparse signal recovery are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Towards a constructive framework for control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.</description>

      <title>Complete systems of inequalities relating the perimeter, the area and the Cheeger constant of planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The object of the paper is to find complete systems of inequalities relating the perimeter $P$, the area $|\cdot|$ and the Cheeger constant $h$ of planar sets. To do so, we study the so called Blaschke--Santal\'o diagram of the triplet $(P,h,|\cdot|)$ for different classes of domains: simply connected sets, convex sets and convex polygons with at most $N$ sides. We completely determine the diagram in the latter cases except for the class of convex $N$-gons when $N\ge 5$ is odd: therein, we show that the boundary of the diagram is given by the graphs of two continuous and strictly increasing functions. An explicit formula for the lower one and a numerical method to obtain the upper one is provided. At last, some applications of the results are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the possible values taken by the pair $(\lambda_1(\Omega), \mu_1(\Omega))$ the first eigenvalues of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions respectively of a bounded plane domain $\Omega$. We prove that, without any particular assumption on the class of open sets $\Omega$, the two classical inequalities (the Faber-Krahn inequality and the Weinberger inequality) provide a complete system of inequalities. Then we consider the case of convex plane domains for which we give new inequalities for the product $\lambda_1 \mu_1$. We plot the so-called Blaschke--Santal\'o diagram and give some conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that among all doubly connected domains of $\mathbb{R}^n$ of the form $B_1\backslash \overline{B_2}$, where $B_1$ and $B_2$ are open balls of fixed radii such that $\overline{B_2}\subset B_1$, the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue achieves its maximal value uniquely when the balls are concentric. Furthermore, we show that the ideas of our proof also apply to a mixed boundary conditions eigenvalue problem found in literature.</description>

Abstract: This article presents a discussion of optimization problems where the objective function f(x) has parameters that are constrained by some scaling, so that q(x) = constant, where this function q() involves a sum of the parameters, their squares, or similar simple function. Our focus is on ways to use standardized optimization programs to solve such problems rather than specialized codes. Examples are presented with R.</description>

      <title>An Improved Metaheuristic Algorithm for On-site Workshop Availability Cost Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-mode Resource Availability Cost Problem (MRACP) optimizes resource availability to minimize usage costs and is a recent project scheduling problem variant. The Multi-Mode On-Site Workshop Availability Cost Problem (MOSWACP) extends MRACP by introducing spatial constraints for On-site Workshops (OSWs) at construction sites. MOSWACP aims to determine the optimal availability level, installation, and dismantling times for OSWs while scheduling activities within spatial and resource limitations. A novel Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed, and a metaheuristic algorithm, the Electron Radar Search Algorithm (ERSA), is proposed to solve large-scale instances. ERSA, enhanced with problem-specific operators, outperforms CPLEX in large instances and outperforms Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). An actual case study demonstrated significant cost savings using the proposed model. The results and conclusions highlight the effectiveness of the ERSA approach in managing complex project scheduling challenges.</description>

      <title>The robust selection problem with information discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a multiple-stage variant of the min-max robust selection problem with budgeted uncertainty that includes queries. First, one queries a subset of items and gets the exact values of their uncertain parameters. Given this information, one can then choose the set of items to be selected, still facing uncertainty on the unobserved parameters. In this paper, we study two specific variants of this problem. The first variant considers objective uncertainty and focuses on selecting a single item. The second variant considers constraint uncertainty instead, which means that some selected items may fail. We show that both problems are NP-hard in general. We also propose polynomial-time algorithms for special cases of the sets of items that can be queried. For the problem with constraint uncertainty, we also show how the objective function can be expressed as a linear program, leading to a mixed-integer linear programming reformulation for the general case. We illustrate the performance of this formulation using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Major-minor mean field games: common noise helps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to study the existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibria in mean field games involving a major player and a continuum of minor players over finite intervals of arbitrary length. Following earlier articles addressing similar questions in the context of classical mean field games, the cost functions for the minor players are assumed to satisfy the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition. In this contribution, we demonstrate that if, in addition to the monotonicity condition, the intensity of the (Brownian) noise driving the major player is sufficiently high, then -- under further mild regularity assumptions on the coefficients -- existence, uniqueness, and stability of equilibria are guaranteed. A key challenge is to show that the threshold (beyond which the noise intensity must be taken) can be chosen independently of the length of the time interval over which the game is defined. Building on the stability properties thus established, we further show that the associated system of master equations admits a unique classical solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind for major-minor mean field games defined over intervals of arbitrary length.</description>

      <title>Approximate Dynamic Programming for a Remanufacture-to-Order System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remanufacturing is pivotal in transitioning to more sustainable economies. While industry evidence highlights its vast market potential and economic and environmental benefits, remanufacturing remains underexplored in theoretical research. This study revisits a state-of-the-art remanufacture-to-order (RtO) system and develops an alternative approach by developing an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to solve larger RtO instances. The proposed methodology yields results consistent with existing state-dependent, non-congestive policies. Key findings include the optimality of fulfilling demand whenever remanufacturable cores are available and prioritizing cores of the highest quality level. This work highlights the potential of ADP in addressing problems in remanufacturing domains.</description>

Abstract: Gradient descent algorithms perform well in convex optimization but can get tied for finding local minima in non-convex optimization. A robust method that combines a spectral approach with nonmonotone line search strategy for solving variational inclusion problems is proposed. Spectral properties using eigenvalues information are used for accelerating the convergence. Nonmonotonic behaviour is exhibited to relax descent property and escape local minima. Nonmonotone spectral conditions leverage adaptive search directions and global convergence for the proposed spectral subgradient algorithm.</description>

      <title>Douglas-Rachford algorithm for nonmonotone multioperator inclusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Douglas-Rachford algorithm is a classic splitting method for finding a zero of the sum of two maximal monotone operators. It has also been applied to settings that involve one weakly and one strongly monotone operator. In this work, we extend the Douglas-Rachford algorithm to address multioperator inclusion problems involving $m$ ($m\geq 2$) weakly and strongly monotone operators, reformulated as a two-operator inclusion in a product space. By selecting appropriate parameters, we establish the convergence of the algorithm to a fixed point, from which solutions can be extracted. Furthermore, we illustrate its applicability to sum-of-$m$-functions minimization problems characterized by weakly convex and strongly convex functions. For general nonconvex problems in finite-dimensional spaces, comprising Lipschitz continuously differentiable functions and a proper closed function, we provide global subsequential convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Constrained Multi-Modal Density Control of Linear Systems via Covariance Steering Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate finite-horizon optimal density steering problems for discrete-time stochastic linear dynamical systems whose state probability densities can be represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our goal is to compute optimal controllers that can ensure that the terminal state distribution will match the desired distribution exactly (hard-constrained version) or closely (soft-constrained version) where in the latter case we employ a Wasserstein like metric that can measure the distance between different GMMs. Our approach relies on a class of randomized control policies which allow us to reformulate the proposed density steering problems as finite-dimensional optimization problems, and in particular, linear and bilinear programs. Additionally, we explore more general density steering problems based on the approximation of general distributions by GMMs and characterize bounds for the error between the terminal distribution under our policy and the approximated GMM terminal state distribution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through non-trivial numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Improved Approximation Algorithms for Low-Rank Problems Using Semidefinite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the impact of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on combinatorial optimization, we construct an analogous relax-then-sample strategy for low-rank optimization problems. First, for orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization problems, we derive a semidefinite relaxation and a randomized rounding scheme, which obtains provably near-optimal solutions, mimicking the blueprint from Goemans and Williamson for the Max-Cut problem. We then extend our approach to generic low-rank optimization problems by developing new semidefinite relaxations that are both tighter and more broadly applicable than those in prior works. Although our original proposal introduces large semidefinite matrices as decision variables, we show that most of the blocks in these matrices can be safely omitted without altering the optimal value, hence improving the scalability of our approach. Using several examples (including matrix completion, basis pursuit, and reduced-rank regression), we show how to reduce the size of our relaxation even further. Finally, we numerically illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of our relaxation and our sampling scheme on orthogonally constrained quadratic optimization and matrix completion problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we examine impulsive evolution systems in Hilbert spaces. Using a resolvent-like operator, we first establish the finite-approximate controllability for linear systems. Subsequently, by applying the Schauder fixed-point theorem (SFPT), we prove the existence of a solution and demonstrate the finite-approximate controllability of semilinear impulsive systems in Hilbert spaces. Finally, we extend these results to a broader application, specifically to the heat equation.</description>

      <title>Normalizations of factorizations over convex cones and their effects on extension complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factorizations over cones and their duals play central roles for many areas of mathematics and computer science. One of the reasons behind this is the ability to find a representation for various objects using a well-structured family of cones, where the representation is captured by the factorizations over these cones. Several major questions about factorizations over cones remain open even for such well-structured families of cones as non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones. Having said that, we possess a far better understanding of factorizations over non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones than over other families of cones. One of the key properties that led to this better understanding is the ability to normalize factorizations, i.e., to guarantee that the norms of the vectors involved in the factorizations are bounded in terms of an input and in terms of a constant dependent on the given cone. Our work aims at understanding which cones guarantee that factorizations over them can be normalized, and how this effects extension complexity of polytopes over such cones.</description>

      <title>Testing Approximate Stationarity Concepts for Piecewise Affine Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the basic computational problem of detecting approximate stationary points for continuous piecewise affine (PA) functions. Our contributions span multiple aspects, including complexity, regularity, and algorithms. Specifically, we show that testing first-order approximate stationarity concepts, as defined by commonly used generalized subdifferentials, is computationally intractable unless P=NP. To facilitate computability, we consider a polynomial-time solvable relaxation by abusing the convex subdifferential sum rule and establish a tight characterization of its exactness. Furthermore, addressing an open issue motivated by the need to terminate the subgradient method in finite time, we introduce the first oracle-polynomial-time algorithm to detect so-called near-approximate stationary points for PA functions.
  A notable byproduct of our development in regularity is the first necessary and sufficient condition for the validity of an equality-type (Clarke) subdifferential sum rule. Our techniques revolve around two new geometric notions for convex polytopes and may be of independent interest in nonsmooth analysis. Moreover, some corollaries of our work on complexity and algorithms for stationarity testing address open questions in the literature. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we complement our findings with applications to a series of structured piecewise smooth functions, including $\rho$-margin-loss SVM, piecewise affine regression, and nonsmooth neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a stochastic optimal feedback control problem for the controlled stochastic partial differential equations. More precisely, we establish the existence of stochastic optimal feedback control for the controlled stochastic partial differential equations with fully monotone coefficients by a minimizing sequence for the control problem. Using the Faedo-Galerkin approximations, the uniform estimates and the tightness in some appropriate space for the Faedo-Galerkin approximating solution can be obtain to prove the well-posedness of the controlled stochastic partial differential equations with fully monotone coefficients. The results obtained in the present paper may be applied to various types of controlled stochastic partial differential equations, such as the controlled stochastic convection diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma in Evolutionary Algorithms: A Novel Human-Centered Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are powerful tools for tackling complex computational problems, yet effectively managing the exploitation and exploration dynamics -- crucial for robust search navigation -- remains a persistent challenge for EA designers, and leads to the so-called exploration-exploitation dilemma. In this paper, a new human-centered framework is proposed to resolve this dilemma. Unlike the traditional approach, the search process will not be compromised of a single-phase nor the decision-maker tuning efforts will be distributed among the algorithm's traditional parameters such as defining new evolutionary operators internal to the algorithm to influence its search navigation. Instead, a human-centered two-phase search process, compromised of a global search phase followed by a local phase will be utilized. In this framework, the designer plays the central role in directing the algorithm's search navigation through the focused tuning efforts of a new Search Space Size Control parameter external to the algorithm which proves itself to be the dominant parameter in-effect to the algorithm's effective search navigation.
  The framework is applicable to any search algorithm. We demonstrate its effectiveness on 14 well-known benchmark problems in unconstrained optimization.</description>

      <title>Model-Free and Real-Time Bioinspired Unicycle-Based Source Seeking: Differential Wheeled Robotic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioinspred robots aimed at source-seeking are often studied, and their controls designed, using unicycle modeling and formulation. This is true not only for model-based controllers, but also for model-free, real-time control methods such as extremum seeking control (ESC). In this paper, we propose a unicycle-based ESC design applicable to differential wheeled robots that: (1) is very simple design, based on one simple control-affine law, and without state integrators; (2) attenuates oscillations known to persist in ESC designs (i.e., fully stop at the source); and (3) operates in a model-free, real-time setting, tolerating environmental/sensor noise. We provide simulation and real-world robotic experimental results for fixed and moving light source seeking by a differential wheeled robot using our proposed design. Results indicate clear advantages of our proposed design when compared to the literature, including attenuation of undesired oscillations, improved convergence speed, and better handling of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the robust multi-dimensional scaling (RMDS) problem in this paper. The goal is to localize point locations from pairwise distances that may be corrupted by outliers. Inspired by classic MDS theories, and nonconvex works for the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) problem, we propose an alternating projection based algorithm that is further accelerated by the tangent space projection technique. For the proposed algorithm, if the outliers are sparse enough, we can establish linear convergence of the reconstructed points to the original points after centering and rotation alignment. Numerical experiments verify the state-of-the-art performances of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A parameterized linear formulation of the integer hull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$ be an integer matrix with components bounded by $\Delta$ in absolute value. Cook et al.~(1986) have shown that there exists a universal matrix $B \in \mathbb{Z}^{m' \times n}$ with the following property: For each $b \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, there exists $t \in \mathbb{Z}^{m'}$ such that the integer hull of the polyhedron $P = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Ax \leq b\}$ is described by $P_I = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \colon Bx \leq t\}$. Our \emph{main result} is that $t$ is an \emph{affine} function of $b$ as long as $b$ is from a fixed equivalence class of the lattice $D \cdot \mathbb{Z}^m$. Here $D \in \mathbb{N}$ is a number that depends on $n$ and $\Delta$ only. Furthermore, $D$ as well as the matrix $B$ can be computed in time depending on $\Delta$ and $n$ only. An application of this result is the solution of an open problem posed by Cslovjecsek et al.~(SODA 2024) concerning the complexity of \emph{2-stage-stochastic integer programming} problems. The main tool of our proof is the classical theory of \emph{Gomory-Chv\'atal cutting planes} and the \emph{elementary closure} of rational polyhedra.</description>

      <title>$\K$-Lorentzian and $\K$-CLC Polynomials in Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the class of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials, a generalization of the distinguished class of Lorentzian polynomials. As shown in \cite{GPlorentzian}, the set of $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials is equivalent to the set of $\K$-completely log-concave (aka $\K$-CLC) forms. Throughout this paper, we interchangeably use the terms $\K$-Lorentzian polynomials for the homogeneous setting and $\K$-CLC polynomials for the non-homogeneous setting. By introducing an alternative definition of $\K$-CLC polynomials through univariate restrictions, we establish that any strictly $\K$-CLC polynomial of degree $d \leq 4$ is Hurwitz-stable polynomial over $\K$. Additionally, we characterize the conditions under which a strictly $\K$-CLC of degree $d \geq 5$ is Hurwitz-stable over $\K$. Furthermore, we associate the largest possible proper cone, denoted by $\K(f,v)$, with a given $\K$-Lorentzian polynomial $f$ in the direction $v \in \inter \K$. Finally, we investigate applications of $\K$-CLC polynomials in the stability analysis of evolution variational inequalities (EVI) dynamical systems governed by differential equations and inequality constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal Response for Hyperbolic Systems by the fast adjoint response method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a uniformly hyperbolic system, we consider the problem of finding the optimal infinitesimal perturbation to apply to the system, from a certain set $P$ of feasible ones, to maximally increase the expectation of a given observation function. We perturb the system both by composing with a diffeomorphism near the identity or by adding a deterministic perturbation to the dynamics. In both cases, using the fast adjoint response formula, we show that the linear response operator, which associates the response of the expectation to the perturbation on the dynamics, is bounded in terms of the $C^{1,\alpha}$ norm of the perturbation. Under the assumption that $P$ is a strictly convex, closed subset of a Hilbert space $\cH$ that can be continuously mapped in the space of $C^3$ vector fields on our phase space, we show that there is a unique optimal perturbation in $P$ that maximizes the increase of the given observation function. Furthermore since the response operator is represented by a certain element $v$ of $\cH$, when the feasible set $P$ is the unit ball of $\cH$, the optimal perturbation is $v/||v||_{\cH}$. We also show how to compute the Fourier expansion $v$ in different cases. Our approach can work even on high dimensional systems. We demonstrate our method on numerical examples in dimensions 2, 3, and 21.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore two fundamental theorems of differential calculus: Rolle's Theorem and the Mean Value Theorem (MVT). These theorems play a crucial role in the development of theoretical and practical results in mathematics, serving as the basis for various applications in analysis and modeling of real-world phenomena. Initially, we present the formal statements and their respective analytical proofs, highlighting the mathematical rigor necessary for understanding them. Additionally, we discuss the geometric interpretation of both theorems, emphasizing their importance in understanding properties of differentiable functions. The goal of this work is not only to validate these theorems through analytical methods but also to perform their computational verification, providing an integrated view between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ Regret: Decoupling Learning and Decision-making in Online Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing efficient first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success of first-order methods, they typically achieve a regret no better than $\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt{T} )$, which is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O} (\log T)$ bound guaranteed by the state-of-the-art linear programming (LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes a general framework that improves upon the $\mathcal{O} ( \sqrt{T} )$ result when the LP dual problem exhibits certain error bound conditions. For the first time, we show that first-order learning algorithms achieve $o( \sqrt{T} )$ regret in the continuous support setting and $\mathcal{O} (\log T)$ regret in the finite support setting beyond the non-degeneracy assumption. Our results significantly improve the state-of-the-art regret results and provide new insights for sequential decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a qualitative analysis of the optimisation of space-time periodic principal eigenvalues. Namely, considering a fixed time horizon $T$ and the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, let, for any $m\in L^\infty((0,T)\times\mathbb{T}^d)$, $\lambda(m)$ be the principal eigenvalue of the operator $\partial_t-\Delta-m$ endowed with (time-space) periodic boundary conditions. The main question we set out to answer is the following: how to choose $m$ so as to minimise $\lambda(m)$? This question stems from population dynamics. We prove that in several cases it is always beneficial to rearrange $m$ with respect to time in a symmetric way, which is the first comparison result for the rearrangement in time of parabolic equations. Furthermore, we investigate the validity (or lack thereof) of Talenti inequalities for the rearrangement in time of parabolic equations. The numerical simulations which illustrate our results were obtained by developing a framework within which it is possible to optimise criteria with respect to functions having a prescribed rearrangement (or distribution function).</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum State Reconstruction with Structured Classical Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) remains the prevailing method for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices; however, its application to large quantum systems is rendered impractical due to the exponential growth in both the required number of total state copies and classical computational resources. Recently, the classical shadow (CS) method has been introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, capable of accurately predicting key quantum state properties. Despite its advantages, a critical question remains as to whether the CS method can be extended to perform QST with guaranteed performance. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a projected classical shadow (PCS) method with guaranteed performance for QST based on Haar-random projective measurements. PCS extends the standard CS method by incorporating a projection step onto the target subspace. For a general quantum state consisting of $n$ qubits, our method requires a minimum of $O(4^n)$ total state copies to achieve a bounded recovery error in the Frobenius norm between the reconstructed and true density matrices, reducing to $O(2^n r)$ for states of rank $r&lt;2^n$ -- meeting information-theoretic optimal bounds in both cases. For matrix product operator states, we demonstrate that the PCS method can recover the ground-truth state with $O(n^2)$ total state copies, improving upon the previously established Haar-random bound of $O(n^3)$. Simulation results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCS method.</description>

      <title>Integrated investment, retrofit and abandonment energy system planning with multi-timescale uncertainty using stabilised adaptive Benders decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the REORIENT (REnewable resOuRce Investment for the ENergy Transition) model for energy systems planning with the following novelties: (1) integrating capacity expansion, retrofit and abandonment planning, and (2) using multi-horizon stochastic mixed-integer linear programming with multi-timescale uncertainty. We apply the model to the European energy system considering: (a) investment in new hydrogen infrastructures, (b) capacity expansion of the European power system, (c) retrofitting oil and gas infrastructures in the North Sea region for hydrogen production and distribution, and abandoning existing infrastructures, and (d) long-term uncertainty in oil and gas prices and short-term uncertainty in time series parameters. We utilise the structure of multi-horizon stochastic programming and propose a stabilised adaptive Benders decomposition to solve the model efficiently. We first conduct a sensitivity analysis on retrofitting costs of oil and gas infrastructures. We then compare the REORIENT model with a conventional investment planning model regarding costs and investment decisions. Finally, the computational performance of the algorithm is presented. The results show that: (1) when the retrofitting cost is below 20% of the cost of building new ones, retrofitting is economical for most of the existing pipelines, (2) platform clusters keep producing oil due to the massive profit, and the clusters are abandoned in the last investment stage, (3) compared with a traditional investment planning model, the REORIENT model yields 24% lower investment cost in the North Sea region, and (4) the enhanced Benders algorithm is up to 6.8 times faster than the level method stabilised adaptive Benders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework that represents a dynamic program as a family of operators acting on a partially ordered set. We provide an optimality theory based only on order-theoretic assumptions and show how applications across almost all subfields of dynamic programming fit into this framework. These range from traditional dynamic programs to those involving nonlinear recursive preferences, desire for robustness, function approximation, Monte Carlo sampling and distributional dynamic programs. We apply the framework to establish new optimality and algorithmic results for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Subdifferential Optimality Conditions in Nonsmooth Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to deriving novel second-order necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for local minimizers in rather general classes of nonsmooth unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in finite-dimensional spaces. The established conditions are expressed in terms of second-order subdifferentials of lower semicontinuous functions and mainly concern prox-regular objectives that cover a large territory in nonsmooth optimization and its applications. Our tools are based on the machinery of variational analysis and second-order generalized differentiation. The obtained general results are applied to problems of nonlinear programming, where the derived second-order optimality conditions are new even for problems with twice continuously differential data, being expressed there in terms of the classical Hessian matrices.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization Schemes for Performative Prediction with Nonconvex Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a risk minimization problem with decision dependent data distribution. The problem pertains to the performative prediction setting in which a trained model can affect the outcome estimated by the model. Such dependency creates a feedback loop that influences the stability of optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present the first study on performative prediction with smooth but possibly non-convex loss. We analyze a greedy deployment scheme with SGD (SGD-GD). Note that in the literature, SGD-GD is often studied with strongly convex loss. We first propose the definition of stationary performative stable (SPS) solutions through relaxing the popular performative stable condition. We then prove that SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution in expectation. We consider two conditions of sensitivity on the distribution shifts: (i) the sensitivity is characterized by Wasserstein-1 distance and the loss is Lipschitz w.r.t.~data samples, or (ii) the sensitivity is characterized by total variation (TV) divergence and the loss is bounded. In both conditions, the bias levels are proportional to the stochastic gradient's variance and sensitivity level. Our analysis is extended to a lazy deployment scheme where models are deployed once per several SGD updates, and we show that it converges to an SPS solution with reduced bias. Numerical experiments corroborate our theories.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient arc-search interior-point algorithm for nonlinear constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes an arc-search interior-point algorithm for the nonlinear constrained optimization problem. The proposed algorithm uses the second-order derivatives to construct a search arc that approaches the optimizer. Because the arc stays in the interior set longer than any straight line, it is expected that the scheme will generate a better new iterate than a line search method. The computation of the second-order derivatives requires to solve the second linear system of equations, but the coefficient matrix of the second linear system of equations is the same as the first linear system of equations. Therefore, the matrix decomposition obtained while solving the first linear system of equations can be reused. In addition, most elements of the right-hand side vector of the second linear system of equations are already computed when the coefficient matrix is assembled. Therefore, the computation cost for solving the second linear system of equations is insignificant and the benefit of having a better search scheme is well justified. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established. Some preliminary test results are reported to demonstrate the merit of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical guarantees for the robust solution of inverse problems have important implications for applications. To achieve both guarantees and high reconstruction quality, we propose learning a pixel-based ridge regularizer with a data-dependent and spatially varying regularization strength. For this architecture, we establish the existence of solutions to the associated variational problem and the stability of its solution operator. Further, we prove that the reconstruction forms a maximum-a-posteriori approach. Simulations for biomedical imaging and material sciences demonstrate that the approach yields high-quality reconstructions even if only a small instance-specific training set is available.</description>

      <title>On Representing Convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs via Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) involve finding a solution within a convex feasible region defined by quadratic constraints while minimizing a convex quadratic objective function. These problems arise in various industrial applications, including power systems and signal processing. Traditional methods for solving convex QCQPs primarily rely on matrix factorization, which quickly becomes computationally prohibitive as the problem size increases. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for their potential in representing and solving various optimization problems such as linear programs and linearly constrained quadratic programs. In this work, we are the first to investigate the representation power of GNNs in the context of QCQP tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tripartite graph representation for general convex QCQPs and properly associate it with message-passing GNNs. We demonstrate that there exist GNNs capable of reliably representing key properties of convex QCQPs, including feasibility, optimal value, and optimal solution. Our result deepens the understanding of the connection between QCQPs and GNNs, paving the way for future machine learning approaches to efficiently solve QCQPs.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of using experimental time-series data for parameter estimation in nonlinear ordinary differential equations, focusing on the case where the data is noisy, sparse, irregularly sampled, includes multiple experiments, and does not directly measure the system state or its time-derivative. To account for such low-quality data, we propose a new framework for gradient-based parameter estimation which uses the Picard operator to reformulate the problem as constrained optimization with infinite-dimensional variables and constraints. We then use the contractive properties of the Picard operator to propose a class of gradient-contractive algorithms and provide conditions under which such algorithms are guaranteed to converge to a local optima. The algorithms are then tested on a battery of models and variety of datasets in order to demonstrate robustness and improvement over alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with an unknown linear constraint using a membership oracle that, given a solution, determines whether it is feasible or infeasible with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we adapt a classical framework in order to solve the problem by learning and exploiting a surrogate linear constraint. The resulting new framework includes training a linear separator on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, one can consider using SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on the pure knapsack problem and on a college study plan problem from the literature to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of objective value.</description>

      <title>Reducing Matroid Optimization to Basis Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matroids provide one of the most elegant structures for algorithm design. This is best identified by the Edmonds-Rado theorem relating the success of the simple greedy algorithm to the anatomy of the optimal basis of a matroid [Edm71; Rad57]. As a response, much energy has been devoted to understanding a matroid's computational properties. Yet, less is understood where parallel algorithms are concerned. In response, we initiate the study of parallel matroid optimization in the adaptive complexity model [BS18]. First, we reexamine Bor\r{u}vka's classical minimum weight spanning tree algorithm [Bor26b; Bor26a] in the abstract language of matroid theory, and identify a new certificate of optimality for the basis of any matroid as a result. In particular, a basis is optimal if and only if it contains the points of minimum weight in every circuit of the dual matroid. Hence, we can witnesses whether any specific point belongs to the optimal basis via a test for local optimality in a circuit of the dual matroid, thereby revealing a general design paradigm towards parallel matroid optimization. To instantiate this paradigm, we use the special structure of a binary matroid to identify an optimization scheme with low adaptivity. Here, our key technical step is reducing optimization to the simpler task of basis search in the binary matroid, using only logarithmic overhead of adaptive rounds of queries to independence oracles. Consequentially, we compose our reduction with the parallel basis search method of [KUW88] to obtain an algorithm for finding the optimal basis of a binary matroid terminating in sublinearly many adaptive rounds of queries to an independence oracle. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first algorithm for matroid optimization to outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of adaptive complexity in the independence query model without assuming the matroid is encoded by a graph.</description>

      <title>Riemann Sum Optimization for Accurate Integrated Gradients Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used algorithm for attributing the outputs of a deep neural network to its input features. Due to the absence of closed-form integrals for deep learning models, inaccurate Riemann Sum approximations are used to calculate IG. This often introduces undesirable errors in the form of high levels of noise, leading to false insights in the model's decision-making process. We introduce a framework, RiemannOpt, that minimizes these errors by optimizing the sample point selection for the Riemann Sum. Our algorithm is highly versatile and applicable to IG as well as its derivatives like Blur IG and Guided IG. RiemannOpt achieves up to 20% improvement in Insertion Scores. Additionally, it enables its users to curtail computational costs by up to four folds, thereby making it highly functional for constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Network Partitioning for Solution of Potential-Driven, Steady-State Nonlinear Network Flow Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solution of potential-driven steady-state flow in large networks is a task which manifests in various engineering applications, such as transport of natural gas or water through pipeline networks. The resultant system of nonlinear equations depends on the network topology and in general there is no numerical algorithm that offers guaranteed convergence to the solution (assuming a solution exists). Some methods offer guarantees in cases where the network topology satisfies certain assumptions, but these methods fail for larger networks. On the other hand, the Newton-Raphson algorithm offers a convergence guarantee if the starting point lies close to the (unknown) solution. It would be advantageous to compute the solution of the large nonlinear system through the solution of smaller nonlinear sub-systems wherein the solution algorithms (Newton-Raphson or otherwise) are more likely to succeed. This article proposes and describes such a procedure, an hierarchical network partitioning algorithm that enables the solution of large nonlinear systems corresponding to potential-driven steady-state network flow equations.</description>

      <title>Explicit and data-Efficient Encoding via Gradient Flow</title>

Abstract: The autoencoder model typically uses an encoder to map data to a lower dimensional latent space and a decoder to reconstruct it. However, relying on an encoder for inversion can lead to suboptimal representations, particularly limiting in physical sciences where precision is key. We introduce a decoder-only method using gradient flow to directly encode data into the latent space, defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This approach eliminates the need for approximate encoder inversion. We train the decoder via the adjoint method and show that costly integrals can be avoided with minimal accuracy loss. Additionally, we propose a $2^{nd}$ order ODE variant, approximating Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent for faster convergence. To handle stiff ODEs, we use an adaptive solver that prioritizes loss minimization, improving robustness. Compared to traditional autoencoders, our method demonstrates explicit encoding and superior data efficiency, which is crucial for data-scarce scenarios in the physical sciences. Furthermore, this work paves the way for integrating machine learning into scientific workflows, where precise and efficient encoding is critical. \footnote{The code for this work is available at \url{https://github.com/k-flouris/gfe}.}</description>

      <title>The Restricted Inverse Optimal Value Problem under Weighted Bottle-neck Hamming distance on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Restricted Inverse Optimal Value Problem (RIOVSP) on trees under weighted bottleneck Hamming distance, denoted as (RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). The problem aims to minimize the total cost under weighted bottle-neck Hamming distance such that the length of the shortest root-leaf path of the tree is lower-bounded by a given value by adjusting the length of some edges. Additionally, the specified lower bound must correspond to the length of a particular root-leaf path. Through careful analysis of the problem's structural properties, we develop an algorithm with $O(n\log n)$ time complexity to solve (RIOVSPT$_{BH}$). Furthermore, by removing the path-length constraint, we derive the Minimum Cost Shortest Path Interdiction Problem on Trees (MCSPIT), for which we present an $O(n\log n)$ time algorithm that operates under weighted bottleneck Hamming distance. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of both algorithms.</description>
