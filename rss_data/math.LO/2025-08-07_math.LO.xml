      <title>Teasing apart definitional equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Enayat and Le lyk [2024] show that second order arithmetic and countable set theory are not definitionally equivalent. It is well known that these theories are biinterpretable. Thus, we have a pair of natural theories that llustrate a meaningful difference between definitional equivalence and bi-interpretability. This is particularly interesting given that Visser and Friedman [2014] have shown that a wide class of natural foundational theories in mathematics are such that if they are bi-interpretable, then they are also definitionally equivalent. The proof offered by Enayat and Le lyk makes use of an inaccessible cardinal. In this short note, we show that the failure of bi-interpretability can be established in Peano Arithmetic merely supposing that one of our target theories are consistent.</description>

      <title>On Shelah's Approachability Ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem of Shelah regarding the \emph{Approachability Ideal} $I[\kappa^+]$. Given a singular cardinal $\aleph_\gamma$, a regular cardinal $\mu\in (\mathrm{cf}(\gamma),\aleph_\gamma)$ and assuming appropriate large cardinal hypotheses, we construct a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which $\aleph_{\gamma+1} \cap \mathrm{cof}(\mu) \notin I[\aleph_{\gamma+1}]$. This provides a definitive answer to a question of Shelah from the 80's. In addition, assuming large cardinals, we construct a model of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ in which the approachability property fails, simultaneously, at every singular cardinal. This is a major milestone in the solution of a question of Foreman and Magidor from the 80's.</description>

      <title>Relating homotopy equivalences to conservativity in dependent type theories with computation axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, or computation axioms, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.</description>

      <title>Demystifying $\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01096v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the theory of illfounded and cyclic proofs for the propositional modal $\mu$-calculus. A fine analysis of provability for classical and intuitionistic modal logic provides a novel bridge between finitary, cyclic and illfounded conceptions of proof and re-enforces the importance of two normal form theorems for the logic: guardedness and disjunctiveness.</description>

      <title>Low$_2$ computably enumerable sets have hyperhypersimple supersets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A longstanding question is to characterize the lattice of supersets (modulo finite sets), $\mathcal{L}^*(A)$, of a low$_2$ computably enumerable (c.e.) set. The conjecture is that $\mathcal{L}^*(A)\cong {\mathcal E}^*$. In spite of claims in the literature, this longstanding question/conjecture remains open. We contribute to this problem by solving one of the main test cases. We show that if c.e.\ $A$ is low$_2$ then $A$ has an atomless hyperhypersimple superset. In fact, if $A$ is c.e.\ and low$_2$, then for any $\Sigma_3$-Boolean algebra~$B$ there is some c.e.\ $H\supseteq A$ such that $\mathcal{L}^*(H)\cong B$.</description>

      <title>Any function I can actually write down is measurable, right?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository paper aimed at a general mathematical audience, we discuss how to combine certain classic theorems of set-theoretic inner model theory and effective descriptive set theory with work on Hilbert's tenth problem and universal Diophantine equations to produce the following surprising result: There is a specific polynomial $p(x,y,z,n,k_1,\dots,k_{70})$ of degree $7$ with integer coefficients such that it is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ (and much stronger theories) whether the function $$f(x) = \inf_{y \in \mathbb{R}}\sup_{z \in \mathbb{R}}\inf_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\sup_{\bar{k} \in \mathbb{N}^{70}}p(x,y,z,n,\bar{k})$$ is Lebesgue measurable. We also give similarly defined $g(x,y)$ with the property that the statement "$x \mapsto g(x,r)$ is measurable for every $r \in \mathbb{R}$" has large cardinal consistency strength (and in particular implies the consistency of $\mathsf{ZFC}$) and $h(m,x,y,z)$ such that $h(1,x,y,z),\dots,h(16,x,y,z)$ can consistently be the indicator functions of a Banach$\unicode{x2013}$Tarski paradoxical decomposition of the sphere.
  Finally, we discuss some situations in which measurability of analogously defined functions can be concluded by inspection, which touches on model-theoretic o-minimality and the fact that sufficiently strong large cardinal hypotheses (such as Vop\v{e}nka's principle and much weaker assumptions) imply that all 'reasonably definable' functions (including the above $f(x)$, $g(x,y)$, and $h(m,x,y,z)$) are universally measurable.</description>

      <title>Definable ranks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the definable rank of an ordered field, ordered abelian group and ordered set, respectively. We study the relation between the definable rank of an ordered field and the definable rank of the value group of its natural valuation. Similarly we compare the definable rank of an ordered abelian group and the value set of its natural valuation. We consider in particular the case of an almost real closed field and give conditions under which the definable ranks on the level of field, of value group and of value set coincide.</description>

      <title>Dependent Types Simplified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two logical systems based on dependent types that are comparable to ZFC, both in terms of simplicity and having natural set theoretic interpretations. Our perspective is that of a mathematician trained in classical logic, but nevertheless we hope this paper might go some way to bridging the cultural divide between type theorists coming from computer science.</description>
