      <title>Low-Rank Estimation of Nonlinear Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates nonlinear panel regression models with interactive fixed effects and introduces a general framework for parameter estimation under potentially non-convex objective functions. We propose a computationally feasible two-step estimation procedure. In the first step, nuclear-norm regularization (NNR) is used to obtain preliminary estimators of the coefficients of interest, factors, and factor loadings. The second step involves an iterative procedure for post-NNR inference, improving the convergence rate of the coefficient estimator. We establish the asymptotic properties of both the preliminary and iterative estimators. We also study the determination of the number of factors. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in determining the number of factors and estimating the model parameters. In our empirical application, we apply the proposed approach to study the cross-market arbitrage behavior of U.S. nonfinancial firms.</description>

      <title>Beyond Parallel Trends: An Identification-Strategy-Robust Approach to Causal Inference with Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to causal inference with panel data. Instead of using panel data to adjust for differences in the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity between the treated and comparison groups, we instead use panel data to search for "close comparison groups" -- groups that are similar to the treated group in terms of pre-treatment outcomes. Then, we compare the outcomes of the treated group to the outcomes of these close comparison groups in post-treatment periods. We show that this approach is often identification-strategy-robust in the sense that our approach recovers the ATT under many different non-nested panel data identification strategies, including difference-in-differences, change-in-changes, or lagged outcome unconfoundedness, among several others. We provide related, though non-nested, results under "time homogeneity", where outcomes do not systematically change over time for any comparison group. Our strategy asks more out of the research design -- namely that there exist close comparison groups or time homogeneity (neither of which is required for most existing panel data approaches to causal inference) -- but, when available, leads to more credible inferences.</description>

      <title>Generalized method of moments with partially missing data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized method of moments framework in which a part of the data vector is missing for some units in a completely unrestricted, potentially endogenous way. In this setup, the parameters of interest are usually only partially identified. We characterize the identified set for such parameters using the support function of the convex set of moment predictions consistent with the data. This identified set is sharp, valid for both continuous and discrete data, and straightforward to estimate. We also propose a statistic for testing hypotheses and constructing confidence regions for the true parameter, show that standard nonparametric bootstrap may not be valid, and suggest a fix using the bootstrap for directionally differentiable functionals of Fang and Santos (2019). A set of Monte Carlo simulations demonstrates that both our estimator and the confidence region perform well when samples are moderately large and the data have bounded supports.</description>

      <title>Unobserved Heterogeneous Spillover Effects in Instrumental Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for identifying causal effects in settings with spillovers, where both outcomes and endogenous treatment decisions are influenced by peers within a known group. It introduces the generalized local average controlled spillover and direct effects (LACSEs and LACDEs), which extend the local average treatment effect framework to settings with spillovers and establish sufficient conditions for their point identification without restricting the cardinality of the support of instrumental variables. These conditions clarify the necessity of commonly imposed restrictions to achieve point identification with binary instruments in related studies. The paper then defines the marginal controlled spillover and direct effects (MCSEs and MCDEs), which naturally extend the marginal treatment effect framework to settings with spillovers and are nonparametrically point identified from continuous variation in instruments. These marginal effects serve as building blocks for a broad class of policy-relevant treatment effects, including some causal spillover parameters in the related literature. Semiparametric and parametric estimators are developed, and an application using Add Health data reveals heterogeneity in education spillovers within best-friend networks.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects in the Regression Discontinuity Model with Counterfactual Cutoff and Distorted Running Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for evaluating the total policy effect in regression discontinuity designs (RDD), incorporating both the direct effect of treatment on outcomes and the indirect effect arising from distortions in the running variable when treatment becomes available. Our identification strategy combines a conditional parallel trend assumption to recover untreated potential outcomes with a local invariance assumption that characterizes how the running variable responds to counterfactual policy cutoffs. These components allow us to identify and estimate counterfactual treatment effects for any proposed threshold. We construct a nonparametric estimator for the total effect, derive its asymptotic distribution, and propose bootstrap inference procedures. Finally, we apply our framework to the Italian Domestic Stability Pact, where population-based fiscal rules generate both behavioral responses and running-variable distortions.</description>

      <title>An empirical estimate of the electricity supply curve from market outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers and electricity sector practitioners frequently require the supply curve of electricity markets and the price elasticity of supply for purposes such as price forecasting, policy analyses or market power assessment. It is common practice to construct supply curves from engineering data such as installed capacity and fuel prices. In this study, we propose a data-driven methodology to estimate the supply curve of electricity market empirically, i.e. from observed prices and quantities without further modeling assumptions. Due to the massive swings in fuel prices during the European energy crisis, a central task is detecting periods of stable supply curves. To this end, we implement two alternative clustering methods, one based on the fundamental drivers of electricity supply and the other directly on observed market outcomes. We apply our methods to the German electricity market between 2019 and 2024. We find that both approaches identify almost identical regimes shifts, supporting the idea of stable supply regimes stemming from stable drivers. Supply conditions are often stable for extended periods, but evolved rapidly during the energy crisis, triggering a rapid succession of regimes. Fuel prices were the dominant drivers of regime shifts, while conventional plant availability and the nuclear phase-out play a comparatively minor role. Our approach produces empirical supply curves suitable for causal inference and counterfactual analysis of market outcomes.</description>

      <title>Transferable Utility Matching Beyond Logit: Computation and Estimation with General Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for matching with transferable utility (TU) that accommodates arbitrary heterogeneity without relying on the logit structure. The optimal assignment problem is characterized by tractable linear programming formulation, allowing flexible error distributions and correlation patterns. We introduce an iterative algorithm that solves large-scale assignment problems with guaranteed convergence and an intuitive economic interpretation, and we show how the same structure supports a simulated moment-matching estimator of the systematic surplus. Experiments using simulated data demonstrate the algorithm's scalability and the estimator's consistency under correct specification, as well as systematic bias arising from logit misspecification.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of the perturbed utility stochastic traffic equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a sensitivity analysis framework for the perturbed utility route choice (PURC) model and the accompanying stochastic traffic equilibrium model. We derive analytical sensitivity expressions for the Jacobian of the individual optimal PURC flow and equilibrium link flows with respect to link cost parameters under general assumptions. This allows us to determine the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network. We show how to implement these results while exploiting the sparsity generated by the PURC model. Numerical examples illustrate the use of our method for estimating equilibrium link flows after link cost shifts, identifying critical design parameters, and quantifying uncertainty in performance predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a large-scale example. The findings have implications for network design, pricing strategies, and policy analysis in transportation planning and economics, providing a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an econometric framework that adapts tools for scenario analysis, such as variants of conditional forecasts and generalized impulse responses, for use with dynamic nonparametric models. The proposed algorithms are based on predictive simulation and sequential Monte Carlo methods. Their utility is demonstrated with three applications: (1) conditional forecasts based on stress test scenarios, measuring (2) macroeconomic risk under varying financial stress, and estimating the (3) asymmetric effects of financial shocks in the US and their international spillovers. Our empirical results indicate the importance of nonlinearities and asymmetries in relationships between macroeconomic and financial variables.</description>

      <title>PLRD: Partially Linear Regression Discontinuity Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression discontinuity designs have become one of the most popular research designs in empirical economics. We argue, however, that widely used approaches to building confidence intervals in regression discontinuity designs exhibit suboptimal behavior in practice: In a simulation study calibrated to high-profile applications of regression discontinuity designs, existing methods either have systematic under-coverage or have wider-than-necessary intervals. We propose a new approach, partially linear regression discontinuity inference (PLRD), and find it to address shortcomings of existing methods: Throughout our experiments, confidence intervals built using PLRD are both valid and short. We also provide large-sample guarantees for PLRD under smoothness assumptions.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training Estimators for Structural Models: Application to Consumer Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00526v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop pre-trained estimators for structural econometric models. The estimator uses a neural net to recognize the structural model's parameter from data patterns. Once trained, the estimator can be shared and applied to different datasets at negligible cost and effort. Under sufficient training, the estimator converges to the Bayesian posterior given the data patterns. As an illustration, we construct a pretrained estimator for a sequential search model (available at pnnehome.github.io). Estimation takes only seconds and achieves high accuracy on 12 real datasets. More broadly, pretrained estimators can make structural models much easier to use and more accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I introduce heterogeneity into the analysis of peer effects that arise from conformity, allowing the strength of the taste for conformity to vary across agents' actions. Using a structural model based on a simultaneous network game with incomplete information, I derive conditions for equilibrium uniqueness and for the identification of heterogeneous peer-effect parameters. I also propose specification tests to determine whether the conformity model or the spillover model is consistent with the observed data in the presence of heterogeneous peer effects. Applying the model to data on smoking and alcohol consumption among secondary school students, I show that assuming a homogeneous preference for conformity leads to biased estimates.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Control Function Approach to Production Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the control function approach to production function estimation. Our generalization accommodates scenarios in which productivity evolves jointly with other unobservable factors such as latent demand shocks and the invertibility assumption underpinning the traditional proxy variable approach fails. We provide conditions under which the output elasticity of the variable input -- and hence the markup -- is nonparametrically point-identified. A Neyman orthogonal moment condition ensures oracle efficiency of our GMM estimator. A Monte Carlo exercise shows a large bias for the traditional proxy variable approach that decreases rapidly and nearly vanishes for our generalized control function approach.</description>

      <title>Big Wins, Small Net Gains: Direct and Spillover Effects of First Industry Entries in Puerto Rico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I study how first sizable industry entries reshape local and neighboring labor markets in Puerto Rico. Using over a decade of quarterly municipality--industry data (2014Q1--2025Q1), I identify ``first sizable entries'' as large, persistent jumps in establishments, covered employment, and wage bill, and treat these as shocks to local industry presence at the municipio--industry level. Methodologically, I combine staggered-adoption difference-in-differences estimators that are robust to heterogeneous treatment timing with an imputation-based event-study approach, and I use a doubly robust difference-in-differences framework that explicitly allows for interference through pre-specified exposure mappings on a contiguity graph. The estimates show large and persistent direct gains in covered employment and wage bill in the treated municipality--industry cells over 0--16 quarters. Same-industry neighbors experience sizable short-run gains that reverse over the medium run, while within-municipality cross-industry and neighbor all-industries spillovers are small and imprecisely estimated. Once these spillovers are taken into account and spatially robust inference and sensitivity checks are applied, the net regional 0--16 quarter effect on covered employment is positive but modest in magnitude and estimated with considerable uncertainty. The results imply that first sizable entries generate substantial local gains where they occur, but much smaller and less precisely measured net employment gains for the broader regional economy, highlighting the importance of accounting for spatial spillovers when evaluating place-based policies.</description>
