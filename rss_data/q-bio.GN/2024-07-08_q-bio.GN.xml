      <title>Metagenomic analysis revealed significant changes in cattle rectum microbiome and antimicrobial resistome under fescue toxicosis</title>

Abstract: Fescue toxicity causes reduced growth and reproductive issues in cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue. To characterize the gut microbiota and its response to fescue toxicosis, we collected fecal samples before and after a 30-days toxic fescue seeds supplementation from eight Angus Simmental pregnant cows and heifers. We sequenced the 16 metagenomes using the whole-genome shotgun approach and generated 157 Gbp of metagenomic sequences. Through de novo assembly and annotation, we obtained a 13.1 Gbp reference contig assembly and identified 22 million microbial genes for cattle rectum microbiota. We discovered a significant reduction of microbial diversity after toxic seed treatment (P&lt;0.01), suggesting dysbiosis of the microbiome. Six bacterial families and 31 species are significantly increased in the fecal microbiota (P-adj&lt;0.05), including members of the top abundant rumen core taxa. This global elevation of rumen microbes in the rectum microbiota suggests a potential impairment of rumen microbiota under fescue toxicosis. Among these, Ruminococcaceae bacterium P7, an important species accounting for ~2% of rumen microbiota, was the most impacted with a 16-fold increase from 0.17% to 2.8% in feces (P&lt;0.01). We hypothesized that rumen Ruminococcaceae bacterium P7 re-adapted to the large intestine environment under toxic fescue stress, causing this dramatic increase in abundance. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the overrepresented pathways shifted from energy metabolism to antimicrobial resistance and DNA replication. In conclusion, we discovered dramatic microbiota alterations in composition, abundance, and functional capacities under fescue toxicosis, and our results suggest Ruminococcaceae bacterium P7 as a potential biomarker for fescue toxicosis management.</description>

      <title>Metagenomic analysis reveals shared and distinguishing features in horse and donkey gut microbiome and maternal resemblance of the microbiota in hybrid equids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mammalian gut microbiomes are essential for host functions like digestion, immunity, and nutrient utilization. This study examines the gut microbiome of horses, donkeys, and their hybrids, mules and hinnies, to explore the role of microbiomes in hybrid vigor. We performed whole-genome sequencing on rectal microbiota from 18 equids, generating detailed microbiome assemblies. Our analysis revealed significant differences between horse and donkey microbiomes, with hybrids showing a pronounced maternal resemblance. Notably, Firmicutes were more abundant in the horse-maternal group, while Fibrobacteres were richer in the donkey-maternal group, indicating distinct digestive processes. Functional annotations indicated metabolic differences, such as protein synthesis in horses and energy metabolism in donkeys. Machine learning predictions of probiotic species highlighted potential health benefits for each maternal group. This study provides a high-resolution view of the equid gut microbiome, revealing significant taxonomic and metabolic differences influenced by maternal lineage, and offers insights into microbial contributions to hybrid vigor.</description>

      <title>Analysis of genetic diversity among some Iraqi durum wheat cultivars revealed by different molecular markers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Durum wheat has been cultivated since the beginning of crop domestication, occupying now the tenth ranking among the global most significant cultivated crops. Despite the fact that, the extent of the crop genetic diversity has not yet fully incorporated into modern varieties through breeding programs. In this study, a total of 35 markers (11 RAPD, 12 ISSR, and 12 CDDP) were utilized to assess the genetic variability and population structure of sixteen different cultivars of Iraqi durum wheat. Out of 294 bands obtained, 171 were identified as polymorphic: 47.00 polymorphic alleles from 98 RAPD bands, 53 polymorphic alleles from a total of 89 ISSR bands, and 71 alleles from 107 CDDP bands. The average number of observed alleles (Na), effective number of alleles (Ne), Shannon's information index (I), expected heterozygosity or gene diversity (He), unbiased expected heterozygosity (uHe), and polymorphic information content (PIC) (1.45, 1.38, 0.32, 0.22, 0.24, and 0.28, respectively) were obtained for RAPDs , (1.63, 1.45, 0.40, 0.27, 0.29, and 0.32, respectively) ISSRs and (1.35, 1.35, 0.31, 0.21, 0.23, and 0.30, respectively) for the CDDP markers. A dendrogram of two main clades (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean; UPGMA) and three populations of structure analysis, were obtained based on the three markers data. The analysis of molecular variance indicated 97.00%, 97.00%, and 90.00% variability within populations, applying RAPD, ISSR, and CDDP markers, respectively. The highest diversity indices were revealed in population 2 under the RAPD and CDDP markers, whereas population 1 had the highest values of these indices according to the ISSR markers. The results provide greater knowledge on the genetic makeup of Iraqi durum wheat cultivars, that facilitate future breeding programs of this crop.</description>
