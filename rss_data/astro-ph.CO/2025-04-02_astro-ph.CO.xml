      <title>Advancing Cosmological Parameter Estimation and Hubble Parameter Reconstruction with Long Short-Term Memory and Efficient-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for cosmological parameter estimation and Hubble parameter reconstruction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Efficient-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (Ef-KAN). LSTM networks are employed to extract features from observational data, enabling accurate parameter inference and posterior distribution estimation without relying on solvable likelihood functions. This method achieves performance comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, offering a computationally efficient alternative for high-dimensional parameter spaces. By sampling from the reconstructed data and comparing it with mock data, our designed LSTM constraint procedure demonstrates the superior performance of this method in terms of constraint accuracy, and effectively captures the degeneracies and correlations between the cosmological parameters. Additionally, the Ef-KAN model is introduced to reconstruct the Hubble parameter H(z) from both observational and mock data. Ef-KAN is entirely data-driven approach, free from prior assumptions, and demonstrates superior capability in modeling complex, non-linear data distributions. We validate the Ef-KAN method by reconstructing the Hubble parameter, demonstrating that H(z) can be reconstructed with high accuracy. By combining LSTM and Ef-KAN, we provide a robust framework for cosmological parameter inference and Hubble parameter reconstruction, paving the way for future research in cosmology, especially when dealing with complex datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>Meta-learning for cosmological emulation: Rapid adaptation to new lensing kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical computation of cosmological observables is an intensive process, restricting the speed at which cosmological data can be analysed and cosmological models constrained, and therefore limiting research access to those with high performance computing infrastructure. Whilst the use of machine learning to emulate these computations has been studied, most existing emulators are specialised and not suitable for emulating a wide range of observables with changing physical models. Here, we investigate the Model-adaptive Meta-Learning algorithm (MAML) for training a cosmological emulator. MAML attempts to train a set of network parameters for rapid fine-tuning to new tasks within some distribution of tasks. Specifically, we consider a simple case where the galaxy sample changes, resulting in a different redshift distribution and lensing kernel. Using MAML, we train a cosmic-shear angular power spectrum emulator for rapid adaptation to new redshift distributions with only $O(100)$ fine-tuning samples, whilst not requiring any parametrisation of the redshift distributions. We compare the performance of the MAML emulator to two standard emulators, one pre-trained on a single redshift distribution and the other with no pre-training, both in terms of accuracy on test data, and the constraints produced when using the emulators for cosmological inference. We observe that within an MCMC analysis, the MAML emulator is able to better reproduce the fully-theoretical posterior, achieving a Battacharrya distance from the fully-theoretical posterior in the $S_8$ -- $\Omega_m$ plane of 0.008, compared to 0.038 from the single-task pre-trained emulator and 0.243 for the emulator with no pre-training.</description>

      <title>Cosmography with the Double Source Plane Strong Gravitational Lens AGEL150745+052256</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses with two background sources at widely separated redshifts are a powerful and independent probe of cosmological parameters. We can use these systems, known as Double-Source-Plane Lenses (DSPLs), to measure the ratio ($\beta$) of angular-diameter distances of the sources, which is sensitive to the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the equation-of-state parameter for dark-energy ($w$). However, DSPLs are rare and require high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for detection, lens modeling, and measuring $\beta$. Here we report only the second DSPL ever used to measure cosmological parameters. We model the DSPL AGEL150745+052256 from the ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses (AGEL) survey using HST/WFC3 imaging and Keck/KCWI spectroscopy. The spectroscopic redshifts for the deflector and two sources in AGEL1507 are $z_{\rm defl}=0.594$, $z_{\rm S1}=2.163$, and $z_{\rm S2}=2.591$. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm obs}=109 \pm 27$ km s$^{-1}$ for the nearer source. Using $\sigma_{\rm obs}$ for the main deflector (from literature) and S1, we test the robustness of our DSPL model. We measure $\beta=0.953^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ for AGEL1507 and infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.33^{+0.38}_{-0.23}$ for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Combining AGEL1507 with the published model of the Jackpot lens improves the precision on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ ($\Lambda$CDM) and w (wCDM) by $\sim 10 \%$. The inclusion of DSPLs significantly improves the constraints when combined with Plancks cosmic microwave background observations, enhancing precision on w by $30 \%$. This paper demonstrates the constraining power of DSPLs and their complementarity to other standard cosmological probes. Tighter future constraints from larger DSPL samples discovered from ongoing and forthcoming large-area sky surveys would provide insights into the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>One-parameter dynamical dark energy: Hints for oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence from multiple cosmological probes that dark energy may be dynamical, with an equation of state that evolves over cosmic time. While this evidence is typically quantified using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, based on a linear expansion of $w(a)$ in the scale factor, non-parametric reconstructions frequently suggest non-linear features, particularly at late times. In this work, we investigate four minimal one-parameter models of dark energy with non-linear dependence on the scale factor. These models are constrained using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck, lensing reconstruction from ACT-DR6, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI-DR2, and three Type-Ia supernovae (SNe) samples (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), considered independently. Although our conclusions depend on the choice of SNe sample, we consistently find a preference, as measured by the chi-squared statistic and the Bayesian evidence, for these dynamical dark energy models over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Notably, with the PantheonPlus dataset, one model shows strong Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln B \simeq 4.5$) against CPL, favoring an equation of state that peaks near $a \simeq 0.7$ and oscillates near the present day. These results highlight the impact of SNe selection and contribute to the growing collection of evidence for late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from Planck PR4 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first bispectrum analysis of the final Planck release temperature and E-polarization CMB data, called PR4. We use the binned bispectrum estimator pipeline that was also used for the previous Planck releases as well as the integrated bispectrum estimator. We test the standard primordial (local, equilateral and orthogonal) and secondary (lensing, unclustered point sources and CIB) bispectrum shapes. The final primordial results of the full T+E analysis are $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{local} = -0.1 \pm 5.0$, $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{equil} = 6 \pm 46$ and $f_\mathrm{NL}^\mathrm{ortho} = -8 \pm 21$. These results are consistent with previous Planck releases, but have slightly smaller error bars than in PR3, up to $12\%$ smaller for orthogonal. They represent the best Planck constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity. The lensing and point source bispectra are also detected, consistent with PR3. We perform several validation tests and find in particular that the 600 simulations, used to determine the linear correction term and the error bars, have a systematically low lensing bispectrum. We show however that this has no impact on our results.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic isotropy: Hubble constant and matter density large-angle variations with the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigate potential large-angle anisotropies in the angular distribution of the cosmological parameters $H_0$ (the Hubble constant) and $\Omega_m$ (the matter density) in the flat-$\Lambda$CDM framework, using the Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae catalog. For this we perform a directional analysis by dividing the celestial sphere into a set of directions, and estimate the best-fit cosmological parameters across the sky using a MCMC approach. Our results show a dominant dipolar pattern for both parameters in study, suggesting a preferred axis in the universe expansion and in the distribution of matter. However, we also found that for $z \gtrsim 0.015$, this dipolar behavior is not statistically significant, confirming the expectation -- in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario -- of an isotropic expansion and a uniform angular distribution of matter (both results at $1\,\sigma$ confidence level). Nevertheless, for nearby supernovae, at distances $\lesssim 60$ Mpc or $z \lesssim 0.015$, the peculiar velocities introduce a highly significant dipole in the angular distribution of $H_0$. Furthermore, we perform various robustness tests that support our findings, and consistency tests of our methodology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Implies a Coupled Dark Sector: Insights from DESI DR2 via a Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) have revealed compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy, challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we adopt a data-driven, model-independent approach to reconstruct the dark energy equation of state (EoS) and its potential interaction with dark matter using combined background cosmological datasets, including DESI DR2, cosmic chronometers, observational Hubble data, and Type Ia supernovae. Using Gaussian Process regression and a non-parametric formalism, we first confirm a $\sim 2\sigma$ indication of dynamical dark energy, featuring a phantom crossing around redshift $z \sim 0.4$, consistent with DESI results. We then explore the implications of dynamical EoS from DESI DR2 for dark sector coupling. Incorporating priors on the EoS from DESI DR2, we find a $2.2\sigma$ signal for non-zero interactions between dark energy and dark matter at low redshift. Our results suggest that if DESI's evidence for time-varying dark energy is confirmed, a coupled dark sector may be a necessary extension beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark energy after DESI DR2: a challenge for $\Lambda$CDM paradigm?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scenario of interacting dark energy through a detailed confrontation with various observational datasets. We quantify the interaction in a general way, through the deviation from the standard scaling of the dark matter energy density. We use observational Hubble Data from Cosmic Chronometers (CC), data from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the recently released DESI DR2, data from Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), both with and without calibration by SH0ES, and finally the CMB data from Planck 2018. For the basic and simplest interacting model, we find that the data favor a non-zero interaction up to $2\sigma$. Notably, when we employ SH0ES-calibrated SNIa data the preference of non-zero interaction becomes more significant. However, comparison with $\Lambda$CDM scenario through AIC, BIC and Bayesian analysis, reveals a mixed picture.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Theory in the Precision Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document summarises discussions on future directions in theoretical neutrino physics, which are the outcome of a neutrino theory workshop held at CERN in February 2025. The starting point is the realisation that neutrino physics offers unique opportunities to address some of the most fundamental questions in physics. This motivates a vigorous experimental programme which the theory community fully supports. \textbf{A strong effort in theoretical neutrino physics is paramount to optimally take advantage of upcoming neutrino experiments and to explore the synergies with other areas of particle, astroparticle, and nuclear physics, as well as cosmology.} Progress on the theory side has the potential to significantly boost the physics reach of experiments, as well as go well beyond their original scope. Strong collaboration between theory and experiment is essential in the precision era. To foster such collaboration, \textbf{we propose to establish a CERN Neutrino Physics Centre.} Taking inspiration from the highly successful LHC Physics Center at Fermilab, the CERN Neutrino Physics Centre would be the European hub of the neutrino community, covering experimental and theoretical activities.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Lensed Quasar Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lensed quasars are key to many areas of study in astronomy, offering a unique probe into the intermediate and far universe. However, finding lensed quasars has proved difficult despite significant efforts from large collaborations. These challenges have limited catalogues of confirmed lensed quasars to the hundreds, despite theoretical predictions that they should be many times more numerous. We train machine learning classifiers to discover lensed quasar candidates. By using semi-supervised learning techniques we leverage the large number of potential candidates as unlabelled training data alongside the small number of known objects, greatly improving model performance. We present our two most successful models: (1) a variational autoencoder trained on millions of quasars to reduce the dimensionality of images for input to a gradient boosting classifier that can make accurate predictions and (2) a convolutional neural network trained on a mix of labelled and unlabelled data via virtual adversarial training. These models are both capable of producing high-quality candidates, as evidenced by our discovery of GRALJ140833.73+042229.98. The success of our classifier, which uses only images, is particularly exciting as it can be combined with existing classifiers, which use other data than images, to improve the classifications of both models and discover more lensed quasars.</description>

      <title>Massive Black Holes Seeded by Dark Matter -- Implications for Little Red Dots and Gravitational Wave Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts challenge standard seeding scenarios. We examine a dissipative self-interacting dark matter (dSIDM) model in which gravothermal collapse leads to the formation of massive BH seeds ab initio. We utilize a semi-analytical framework to predict properties of the dSIDM-seeded SMBH population. Billion solar mass quasars are reproduced along with low-mass faint active galactic nuclei (known as little red dots) with SMBH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratios consistent with recent James Webb Space Telescope observations. To match the abundance of the observed bright quasars, a percent-level duty-cycle is suggested, implying a large population of dormant SMBHs. The gravitational wave (GW) signals from mergers of these massive SMBHs can be detected by LISA while remaining within the NANOGrav constraints on the GW background. These results provide testable signatures of DM-driven SMBH formation, offering a pathway to probe hidden-sector physics through SMBH and GW observables.</description>

      <title>Axion forces in axion backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of the pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at the tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced when there exists an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible probes on this using fifth-force search and atomic spectroscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the B-L gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during B-L symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Non-Thermal Pressure at galaxy cluster outskirts from a Joint SPT and XMM-Newton Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present joint South Pole Telescope (SPT) and XMM-Newton observations of 8 massive galaxy clusters (0.8--1.7$\times$10$^{15}$ M$_{\odot}$) spanning a redshift range of 0.16 to 0.35. Employing a novel SZ+X-ray fitting technique, we effectively constrain the thermodynamic properties of these clusters out to the virial radius. The resulting best-fit electron density, deprojected temperature, and deprojected pressure profiles are in good agreement with previous observations of massive clusters. For the majority of the cluster sample (5 out of 8 clusters), the entropy profiles exhibit a self-similar behavior near the virial radius. We further derive hydrostatic mass, gas mass, and gas fraction profiles for all clusters up to the virial radius. Comparing the enclosed gas fraction profiles with the universal gas fraction profile, we obtain non-thermal pressure fraction profiles for our cluster sample at $&gt;$$R_{500}$, demonstrating a steeper increase between $R_{500}$ and $R_{200}$ that is consistent with the hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis yields non-thermal pressure fraction ranges of 8--28% (median: 15 $\pm$ 11%) at $R_{500}$ and 21--35% (median: 27 $\pm$ 12%) at $R_{200}$. Notably, weak-lensing mass measurements are available for only four clusters in our sample, and our recovered total cluster masses, after accounting for non-thermal pressure, are consistent with these measurements.</description>

      <title>An Updated Repository of Sub-mJy Extragalactic Source-Count Measurements in the Radio Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated repository of sub-mJy extragalactic radio source counts between $150$ MHz and $10$ GHz, incorporating recent advances in radio surveys and observational techniques. By compiling and refining previous datasets, we provide a comprehensive catalog that enhances the understanding of faint radio-source populations, including Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) and Radio-Quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (RQAGNs), from intermediate to high redshifts. Our analysis accounts for observational biases, such as resolution effects and Eddington bias, ensuring improved accuracy in flux-density estimations. We also discuss the implications of new-generation radio telescopes, such as the Square-Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) and its precursors and pathfinders, to further resolve these populations. Our collection contributes to constraining evolutionary models of radio sources, highlighting the increasing role of polarization studies in distinguishing different classes. This work serves as a key reference for future deep radio surveys targeting the faintest end of the extragalactic radio sky.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study general properties of confinement phase transitions in the early universe. An observable gravitational wave signal from such transitions requires significant supercooling. However, in almost all understood examples of confining gauge theories the degree of supercooling is too small to give interesting gravitational wave signals. We review and highlight the evidence why supercooling is not generic in confining gauge theories. The exceptions are Randall-Sundrum models which define a strongly coupled gauge theory holographically by a 5D gravitational theory. We construct a simple illustrative model of a 4D gauge theory inspired by features of the Randall-Sundrum model. It is a large-$N$ gauge theory in the conformal window coupled to a weakly coupled scalar field which undergoes a supercooled phase transition that breaks the conformal symmetry and triggers confinement. We show that there are interesting features in the gravitational wave spectra that can carry the imprint of the confining gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Origin of bulk viscosity in cosmology and its thermodynamic implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is two folded: (1) we propose a new mechanism for the origin of bulk viscosity in cosmological context, and then, (2) we address the thermodynamic implications of viscous cosmology based on the thermodynamics of apparent horizon. In particular, we show that the velocity gradient of the comoving expansion of the universe (along the distance measured from a comoving observer) in turn leads to a viscous like pressure of the fluid inside the apparent horizon. This points the importance of the bulk viscosity of fluid during the cosmological evolution of the universe, as the comoving expansion itself generates the viscosity. Therefore the thermodynamic interpretations of viscous cosmology becomes important from its own right. In this regard, it turns out that the cosmological evolution of the universe with a bulk viscosity $naturally$ satisfies the first and the second laws of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon, without imposing any exotic condition and for a general form of the coefficient of viscosity. This in turn affirms the thermodynamic correspondence of viscous cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Axion dark matter coupled via QCD induces a non-zero differential acceleration between test masses of different composition. Tests of the equivalence principle, like the recent MICROSCOPE space mission, are sensitive to such a signal. We use the final released data of the MICROSCOPE experiment, to search for this effect. We find no positive signal consistent with the dark matter model, and set upper limits on the axion-gluon coupling that improve existing laboratory bounds by up to two orders of magnitude for axion masses in the $10^{-17}$ eV to $10^{-13}$ eV range.</description>

      <title>Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the FRB Population Observed Through Galaxy Cluster Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High redshift Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are expected to be extremely powerful probes of our Universe. However, while a significant number of FRBs are expected to exist at high redshift, detecting them has been difficult, with only a handful robustly confirmed at redshifts greater than one. In many other fields, gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters has enabled high redshift detections by magnifying background sources. In this work we forecast the populations of FRBs expected to be detected by CHIME and upcoming instrument CHORD, for blank fields and by lensing through a range of strong lensing galaxy clusters, based on existing, observationally driven cluster models. We find that the presence of a galaxy cluster of mass $M\geq5\times10^{14} M_\odot$ within the detection beam of a transit telescope will approximately double the rate of detected high redshift ($z\geq1$ CHIME, $z\geq2$ CHORD) FRBs for that beam. Consequently, we find that knowledge of cluster positions can be used by instruments like CHIME or CHORD in tandem with novel observational strategies to isolate a sample of high redshift FRBs with $\gtrsim50\%$ purity at rate of $\lesssim3$ per year. This would provide a statistically high redshift sample of mostly gravitationally lensed FRBs, that would be ideal candidates for optical follow-up, constraining the FRB-star formation relation and for use in cosmological studies including measuring $H_0$, characterising dark matter substructures and probing reionization.</description>

      <title>Topological Electroweak Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we shall consider the effects of a non-trivial topology on the effective potential of the Standard Model. Specifically we shall assume that the spacetime topology is $S^1\times R^3$ and we shall calculate the Standard Model effective potential for such a topological spacetime. As we demonstrate, for small values of the compact dimension radius, the electroweak symmetry is unbroken, but for a critical length and beyond, the electroweak symmetry is broken, since the configuration space of the Higgs field contains an additional energetically favorable minimum, compared to the minimum at the origin. The two minima are separated by a barrier, thus a phase transition can occur, via quantum tunnelling, which mimics a first order phase transition. This is a non-thermal phase transition, similar possibly to quantum Hall topological phase transitions, hence in the context of this scenario, the electroweak symmetry breaking does not require a high temperature to occur. The present scenario does not rely on the occurrence of the inflationary era, only on the expansion of the Universe, however we briefly discuss the freezing of the superhorizon terms in $S^1\times R^3$ spacetime, if inflation occurred. We also investigate the large scale differences of the gravitational potential due to the non-trivial topology. Finally, we briefly mention the distinct inequivalent topological field configurations that can exist due to the non-trivial topology, which are classified by the first Stieffel class which in the case at hand is $H^{1}(S^{1}{\times R}^{3},Z_{\widetilde{2}})=Z_2$, so even and odd elements can exist. We also briefly qualitatively discuss how a topologically induced electroweak phase transition can yield primordial gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GWs due to the density fluctuation in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the single-field model, the preheating process occurs through self-resonance of inflaton field. We study the nonlinear structures generated during preheating in the $\alpha$-attractor models and monodromy models. The potentials have a power law form $\propto\left|\phi\right|^{2n}$ near the origin and a flat region away from bottom, which are consistent with current cosmological observations. The Floquet analysis shows that potential parameters in monodromy model have a significant influence on the region of resonance bands. Besides we investigate the formation of nonlinear structures, the equation of state and the energy transfer through the (3+1) dimensional lattice simulation. We find that all the models exhibit similar nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the inflation model at small field values, which is governed by the parameter $n$, exerts a more substantial influence on the nonlinear dynamics. The behavior at large field values, controlled by the parameter $q$, has a negligible impact.</description>

Abstract: By introducing the small noise expansion techniques, we show that the fully nonlinear (non-Markovian) stochastic inflationary system, may be re-cast in terms of an infinite set of Wiener processes (stochastic equations with white noises). As a byproduct, we show that the Starobinsky test field approximation might only provide information about the linear regime of cosmological perturbations and scalar-feld non-Gaussianities might only appear at leading order in slow-roll parameters.</description>

      <title>The Born approximation in wave optics gravitational lensing revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information about lensed gravitational waves is encapsulated by an amplification factor, which is calculated by an integration of an oscillatory function. The Born approximation, which has been studied in terms of wave optics in gravitational lensing, may provide a means of overcoming the difficulty in evaluating the oscillating function and better understanding the connection between the amplification factor and the lens mass distribution. In this paper, we revisit the Born approximation for a single lens plane. We find that the distortion of gravitational waves induced by wave optics gravitational lensing is in general connected with the mass distribution of the lens object through a convolution integral, where the scale of the kernel is determined by the Fresnel scale. We then study the validity and accuracy of the Born approximation specifically for the case of a point mass lens for which the exact analytical expression of the amplification factor is available. Using the dimensionless parameter $y$, which represents the normalized impact parameter, and the dimensionless parameter $w$, which denotes the normalized frequency, we show that the $n$-th term of the Born approximation scales as $y^{-2}w^{n-1}$. This indicates that, for the case of a point mass lens, the Born approximation is valid when $w$ is less than 1, with its accuracy scaling as $wy^{-2}$ in this regime.</description>

      <title>General Constraints on Isocurvature from the CMB and Ly-$\alpha$ Forest</title>

Abstract: Current cosmological data are well-described by the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which assumes adiabatic initial conditions for the primordial density perturbations. This agreement between data and theory enables strong constraints on new physics that generates isocurvature perturbations. Existing constraints typically assume a simple power law form for the isocurvature power spectrum. However, many new physics scenarios -- such as cosmological phase transitions and gravitational particle production -- can deviate from this assumption. To derive general constraints which apply to a wide variety of new physics scenarios, we consider four types of isocurvature modes (dark matter, baryon, dark radiation and neutrino density isocurvature) and parametrize the isocurvature power spectrum using two general forms: a delta function and a broken power law. Using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, and CMB spectral distortions, we place constraints on the isocurvature power spectrum across a wide range of scales, from $10^{-4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to $10^{4}\,\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: The increasing precision of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations has unveiled significant tensions between different datasets, notably between Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), as well as with the late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant. In this work, we explore a variety of $\Lambda$CDM extensions to assess their ability to reconcile these discrepancies. The statistical preference for these extensions remains moderate, and imposing $n_s=1$ often worsens model performance. Our findings highlight the limitations of incremental modifications to $\Lambda$CDM and suggest that either more complex new physics or, more likely, improved systematic understanding in the CMB sector may be required to fully address the observed tensions. While CMB experiments are often considered the gold standard of precision cosmology, our results reinforce that these measurements are not immune to systematic uncertainties, which may be underestimated in current analyses.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dark sector from a Mimetic-Metric-Torsion perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.12429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the basic theory of mimetic gravity by extending its purview to the general metric-compatible geometries that admit torsion, in addition to curvature. This essentially implies reinstating the mimetic principle of isolating the conformal degree of freedom of gravity in presence of torsion, by parametrizing both the physical metric and torsion in terms of the scalar `mimetic' field and the metric and torsion of a fiducial space. We assert the requisite torsion parametrization from an inspection of the fiducial space Cartan transformation which, together with the conformal transformation of the fiducial metric, preserve the physical metric and torsion. In formulating the scalar-tensor equivalent Lagrangian, we consider an explicit contact coupling of the mimetic field with torsion, so that the former can manifest itself geometrically as the source of a torsion mode, and most importantly, give rise to a viable `dark universe' picture from a mimicry of an evolving dust-like cosmological fluid with a non-zero pressure. A further consideration of higher derivatives of the mimetic field in the Lagrangian leads to physical bounds on the mimetic-torsion coupling strength, which we determine explicitly.</description>

      <title>Mimetic-Metric-Torsion with induced Axial mode and Phantom barrier crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.04906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the basic formalism of mimetic-metric-torsion gravity theory, in a way that the mimetic scalar field can manifest itself geometrically as the source of not only the trace mode of torsion, but also its axial (or, pseudo-trace) mode. Specifically, we consider the mimetic field to be (i) coupled explicitly to the well-known Holst extension of the Riemann-Cartan action, and (ii) identified with the square of the associated Barbero-Immirzi field, which is presumed to be a pseudo-scalar. The conformal symmetry originally prevalent in the theory would still hold, as the associated Cartan transformations do not affect the torsion pseudo-trace, and hence the Holst term. Demanding the theory to preserve the spatial parity symmetry as well, we focus on a geometric unification of the cosmological dark sector, and show that a super-accelerating regime in the course of evolution of the universe is always feasible. From the observational perspective, assuming the cosmological evolution profile to be very close to that for $\L$CDM, we further show that there could be a smooth crossing of the so-called phantom barrier at a low red-shift, however for a very restricted parametric domain. The extent of the super-acceleration have subsequently been ascertained by examining the evolution of the relevant torsion parameters.</description>

      <title>ALP Dark Matter from Kinetic Fragmentation: Opening up the Parameter Window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main mechanism responsible for Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) production in the early universe is the so-called misalignment mechanism. Three regimes have been investigated in this context: standard misalignment, large misalignment and kinetic misalignment. The latter applies if the axion inherits a large initial velocity in the early universe, such that the field rolls through many wiggles during its evolution, before it gets trapped in one minimum. This largely opens the region of parameter space for ALP dark matter towards higher values for the axion-photon coupling, which can be probed by the whole set of next decade's upcoming experiments. In fact, almost the entire parameter space in the [mass, decay constant] plane can now accommodate dark matter. In this paper, we show that in kinetic misalignment, the axion field is almost always entirely fragmented, meaning that the energy density of the homogeneous field is redistributed over higher-mode axions. We present a general model-independent analytical description of kinetic fragmentation, including discussion of the modified initial conditions for the mode functions due to the axion's initial velocity, and how they impact the growth of the adiabatic fluctuations. We calculate precisely the parameter regions corresponding respectively to standard misalignment, kinetic misalignment with weak fragmentation, fragmentation after trapping and fragmentation before trapping. While axion fragmentation can impact the precise determination of the relic abundance, another main observational implication is the formation of much denser compact axion halos, that is described in a companion paper. We also point out a new gravitational-wave signature that arises in the large misalignment regime with complete fragmentation and could be seen in measurements of $\mu$ distortions in the Cosmic Microwave Background.</description>

      <title>Ultralight scalar dark matter versus nonadiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence for stochastic gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations might open a new window for studying cosmology and astrophysical phenomena. In addition to signals from gravitational waves, there is motivation to explore residual signals from oscillating dark matter, which might partially comprise the galactic halo. We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can induce the Newtonian potential and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing. We show distinctive signatures in pulsar timing residuals and angular correlations in the PTA frequency band and considering the known distances of pulsars. For scalar dark matter, both the timing residuals and the angular correlation are sensitive to small variations in the distance, $\delta L$, due to the subleading-order correction of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$. In contrast, for perfect fluid dark matter, it is insensitive to the $\delta L$. For deterministic sources from scalar dark matter, the distance of a pulsar has influence on the degree of directional dependence of timing residuals, significantly. For stochastic sources from perfect fluid dark matter, the angular correlation tends to a constant and enhances only when the pulsar pair is very close to each other. In this sense, perfect fluid dark matter is shown to be a more suitable physical origin for monopolar signals in angular correlations compared to the scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal production of heavy vector dark matter from relativistic bubble walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy vector boson dark matter at the TeV scale or higher may be produced non-thermally in a first-order phase transition taking place at a lower energy scale. While the production of vector dark matter has previously been studied for bubble wall collisions, here we calculate production by bubble wall expansion in a plasma, which can be the dominant production mechanism. We compute the results numerically and provide an analytical fit for the vector dark matter density. The numerical fit is also validated for scalar dark matter production, obtaining results in agreement with past literature. We find that vector pair production leads to bubble wall friction with a novel boost factor scaling behaviour compared to transition radiation emission of a single vector. We conclude that TeV-scale WIMP vector dark matter can be efficiently produced non-thermally by first-order phase transitions in a wide region of parameter space where thermal freeze-out is inefficient. In this scenario, the phase transition scale is predicted to be in the sub-GeV to $\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV range and could therefore be accessible to future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Assembly and Evolution in the P-Millennium simulation: galaxy clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [abridged] We present results from the latest version of the GAEA theoretical model of galaxy formation coupled with merger trees extracted from the Planck Millennium Simulation (PMS). With respect to the Millennium Simulation, the PMS provides a better mass resolution, a larger volume and assumes cosmological parameters consistent with latest results from the Planck mission. The model includes a treatment for the partition of cold gas into atomic and molecular (H$_2$) components; a better treatment for environmental processes; an updated modelling of cold gas accretion on Super-Massive Black Holes. We compare GAEA predictions based on the PMS, with model realizations based on other simulations in the Millennium Suite, showing that the new model provides a remarkable consistency for most statistical properties of galaxy populations. We interpret this as due to the interplay between AGN feedback and H$_2$-based SFR, as model versions considering only one of the two mechanisms do not show the same level of consistency. We then compare model predictions with available data for the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2pCF) in the redshift range 0&lt;z$\lesssim$3. We show that GAEA runs correctly recover the main dependencies of the 2pCF as a function of stellar mass, star formation activity, HI-content and redshift for galaxies more massive than 10$^{9}$ M$_\odot$. These results suggest that our model correctly captures both the distribution of galaxy populations in the Large Scale Structure and the interplay between the main physical processes regulating their baryonic content, both for central and satellite galaxies. The model predicts a small redshift evolution of the clustering amplitude, that results in an overprediction of z$\sim$3 clustering strength with respect to the available estimates, but is still consistent with data within 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Partially Ionized Gas at Equilibrium Powered by Ultraviolet Irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of a partially ionized zone behind the usual H II zone in photo-ionized gas for gas density intermediate between ordinary H II regions and AGN BLRs and without X-rays. While Lyman continuum photons are depleted before reaching this zone, Balmer continuum photons can ionize the $n=2$ hydrogen atoms as those are pumped by scattering-trapped Ly$\alpha$ photons. Ly$\alpha$ photons need to be replenished in a steady state, but fast radiative cooling at high gas temperature makes replenishment through electron collisional excitation of $n=2$ inefficient. Independently of the temperature, Raman scattering of incident continuum photons on the Lyman-series damping wings injects Ly$\alpha$ photons in the line core and pumps the $n=2$ state, which helps realize a partially ionized equilibrium at $5000$--$7000\,$K. Since the ratio between the incident radiation flux and gas density is limited by the dynamic effects of radiation pressure, significant ionization fraction is only realized at densities $n_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$. A large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line ratio results from such partially ionized gas as large Balmer line optical depths enhance the $n=3$ population relative to higher $n$ states. Partial ionization also provides the ideal condition for internally forming an intense and very broad Ly$\alpha$ line, which can power strong fluorescent metal emission lines observed from the Weigelt blobs of $\eta$ Carinae in the Galaxy, and from a candidate young super star cluster in the Cosmic Noon Sunburst galaxy. This phenomenon may also have implications for understanding the spectra of high-$z$ galaxies that show unusually dense ionized gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the CMB. This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB. After providing analytic estimates of the transmission functions, we show that the covariance matrix in frequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic estimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both a perfect experiment, and for a realistic pulsar noise model. For a perfect experiment, we show that the SNR grows with the observation time and the number of frequency bins, in turn determined by the cadence of observation. For an imperfect experiment, the behaviour is similar, with an effective multipole-dependent number of frequency, obtained after weighting with noise. We predict that with $\sim 200$ pulsars monitored for $25$ years, multipoles of the HD correlation up to $\ell=4$ can be measured. Our findings clarify that is called \emph{cosmic variance} in previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, with optimal estimators, it can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation. We also discuss the case in which the graviton distribution function is anisotropic.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.</description>
