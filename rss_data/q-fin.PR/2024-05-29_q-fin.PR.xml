      <title>Risk-Neutral Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a functional generative approach to extract risk-neutral densities from market prices of options. Specifically, we model the log-returns on the time-to-maturity continuum as a stochastic curve driven by standard normal. We then use neural nets to represent the term structures of the location, the scale, and the higher-order moments, and impose stringent conditions on the learning process to ensure the neural net-based curve representation is free of static arbitrage. This specification is structurally clear in that it separates the modeling of randomness from the modeling of the term structures of the parameters. It is data adaptive in that we use neural nets to represent the shape of the stochastic curve. It is also generative in that the functional form of the stochastic curve, although parameterized by neural nets, is an explicit and deterministic function of the standard normal. This explicitness allows for the efficient generation of samples to price options across strikes and maturities, without compromising data adaptability. We have validated the effectiveness of this approach by benchmarking it against a comprehensive set of baseline models. Experiments show that the extracted risk-neutral densities accommodate a diverse range of shapes. Its accuracy significantly outperforms the extensive set of baseline models--including three parametric models and nine stochastic process models--in terms of accuracy and stability. The success of this approach is attributed to its capacity to offer flexible term structures for risk-neutral skewness and kurtosis.</description>

      <title>Approximating Smiles: A Time Change Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03776v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new method for approximating the shape of implied volatility smiles. The method is applicable to common semimartingale models, such as jump-diffusion, rough volatility, and infinite activity models. We firstly adopt an Edgeworth expansion method to approximate the at-the-money skew and curvature and propose conditions under which the approximation errors converge. Then, we explicitly approximate the volatility skew and curvature under a time change framework using moment-based formula. Additionally, we derive the characteristics of volatility skew and curvature and explain their implications for model selection based on the approximation. The accuracy of the short-term approximation results on models is tested via numerical methods and on empirical data. The method is then applied to the calibration problem.</description>

      <title>Automated Market Making and Loss-Versus-Rebalancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06046v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the market microstructure of automated market makers (AMMs) from the perspective of liquidity providers (LPs). Our central contribution is a ``Black-Scholes formula for AMMs''. We identify the main adverse selection cost incurred by LPs, which we call ``loss-versus-rebalancing'' (LVR, pronounced ``lever''). LVR captures costs incurred by AMM LPs due to stale prices that are picked off by better informed arbitrageurs. We derive closed-form expressions for LVR applicable to all automated market makers. Our model is quantitatively realistic, matching actual LP returns empirically, and shows how CFMM protocols can be redesigned to reduce or eliminate LVR.</description>
