      <title>From Order to Chimeras: Unraveling Dynamic Patterns in Active Fluids with Nonlinear Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore pattern formation in an active fluid system involving two chemical species that regulate active stress: a fast-diffusing species ($A$) and a slow-diffusing species ($I$). The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a nonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase diagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our findings indicate that an increase in the P\'eclet number results in the destabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively, an increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the homogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater asymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while low asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations conducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular, arrhythmic configurations at high P\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust symmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more prevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis indicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth parameters and moderately high P\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find soliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new aggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the phase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse array of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in a chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the nonlinear growth parameter is elevated.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a flux-jump model in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyzed mathematically a model describing flux jumps in superconductivity in a 1D configuration. Three effects occur from fastest to slowest: Joule heating, magnetic relaxation and temperature diffusion. Adimensionalising the equations showed that magnetic field fronts penetrate the material as inhomogeneous Burgers fronts. An additional global term pushes the magnetic field and is responsible for flux jumps. We considered a medium temperature for which the heat capacity of a sample can be taken as a constant and a low temperature where heat capacity depends on temperature causing a nonlinear temperature evolution. As expected, we found that flux jumps occur mostly at low temperature. To understand flux trapping, we examined external magnetic field pulses of different amplitudes and duration. We found that flux trapping is maximal for medium amplitudes and low temperatures.</description>
