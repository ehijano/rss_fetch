      <title>Volatility Forecasting Using Similarity-based Parameter Correction and Aggregated Shock Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a procedure for forecasting the volatility of a time series immediately following a news shock. Adapting the similarity-based framework of Lin and Eck (2020), we exploit series that have experienced similar shocks. We aggregate their shock-induced excess volatilities by positing the shocks to be affine functions of exogenous covariates. The volatility shocks are modeled as random effects and estimated as fixed effects. The aggregation of these estimates is done in service of adjusting the $h$-step-ahead GARCH forecast of the time series under study by an additive term. The adjusted and unadjusted forecasts are evaluated using the unobservable but easily-estimated realized volatility (RV). A real-world application is provided, as are simulation results suggesting the conditions and hyperparameters under which our method thrives.</description>

      <title>A Robust Bayesian approach for reliability prognosis of one-shot devices under cumulative risk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability prognosis of one-shot devices is drawing increasing attention because of their wide applicability. The present study aims to determine the lifetime prognosis of highly durable one-shot device units under a step-stress accelerated life testing (SSALT) experiment applying a cumulative risk model (CRM). In an SSALT experiment, CRM retains the continuity of hazard function by allowing the lag period before the effects of stress change emerge. In an analysis of such lifetime data, plentiful datasets might have outliers where conventional methods like maximum likelihood estimation or likelihood-based Bayesian estimation frequently fail. This work develops a robust estimation method based on density power divergence in classical and Bayesian frameworks. The hypothesis is tested by implementing the Bayes factor based on a robustified posterior. In Bayesian estimation, we exploit Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which has certain advantages over the conventional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. Further, the influence functions are examined to evaluate the robust behaviour of the estimators and the Bayes factor. Finally, the analytical development is validated through a simulation study and a real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Structural Model Updating with Multimodal Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for Bayesian structural model updating and proposes a method that utilizes the surrogate unimodal encoders of a multimodal variational autoencoder. This method facilitates an efficient nonparametric estimation of the likelihood describing the observed data. It is particularly suitable for high-dimensional correlated simultaneous observations applicable to various dynamic analysis models. The proposed approach is benchmarked using a numerical model of a single-story frame building with acceleration and dynamic strain measurements.</description>

      <title>How &amp; Why To Use Audience Segmentation to Maximize (Listener) Demand Across Digital Music Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital delivery of songs has radically changed the way people can enjoy music, the sort of music available for listening, and the manner by which rights holders are compensated for their contributions to songs. Listeners enjoy an unlimited potpourri of sounds, uniquely free of incremental acquisition or switching costs which have been replaced by subscription or rentier fees. This regime shift has revealed listening patterns governed by affinity, boredom, attention budget, etc.: instantaneous, dynamic, organic or programmatic song selection. This regime shift in demand availability -- with the commensurate translation of revenue implications -- deprecates current orthodoxy for content curation. The impulse to point-of-sale model is insufficient in a regime where demand revenue is proportional to demand affinity and each are strongly dependent time series processes. We explore strategies &amp; implications -- which are generalizable to any media rights holding firm -- from a prediction &amp; optimization point of view for two straightforward demand models.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Bayes Approach for Estimating Skill Models for Professional Darts Players</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform an exploratory data analysis on a data-set for the top 16 professional darts players from the 2019 season. We use this data-set to fit player skill models which can then be used in dynamic zero-sum games (ZSGs) that model real-world matches between players. We propose an empirical Bayesian approach based on the Dirichlet-Multinomial (DM) model that overcomes limitations in the data. Specifically we introduce two DM-based skill models where the first model borrows strength from other darts players and the second model borrows strength from other regions of the dartboard. We find these DM-based models outperform simpler benchmark models with respect to Brier and Spherical scores, both of which are proper scoring rules. We also show in ZSGs settings that the difference between DM-based skill models and the simpler benchmark models is practically significant. Finally, we use our DM-model to analyze specific situations that arose in real-world darts matches during the 2019 season.</description>

      <title>Learning Metrics that Maximise Power for Accelerated A/B-Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online controlled experiments are a crucial tool to allow for confident decision-making in technology companies. A North Star metric is defined (such as long-term revenue or user retention), and system variants that statistically significantly improve on this metric in an A/B-test can be considered superior. North Star metrics are typically delayed and insensitive. As a result, the cost of experimentation is high: experiments need to run for a long time, and even then, type-II errors (i.e. false negatives) are prevalent.
  We propose to tackle this by learning metrics from short-term signals that directly maximise the statistical power they harness with respect to the North Star. We show that existing approaches are prone to overfitting, in that higher average metric sensitivity does not imply improved type-II errors, and propose to instead minimise the $p$-values a metric would have produced on a log of past experiments. We collect such datasets from two social media applications with over 160 million Monthly Active Users each, totalling over 153 A/B-pairs. Empirical results show that we are able to increase statistical power by up to 78% when using our learnt metrics stand-alone, and by up to 210% when used in tandem with the North Star. Alternatively, we can obtain constant statistical power at a sample size that is down to 12% of what the North Star requires, significantly reducing the cost of experimentation.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: I. Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the most fundamental problem in statistics, robust location estimation has many prominent solutions, such as the trimmed mean, Winsorized mean, Hodges Lehmann estimator, Huber M estimator, and median of means. Recent studies suggest that their maximum biases concerning the mean can be quite different, but the underlying mechanisms largely remain unclear. This study exploited a semiparametric method to classify distributions by the asymptotic orderliness of quantile combinations with varying breakdown points, showing their interrelations and connections to parametric distributions. Further deductions explain why the Winsorized mean typically has smaller biases compared to the trimmed mean; two sequences of semiparametric robust mean estimators emerge, particularly highlighting the superiority of the median Hodges Lehmann mean. This article sheds light on the understanding of the common nature of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: V. Non-asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the complexity of order statistics, the finite sample behaviour of robust statistics is generally not analytically solvable. While the Monte Carlo method can provide approximate solutions, its convergence rate is typically very slow, making the computational cost to achieve the desired accuracy unaffordable for ordinary users. In this paper, we propose an approach analogous to the Fourier transformation to decompose the finite sample structure of the uniform distribution. By obtaining sets of sequences that are consistent with parametric distributions for the first four sample moments, we can approximate the finite sample behavior of other estimators with significantly reduced computational costs. This article reveals the underlying structure of randomness and presents a novel approach to integrate multiple assumptions.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Trading Strategies for Battery Storage in Reserve and Spot Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantity and price risks are key uncertainties market participants face in electricity markets with increased volatility, for instance, due to high shares of renewables. From day ahead until real-time, there is a large variation in the best available information, leading to price changes that flexible assets, such as battery storage, can exploit economically. This study contributes to understanding how coordinated bidding strategies can enhance multi-market trading and large-scale energy storage integration. Our findings shed light on the complexities arising from interdependencies and the high-dimensional nature of the problem. We show how stochastic dual dynamic programming is a suitable solution technique for such an environment. We include the three markets of the frequency containment reserve, day-ahead, and intraday in stochastic modelling and develop a multi-stage stochastic program. Prices are represented in a multidimensional Markov Chain, following the scheduling of the markets and allowing for time-dependent randomness. Using the example of a battery storage in the German energy sector, we provide valuable insights into the technical aspects of our method and the economic feasibility of battery storage operation. We find that capacity reservation in the frequency containment reserve dominates over the battery's cycling in spot markets at the given resolution on prices in 2022. In an adjusted price environment, we find that coordination can yield an additional value of up to 12.5%.</description>
