      <title>Efficient computation of \lowercase{$f$}-centralities and nonbacktracking centrality for temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss efficient computation of $f$-centralities and nonbacktracking centralities for time-evolving networks with nonnegative weights. We present a node-level formula for its combinatorially exact computation which proves to be more tractable than previously existing formulae at edge-level for dense networks. Additionally, we investigate the impact of the addition of a final time frame to such a time-evolving network, analyzing its effect on the resulting nonbacktracking Katz centrality. Finally, we demonstrate by means of computational experiments that the node-level formula presented is much more efficient for dense networks than the previously known edge-level formula. As a tool for our goals, in an appendix of the paper, we develop a spectral theory of matrices whose elements are vectors.</description>

      <title>Deep Uzawa for PDE constrained optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical solver for optimal control problems constrained by linear and semi-linear second-order elliptic PDEs. The approach is based on recasting the problem and includes an extension of Uzawa's algorithm to build approximating sequences for these constrained optimal control problems. We prove strong convergence of the iterative scheme in their respective norms, and this convergence is generalised to a class of restricted function spaces. We showcase the algorithm by demonstrating its use numerically with neural network methods that we coin Deep Uzawa Algorithms and show they perform favourably compared with some existing Deep Neural Network approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random compressible viscous magnetohydrodynamic flows. Combining the Monte Carlo method with a deterministic finite volume method we solve the random system numerically. Quantitative error estimates including statistical and deterministic errors are analyzed up to a stopping time of the exact solution. On the life-span of an exact strong solution we prove the convergence of the numerical solutions. Numerical experiments illustrate rich dynamics of random viscous compressible magnetohydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the numerical approximation of two variants of hyperbolic mean curvature flow of surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$. For each evolution law we propose both a finite element method, as well as a finite difference scheme in the case of axially symmetric surfaces. We present a number of numerical simulations, including convergence tests as well as simulations suggesting the onset of singularities.</description>

      <title>Comparing the ill-posedness for linear operators in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difficulty for solving ill-posed linear operator equations in Hilbert space is reflected by the strength of ill-posedness of the governing operator, and the inherent solution smoothness. In this study we focus on the ill-posedness of the operator, and we propose a partial ordering for the class of all bounded linear operators which lead to ill-posed operator equations. For compact linear operators, there is a simple characterization in terms of the decay rates of the singular values. In the context of the validity of the spectral theorem the partial ordering can also be understood. We highlight that range inclusions yield partial ordering, and we discuss cases when compositions of compact and non-compact operators occur. Several examples complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A theoretical study on the effect of mass lumping on the discrete frequencies in immersogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In structural dynamics, mass lumping techniques are commonly employed for improving the efficiency of explicit time integration schemes and increasing their critical time step constrained by the largest discrete frequency of the system. For immersogeometric methods, Leidinger first showed in 2020 that under mild conditions on the spline's order and smoothness, the largest frequency was not affected by small trimmed elements if the mass matrix was lumped. This finding was later supported by independent numerical studies. This article is a first attempt at unraveling this property from a theoretical perspective. By combining linear algebra with functional analysis, we derive analytical estimates capturing its behavior for various trimming configurations. Our estimates are then verified numerically for 1D and 2D problems.</description>

      <title>Polytope Division Method: A Scalable Sampling Method for Problems with High-dimensional Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configuration Optimization Problems (COPs), which involve minimizing a loss function over a set of discrete points $\boldsymbol{\gamma} \subset P$, are common in areas like Model Order Reduction, Active Learning, and Optimal Experimental Design. While exact solutions are often infeasible, heuristic methods such as the Greedy Sampling Method (GSM) provide practical alternatives, particularly for low-dimensional cases. GSM recursively updates $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ by solving a continuous optimization problem, which is typically approximated by a search over a discrete sample set $S \subset P$. However, as the dimensionality grows, the sample size suffers from the curse of dimensionality. To address this, we introduce the Polytope Division Method (PDM), a scalable greedy-type approach that adaptively partitions the parameter space and targets regions of high loss. PDM achieves linear scaling with problem dimensionality and offers an efficient solution approach for high-dimensional COPs, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Random space-time sampling and reconstruction of sparse bandlimited graph diffusion field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the sampling and reconstruction of spectrally $s$-sparse bandlimited graph signals governed by heat diffusion processes. We propose a random space-time sampling regime, referred to as {randomized} dynamical sampling, where a small subset of space-time nodes is randomly selected at each time step based on a probability distribution. To analyze the recovery problem, we establish a rigorous mathematical framework by introducing the parameter \textit{the dynamic spectral graph weighted coherence}. This key parameter governs the number of space-time samples needed for stable recovery and extends the idea of variable density sampling to the context of dynamical systems. By optimizing the sampling probability distribution, we show that as few as $\mathcal{O}(s \log(k))$ space-time samples are sufficient for accurate reconstruction in optimal scenarios, where $k$ denotes the bandwidth of the signal. Our framework encompasses both static and dynamic cases, demonstrating a reduction in the number of spatial samples needed at each time step by exploiting temporal correlations. Furthermore, we provide a computationally efficient and robust algorithm for signal reconstruction. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and illustrate the practical efficacy of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>A generalized Frenet frame for computing MHD equilibria in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the representation of axi-symmetric plasma configurations (tokamaks), it is natural to use cylindrical coordinates $(R,Z,\phi)$, where $\phi$ is an independent coordinate. The same cylindrical coordinates have also been widely used for representing 3D MHD equilibria of non-axisymmetric configurations (stellarators), with cross-sections, defined in $(R,Z)$-planes, that vary over $\phi$.
  Stellarator equilibria have been found, however, for which cylindrical coordinates are not at all a natural choice, for instance certain stellarators obtained using the near-axis expansion (NAE), defined by a magnetic axis curve and its Frenet frame.
  In this contribution we demonstrate how to use an \emph{axis-following frame} that we call a 'generalized Frenet frame', as an alternative to using cylindrical coordinates in a 3D MHD equilibrium solver. We see two advantages: 1) the capability to easily represent configurations where the magnetic axis is highly non-planar or even knotted. 2) a reduction in the degrees of freedom needed for the geometry, enabling progress in optimization of these configurations.
  We discuss the definition of the generalized Frenet frame, and details of the implementation of the new frame in the 3D MHD equilibrium solver GVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrate for a highly shaped QI-optimized stellarator that far fewer degrees of freedom are necessary to find a high quality equilibrium solution, compared to the solution computed in cylindrical coordinates.</description>

      <title>Parallel two-scale finite element implementation of a system with varying microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.17040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-scale finite element method designed for heterogeneous microstructures. Our approach exploits domain diffeomorphisms between the microscopic structures to gain computational efficiency. By using a conveniently constructed pullback operator, we are able to model the different microscopic domains as macroscopically dependent deformations of a reference domain. This allows for a relatively simple finite element framework to approximate the underlying PDE system with a parallel computational structure. We apply this technique to a model problem where we focus on transport in plant tissues. We illustrate the accuracy of the implementation with convergence benchmarks and show satisfactory parallelization speed-ups. We further highlight the effect of the heterogeneous microscopic structure on the output of the two-scale systems. Our implementation (publicly available on GitHub) builds on the deal.II FEM library. Application of this technique allows for an increased capacity of microscopic detail in multiscale modeling, while keeping running costs manageable.</description>

      <title>Integral Operator Approaches for Scattered Data Fitting on Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on scattered data fitting problems on spheres. We study the approximation performance of a class of weighted spectral filter algorithms, including Tikhonov regularization, Landaweber iteration, spectral cut-off, and iterated Tikhonov, in fitting noisy data with possibly unbounded random noise. For the analysis, we develop an integral operator approach that can be regarded as an extension of the widely used sampling inequality approach and norming set method in the community of scattered data fitting. After providing an equivalence between the operator differences and quadrature rules, we succeed in deriving optimal Sobolev-type error estimates of weighted spectral filter algorithms. Our derived error estimates do not suffer from the saturation phenomenon for Tikhonov regularization in the literature, native-space-barrier for existing error analysis and adapts to different embedding spaces. We also propose a divide-and-conquer scheme to equip weighted spectral filter algorithms to reduce their computational burden and present the optimal approximation error bounds.</description>

      <title>Near and full quasi-optimality of finite element approximations of stationary second-order mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a priori error bounds for monotone stabilized finite element discretizations of stationary second-order mean field games (MFG) on Lipschitz polytopal domains. Under suitable hypotheses, we prove that the approximation is asymptotically nearly quasi-optimal in the $H^1$-norm in the sense that, on sufficiently fine meshes, the error between exact and computed solutions is bounded by the best approximation error of the corresponding finite element space, plus possibly an additional term, due to the stabilization, that is of optimal order with respect to the mesh size. We thereby deduce optimal rates of convergence of the error with respect to the mesh-size for solutions with sufficient regularity. We further show full asymptotic quasi-optimality of the approximation error in the more restricted case of sequences of strictly acute meshes. Our third main contribution is to further show, in the case where the domain is convex, that the convergence rate for the $H^1$-norm error of the value function approximation remains optimal even if the density function only has minimal regularity in $H^1$.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit for discrete NLS with memory effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05681</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.05681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with long-range interactions and a memory effect on the infinite lattice $h\Z$ with mesh-size $h&gt;0$. Such models are common in the study of charge and energy transport in biomolecules. Given that the distance between base pairs is small, we consider the continuum limit: a sharp approximation to the system as $h\rightarrow 0$. In this limit, we prove that solutions to this discrete equation converge strongly in $L^2$ to the solution to a continuous NLS-type equation with a memory effect, and we compute the precise rate of convergence. In order to obtain these results, we generalize some recent ideas proposed by Hong and Yang in $L^2$-based spaces to classical functional settings in dispersive PDEs involving the smoothing effect and maximal function estimates, as originally introduced in the pioneering works of Kenig, Ponce and Vega. We believe that our approach may therefore be adapted to tackle continuum limits of more general dispersive equations.</description>

      <title>Stable generative modeling using Schr\"odinger bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. Such settings have recently drawn considerable interest in the context of generative modelling and Bayesian inference. In this paper, we propose a generative model combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. Schr\"odinger bridges over an appropriate reversible reference process are used to approximate the conditional transition probability from the available training samples, which is then implemented in a discrete-time reversible Langevin sampler to generate new samples. By setting the kernel bandwidth in the reference process to match the time step size used in the unadjusted Langevin algorithm, our method effectively circumvents any stability issues typically associated with the time-stepping of stiff stochastic differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a novel split-step scheme, ensuring that the generated samples remain within the convex hull of the training samples. Our framework can be naturally extended to generate conditional samples and to Bayesian inference problems. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing dimensions and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem as well as generating sample trajectories of a dynamical system using conditional sampling.</description>

Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable for the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While the capabilities of MPM on a wide range continuum mechanics problem have been already well assessed, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics has received less attention. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency in order to provide a first assessment of the potential of this approach in solving strongly compressible gas flow problems, also taking into account solid obstacles. The numerical model considered constitutes a first step towards the development of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

      <title>Transient Evaluation of Non-Markovian Models by Stochastic State Classes and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian models have great expressive power, at the cost of complex analysis of the stochastic process. The method of Stochastic State Classes (SSCs) derives closed-form analytical expressions for the joint Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of the active timers with marginal expolynomial PDF, though being hindered by the number of concurrent non-exponential timers and of discrete events between regenerations. Simulation is an alternative capable of handling the large class of PDFs samplable via inverse transform, which however suffers from rare events. We combine these approaches to analyze time-bounded transient properties of non-Markovian models. We enumerate SSCs near the root of the state-space tree and then rely on simulation to reach the target, affording transient evaluation of models for which the method of SSCs is not viable while reducing computational time and variance of the estimator of transient probabilities with respect to simulation. Promising results are observed in the estimation of rare event probabilities.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for Physics Informed Neural Networks in Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations placed on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the subcritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) in dimension one posed on the unbounded real line. Several previous works have considered the deep neural network approximation of NLS solutions from the numerical and theoretical point of view in the case of bounded domains. In this paper, we introduce a new PINNs method to treat the case of unbounded domains and show rigorous bounds on the associated approximation error in terms of the energy and Strichartz norms, provided a reasonable integration scheme is available. Applications to traveling waves, breathers and solitons, as well as numerical experiments confirming the validity of the approximation are also presented as well.</description>
