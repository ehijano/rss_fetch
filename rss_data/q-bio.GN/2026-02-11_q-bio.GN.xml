      <title>Predicting Gene Disease Associations in Type 2 Diabetes Using Machine Learning on Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to impaired insulin production or function. Two main forms are recognized: type 1 diabetes (T1D), which involves autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing \b{eta}-cells, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which arises from insulin resistance and progressive \b{eta}-cell dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases is essential for the development of improved therapeutic strategies, particularly those targeting \b{eta}-cell dysfunction. To investigate these mechanisms in a controlled and biologically interpretable setting, mouse models have played a central role in diabetes research. Owing to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans, together with the ability to precisely manipulate their genome, mice enable detailed investigation of disease progression and gene function. In particular, mouse models have provided critical insights into \b{eta}-cell development, cellular heterogeneity, and functional failure under diabetic conditions. Building on these experimental advances, this study applies machine learning methods to single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse pancreatic islets. Specifically, we evaluate two supervised approaches identified in the literature; Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), to assess their ability to identify T2D-associated gene expression signatures at single-cell resolution. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, with an emphasis on interpretability and biological relevance</description>

      <title>scBench: Evaluating AI Agents on Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As single-cell RNA sequencing datasets grow in adoption, scale, and complexity, data analysis remains a bottleneck for many research groups. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world single-cell datasets. We introduce scBench, a benchmark of 394 verifiable problems derived from practical scRNA-seq workflows spanning six sequencing platforms and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on eight frontier models shows that accuracy ranges from 29-53%, with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Platform choice affects accuracy as much as model choice, with 40+ percentage point drops on less-documented technologies. scBench complements SpatialBench to cover the two dominant single-cell modalities, serving both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can analyze real scRNA-seq datasets faithfully and reproducibly.</description>

      <title>AntigenLM: Structure-Aware DNA Language Modeling for Influenza</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models have advanced sequence analysis, yet DNA foundation models often lag behind task-specific methods for unclear reasons. We present AntigenLM, a generative DNA language model pretrained on influenza genomes with intact, aligned functional units. This structure-aware pretraining enables AntigenLM to capture evolutionary constraints and generalize across tasks. Fine-tuned on time-series hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences, AntigenLM accurately forecasts future antigenic variants across regions and subtypes, including those unseen during training, outperforming phylogenetic and evolution-based models. It also achieves near-perfect subtype classification. Ablation studies show that disrupting genomic structure through fragmentation or shuffling severely degrades performance, revealing the importance of preserving functional-unit integrity in DNA language modeling. AntigenLM thus provides both a powerful framework for antigen evolution prediction and a general principle for building biologically grounded DNA foundation models.</description>

      <title>Population-scale Ancestral Recombination Graphs with tskit 1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) are an increasingly important component of population and statistical genetics. The tskit library has become key infrastructure for the field, providing an expressive and general representation of ARGs together with a suite of efficient fundamental operations. In this note, we announce tskit version 1.0, describe its underlying rationale, and document its stability guarantees. These guarantees provide a foundation for durable computational artefacts and support long-term reproducibility of code and analyses.</description>

      <title>scRNA-seq of preeclamptic trophoblasts identifies EBI3, COL17A1, miR-27a-5p, and miR-193b-5p as hypoxia markers: validation of neuradapt as a superior mimetic to cobalt chloride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background. Preeclampsia (PE) complicates 2-8% of pregnancies and involves placental hypoxia and HIF-pathway activation, especially in early-onset PE (eoPE). Chemical mimetics like cobalt (II) chloride (CoCl2) and oxyquinoline derivatives model trophoblast hypoxia in vitro, yet their fidelity in recapitulating PE gene profiles remains unclear. Integrating patient tissue analyses with experimental models may reveal common markers and validate physiologically relevant paradigms.
  Methods. We analyzed scRNA-seq data from 10 eoPE, 7 late-onset PE, and matched control placentas, identifying villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, and extravillous trophoblast (EVT). BeWo b30 cells were treated for 24 h with CoCl2 (300 $\mu$M) or the oxyquinoline derivative neuradapt (5 $\mu$M) to induce hypoxia. RNA-seq with qPCR validation and small RNA-seq quantified mRNA and microRNA changes; PROGENy inferred pathway activities.
  Results. scRNA-seq revealed highest hypoxia activation in eoPE, with EVT showing maximum activity. Nine genes were upregulated across all trophoblast types (EBI3, CST6, FN1, RFK, COL17A1, LDHA, PKP2, RPS4Y1, RPS26). In vitro, neuradapt induced more specific hypoxia responses than CoCl2 (1284 vs. 3032 differentially expressed genes). Critically, EBI3, FN1, and COL17A1 showed concordant upregulation in tissue and neuradapt-treated cells, whereas CoCl2 produced opposite patterns. MicroRNAs hsa-miR-27a-5p and hsa-miR-193b-5p were consistently elevated in both models; 3'-isoforms of hsa-miR-9-5p and hsa-miR-92b-3p were identified as hypoxia-associated.
  Conclusions. EBI3, COL17A1, miR-27a-5p, and miR-193b-5p emerge as trophoblast hypoxia markers. Neuradapt (a selective HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor) provides a more physiologically relevant in vitro model than CoCl2, recapitulating transcriptomic signatures observed in PE placentas.</description>
