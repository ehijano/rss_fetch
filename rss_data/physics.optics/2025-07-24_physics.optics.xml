      <title>Photonic chip-based optical frequency division with PZT-integrated soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) produces low-noise microwave and millimeter-wave signals by transferring the exceptional stability of optical references to electronic frequency domains. Recent developments in integrated optical references and soliton microcombs have paved the way for miniaturizing OFD oscillators to chip scale. Critical to this realization is a rapid tunable frequency comb that is stabilized to the optical references, thereby coherently linking optical and electronic frequencies. In this work, we advance the on-chip OFD technology using an integrated high-speed PZT stress-optic actuator on the SiN soliton microcomb resonator. The integrated PZT actuator tunes the resonance frequency of the soliton-generating microresonator with a bandwidth exceeding 10s MHz and independently adjusts the soliton repetition rate without perturbing the frequency comb offset. Optical frequency division and low-noise mmWave generation are demonstrated by feedback control of the soliton repetition rate through the integrated PZT-actuator, and the soliton microcomb is stabilized to a pair of reference lasers that are locked to an integrated 4-meter SiN coil reference cavity. Our approach provides a fast, versatile and integrated control mechanism for OFD oscillators and their applications in advanced communications, sensing, and precise timing.</description>

      <title>Integrated Architecture for the Automated Generation and Coil Stabilization of a PZT-Enabled Microcomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride Dissipative Kerr Soliton (DKS) microcombs have emerged as a future solution to bring metrological optical frequency comb capabilities into a photonic integrated platform with mass-scale fabrication benefits. Precision applications demand low comb line phase noise as well as high repetition rate stability, but current approaches to achieve this involve complex architectures, multiple lasers, and high-power components, which are challenging to integrate to the chip scale. To achieve this goal, new architectures are needed to simplify the comb generation, actuation, and pump laser requirements, while enabling chip-integrated solutions. Here we demonstrate a greatly simplified stabilized DKS comb architecture with a single laser and a single point electronic control of both the microcomb generation and its stabilization to a coil-resonator reference. The silicon nitride microcomb is integrated with a low power, broadband PZT actuator that is driven by a simple electronic control sequence that generates a soliton and stabilizes it to the 16-meter silicon nitride coil resonator. PZT-enabled control brings flexibility and simplicity to the soliton generation and stabilization using a single CW pump laser, resulting in significantly reduced electronic and optical infrastructure. We demonstrate coil-resonator locking which suppresses the 1 kHz frequency noise by 40 dB over the 35 nm wide comb spectrum, with comb line linewidths as low as 66 Hz and 108 GHz soliton repetition rate phase noise equivalent to -118 dBc/Hz when divided down to 10 GHz. The low power PZT actuator consumes nW bias power and the coil resonator allows flexible dual locking using arbitrary comb lines. These results show a clear path towards full chip integration of stabilized soliton microcombs with simplicity and versatility absent in other schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of an integrated optical chip is proposed containing a rotation sensing ring resonator (optical gyroscope) coupled to an inverse weak value amplified Sagnac interferometer that amplifies the signal containing the phase information. We show that, for conservative parameter choices, our setup has a minimum detectable angular rotation rate of 0.1 deg/hr and an Allan deviation of 0.08 deg/hr under expected ideal conditions. We also show that for an appropriate amount of input power, our design can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, the precision of angular rotation rate, and error in detection by more than ten times compared to a Sagnac interferometer coupled to a ring resonator.</description>

      <title>Direct fiber-coupled soliton microcomb system with enhanced stability and reproducibility via high numerical-aperture polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers and temperature control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a compact and robust system architecture for soliton microcomb generation, based on two key techniques: direct fiber coupling using high numerical-aperture polarization-maintaining single-mode fibers (high-NA PMFs) and active temperature control of the microresonator. These complementary strategies address two major challenges in microcomb implementation: environmental sensitivity and resonance instability. Building on prior work using single-mode fiber (SMF)-based direct coupling, which demonstrated device miniaturization and partial suppression of thermal drift in coupling efficiency, our PMF-based approach offers enhanced thermal stability and significantly greater robustness to environmental disturbances such as temperature fluctuations and vibration. In our system, precision alignment using microscopes or multi-axis stages is no longer required, enabling a simplified optical setup and stable long-term operation. The direct coupling scheme achieved a coupling efficiency of 57.7% and maintained soliton operation for over 24 hours under external perturbations. In parallel, active temperature control of the microresonator was quantitatively evaluated, reducing the wavelength variation of the pump and auxiliary lasers by 79% and 97%, respectively. This stability enables reproducible soliton generation even in thermally dynamic environments. Comparative experiments with SMF-based direct coupling and lensed-SMF-based free-space coupling systems confirmed the superior performance of the PMF-based design in terms of coupling stability, soliton lifetime, and immunity to environmental noise. The architecture developed in this study lays a strong foundation for future integration into compact modules, paving the way for portable and robust microcomb sources in real-world photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Nonthermal Ablation of Copper Nanoparticles under Femtosecond Laser Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond (fs) laser sintering enables ultrafast and spatially localized energy deposition, making it attractive for additive manufacturing of metal nanoparticles. However, undesired ablation during fs irradiation of copper (Cu) nanoparticles often disrupts uniform sintering, and the underlying ablation mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the fragmentation and coalescence behavior of Cu nanoparticles subjected to fs laser scanning under fluence conditions relevant to sintering applications. Particle size distributions extracted from scanning electron microscopy reveal a bimodal transformation: emergence of sub-60\,nm debris and formation of large aggregates up to 750 nm. We evaluate two candidate mechanisms -- Coulomb explosion and hot electron blast -- by estimating electron emission, electrostatic pressure, and hot electron temperature using the Richardson--Dushman equation and two-temperature modeling. Our analysis shows that Coulomb explosion is unlikely under the laser fluence used ($\sim$27\,mJ/cm$^2$), as the estimated electrostatic pressure ($\sim$4 kPa) is orders of magnitude below the cohesive strength of Cu. In contrast, hot electron blast is identified as the dominant ablation pathway, with electron temperatures exceeding 5,000 K and resulting blast pressures above 4 GPa. Thermal modeling also suggests moderate lattice heating ($\sim$930\,K), enabling softening and fusion of partially fragmented particles. These results confirm that fs laser-induced ablation in Cu nanoparticles is driven predominantly by nonthermal electron dynamics rather than classical melting or evaporation. Importantly, this work highlights that reducing hot electron temperature -- such as through double-pulse irradiation schemes -- can effectively suppress ablation and expand the sintering window, offering a promising strategy for precision nanoscale additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Low loss monolithic barium titanate on insulator integrated photonics with intrinsic quality factor &gt;1 million</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BTO) has been experiencing a surge of interest for integrated photonics technologies because of its large nonlinear optical coefficients, especially the Pockels coefficient, and in part due to newly available thin-film substrates. In this work, we report on the development of a redeposition-free dry etching technique for monolithic BTO-on-insulator photonics, that produces very low-roughness and high-verticality waveguides. Using this, we experimentally demonstrate the first BTO microresonators with intrinsic Q-factor $&gt; 1$ million, and waveguide propagation loss as small as 0.32 dB/cm, representing the lowest losses reported in any BTO-based integrated platform to date. We additionally demonstrate Mach-Zehnder amplitude modulators with $V_{\pi}L = 0.54$ V$\cdot$cm and effective electro-optic coefficient $r_\text{eff} = 162$ pm/V.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic studies on different SiN films in terms of propagation losses are presented, and deuterated SiN emerges as a good candidate for ultralow loss (&lt; 0.1 dB/cm) and reliability by simple 8-inch process with low thermal budget. Frequency comb generation in high-Q (~1 million) deuterated silicon nitride microring is demonstrated and used for intensity modulated direct detection transmission. Negligible power penalty for 25.78 GBaud/s NRZ and PAM4 is achieved at error rates &lt;10-6, below the FEC limit.</description>

      <title>All Optical Classification Surpasses Cascaded Diffractive Networks through Dual Wavelength Differential Modulation within a Single Layer Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs), which perform computation using light instead of electrons, offer a promising pathway toward accelerating artificial intelligence by leveraging the inherent advantages of optics in speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency. However, conventional multi-layer D2NNs suffer from inter-layer misalignments that significantly increase system complexity and degrade performance, particularly under visible-light operation where optical alignment is highly sensitive.
  Here, we present a compact, single-layer dual-wavelength differential D2NN that combines wavelength-division multiplexing with differential intensity detection to enable high-accuracy all-optical classification while substantially reducing hardware complexity. By encoding complementary spatial frequency information at two distinct wavelengths, the proposed network overcomes non-negativity constraints and feature loss inherent to single-wavelength systems.
  Our numerical experiments achieve outstanding classification accuracies of 98.59% on MNIST and 90.4% on Fashion MNIST using only 40k trainable parameters surpassing the performance of conventional five layer D2NNs (91.33% and 83.67%, respectively) with merely 20% of the parameter count. Furthermore, the network maintains strong performance with only 10k parameters and demonstrates enhanced robustness against random phase perturbations, optical occlusions, and input noise.
  To best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of a single layer diffractive optical network that achieves such high classification accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for compact, robust, and shallow photonic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Maximal optical chirality via mode coupling in bilayer metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the physics of resonant optical metasurfaces allowed to realize the so-called {\it maximum chirality} of planar structures by engineering their geometric parameters. Here we employ bilayer membrane metasurfaces with a square lattice of rotated C$_4$-symmetric holes and uncover very different scenarios of chirality maximization by virtue of strong coupling of photonic eigenmodes of the membranes supplemented by smart engineering of dissipation losses. Our findings substantially expand the class of planar maximally chiral resonant surfaces feasible for widespread nanolithography techniques desired for metaphotonic applications in chiral sensing, chiral light emission, detection and polarization conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformation optics establishes an equivalence relationship between gradient media and curved space, unveiling intrinsic geometric properties of gradient media. However, this approach based on curved spaces is concentrated on two-dimensional manifolds, namely curved surfaces. In this Letter, we establish an intrinsic connection between three-dimensional manifolds and three-dimensional gradient media in transformation optics by leveraging the Yamabe problem and Ricci scalar curvature, a measure of spatial curvature in manifolds. The invariance of the Ricci scalar under conformal mappings is proven. Our framework is validated through the analysis of representative conformal optical lenses.</description>

      <title>Phase-adaptive cooling of fringe-trapped nanoparticles at room temperature in hollow-core photonic crystal fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active feedback cooling of levitated dielectric particles is a pivotal technique for creating ultrasensitive sensors and probing fundamental physics. Here we demonstrate phase-adaptive feedback cooling of silica nanoparticles optically trapped in standing-wave potential formed by two co-linearly polarized counterpropagating diffraction-free guided modes in a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber at room temperature. Unlike standard laser intensity- or Coulomb force-based feedback, our approach modulates the relative optical phase between the counterpropagating fundamental modes proportionally to the particle's axial momentum. This generates a Stokes-like dissipative force which effectively damps the center-of-mass motion without introducing excess heating and can also work with uncharged particles. At 2 mbar air pressure, the axial center-of-mass temperature of a 195 nm silica particle is reduced by half upon application of the feedback and to 58.6 K at 0.5 mbar. The measured mechanical spectra agree well with our analytical model, validating the cooling mechanism. We envision this approach will open up pathways towards long-range, coherent control of mesoscopic particles inside hollow-core fibers, offering a fiber-integrated versatile platform for future quantum manipulation.</description>

Abstract: A continuous-wave laser source at 148.4 nm based on second-harmonic generation in randomly quasi-phase matched strontium tetraborate, SrB4O7, is demonstrated. It provides (1.3-0.6+0.7) nW of VUV power in a single pass for an incident UV laser power of 325 mW. The laser system is developed for the resonant laser excitation of the 229Th nucleus to its low-energy isomeric state. For a frequency-stabilized laser system we expect to reach similar VUV power spectral densities as in previous pulsed laser excitation experiments of the nuclear transition in 229Th-doped crystals.</description>

      <title>Single attosecond XUV pulse source via light-wave controlled relativistic laser-plasma interaction: Thomson Back Scattering Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reflecting light off a mirror moving near light speed, as first envisioned by Einstein, offers a powerful method for generating bright, ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet range. Recent breakthroughs show that dense relativistic electron mirrors can be created by striking a nanometre-scale foil with a high-intensity, sharp-front laser pulse, forming a single relativistic electron sheet (RES). This RES coherently reflects and upshifts a counter-propagating laser beam from the infrared to the extreme ultraviolet with efficiency exceeding incoherent scattering by over several orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that optimizing the drive laser waveform can reliably produce a single RES, leading to generation of isolated \emph{attosecond} pulses enhancing both intensity and temporal compression of the back reflected light in a controlled manner. Simulations reveal that tuning parameters like timing delay enables control over the amplitude, duration, and bandwidth of the resulting attosecond Thomson backscattering (TBS) pulse. Together, these advances meet key experimental challenges and pave the way for compact, tunable sources of isolated attosecond pulses for probing ultrafast phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modifying electronic and structural properties of 2D van der Waals materials via cavity quantum vacuum fluctuations: A first-principles QEDFT study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structuring the photon density of states and light-matter coupling in optical cavities has emerged as a promising approach to modifying the equilibrium properties of materials through strong light-matter interactions. In this article, we employ state-of-the-art quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) to study the modifications of the electronic and structural properties of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) layered materials by the cavity vacuum field fluctuations. We find that cavity photons modify the electronic density through localization along the photon polarization directions, a universal effect observed for all the 2D materials studied here. This modification of the electronic structure tunes the material properties, such as the shifting of energy valleys in monolayer h-BN and 2H-MoS$_2$, enabling tunable band gaps. Also, it tunes the interlayer spacing in bilayer 2H-MoS$_2$ and T$_\text{d}$-MoTe$_2$, allowing for adjustable ferroelectric, nonlinear Hall effect, and optical properties, as a function of light-matter coupling strength. Our findings open an avenue for engineering a broad range of 2D layered quantum materials by tuning vdW interactions through fluctuating cavity photon fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization between two strongly driven YIG spheres mediated via a microwave cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of synchronization between two strongly driven magnon modes indirectly coupled via a single-mode microwave cavity. Each magnon mode, hosted in separate Yttrium Iron Garnet spheres, interacts coherently with the cavity field, leading to cavity-mediated nonlinear coupling. We show, by using input-output formalism, that both classical and quantum synchronization emerge for appropriate choices of coupling, detuning, and driving. We find that thermal noise reduces quantum synchronization, highlighting the importance of low-temperature conditions. This study provides useful insights into tunable magnonic interactions in cavity systems, with possible applications in quantum information processing and hybrid quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Using optical tweezers to simultaneously trap, charge and measure the charge of a microparticle in air</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers are widely used as a highly sensitive tool to measure forces on micron-scale particles. One such application is the measurement of the electric charge of a particle, which can be done with high precision in liquids, air, or vacuum. We experimentally investigate how the trapping laser itself can electrically charge such a particle, in our case a $\sim 1\,\mathrm{\mu m\;SiO_2}$ sphere in air. We model the charging mechanism as a two-photon process which reproduces the experimental data with high fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Brillouin scattering enables efficient and coherent conversion between optical photons and gigahertz-frequency phonons. Integrated circuits that harness this nonlinear interaction have immense potential for signal processing, quantum transduction, and sensing applications. However, achieving strong overlap and tight confinement of optical and mechanical modes in silicon nanophotonic waveguides remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel strategy that enables independent control of optical and mechanical modes in periodically segmented silicon waveguides. Our approach combines two distinct periodic lattices: one with a period shorter than half of the optical wavelength, providing light guiding by metamaterial-induced index contrast, and another that creates a complete phononic bandgap confining acoustic modes. This dual-lattice strategy opens new degrees of freedom to optimize optomechanical confinement and coupling simultaneously. Based on this approach, we experimentally demonstrate remarkably high Brillouin gain of $G_\mathrm{B}=2673$ W$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$, resulting in a Stokes gain of 3 dB and an anti-Stokes loss of 4 dB with 6.4 MHz mechanical linewidth. These results illustrate the potential of subwavelength silicon metamaterials for engineering on-chip optomechanical interactions.</description>

      <title>Versatile Optical Frequency Division with Kerr-induced Synchronization at Tunable Microcomb Synthetic Dispersive Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) provides a new key tool for the control and stabilization of the repetition rate of a cavity soliton frequency comb. It enables direct external control of a given comb tooth of a dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) thanks to its capture by an injected reference laser. Efficient KIS requires its coupling energy to be sufficiently large, and hence both the comb tooth and intracavity reference power must be optimized, which can be achieved through higher-order dispersion that enables phase-matched dispersive waves (DWs), where comb teeth are on resonance. However, such a design is highly restrictive, preventing arbitrary use of reference wavelengths away from the DW(s). In particular, for large spectral separations from the main pump the cavity dispersion yields large detuning between comb teeth and their respective cavity resonances, thereby decreasing the coupling energy and rendering KIS to be highly inefficient or practically impossible. Here, we demonstrate an alternative KIS method where efficient synchronization can be tailored at arbitrary modes as needed. Using a multi-color DKS created from multi-pumping a microresonator, a synthetic DW at the second-color wavepacket can be selectively created where otherwise dispersion is far too large for KIS to be experimentally feasible. Since a unique group velocity for both colors exists thanks to cross-phase modulation, the repetition rate disciplining of the secondary color wavepacket through its KIS automatically translates into the DKS microcomb control. We first investigate this color-KIS phenomenon theoretically, and then experimentally demonstrate its control and tuning of the soliton microcomb repetition rate. As a consequence, we demonstrate optical frequency division that is uncoupled from the main pump that generates the DKS.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase gradient microscopy with spatially entangled photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entanglement-based quantitative phase gradient microscopy technique that employs principles from quantum ghost imaging and ghost diffraction. In this method, a transparent sample is illuminated by both photons of an entangled pair - one detected in the near-field (position) and the other in the far-field (momentum). Due to the strong correlations offered by position-momentum entanglement, both conjugate observables can be inferred nonlocally, effectively enabling simultaneous access to the sample's transmission and phase gradient information. This dual-domain measurement allows for the quantitative recovery of the full amplitude and phase profile of the sample. Unlike conventional classical and quantum phase imaging methods, our approach requires no interferometry, spatial scanning, microlens arrays, or iterative phase-retrieval algorithms, thereby circumventing many of their associated limitations. Furthermore, intrinsic temporal correlations between entangled photons provide robustness against dynamic and structured background light. We demonstrate quantitative phase and amplitude imaging with a spatial resolution of 2.76 $\mu$m and a phase sensitivity of $\lambda/100$ using femtowatts of illuminating power, representing the highest performance reported to date in quantum phase imaging. This technique opens new possibilities for non-invasive imaging of photosensitive samples, wavefront sensing in adaptive optics, and imaging under complex lighting environments.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present reinforcement-learning quantum-logic spectroscopy (RL-QLS), a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in single, pure quantum states. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated for the polyatomic molecule H$_3$O$^+$ with 130 thermally populated eigenstates and degenerate transitions within inversion doublets, where quantum Markov decision process modeling and a physics-informed reward function play a key role, as well as for CaH$^+$ under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. The developed theoretical framework cohesively integrates techniques from quantum chemistry, AMO physics, and artificial intelligence, and we expect that the results can be readily implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, thereby enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>

Abstract: Laser cooling is fundamental to quantum computation and metrology with trapped ions, and can occupy a majority of runtime in current systems. A key limitation to cooling arises from unwanted carrier excitation, which in typically used running wave (RW) fields invariably accompanies the sideband transitions effecting cooling. We consider laser cooling in structured light profiles enabling selective sideband excitation with nulled carrier drive; motivated by integrated photonic approaches' passive phase and amplitude stability, we propose simple configurations realizable with waveguide addressing using either standing wave (SW) or first-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes. We quantify performance of Doppler cooling from beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime (LDR), and ground-state (GS) cooling using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) leveraging these field profiles. Carrier-free EIT offers significant benefits simultaneously in cooling rate, motional frequency bandwidth, and final phonon number. Carrier-free Doppler cooling's advantage is significantly compromised beyond the LDR but continues to hold, indicating such configurations are applicable for highly excited ions. Our simulations focus on level structure relevant to $^{40}$Ca$^+$, though the carrier-free configurations can be generally applied to other species. We also quantify performance limitations due to polarization and modal impurities relevant to experimental implementation. Our results indicate potential for simple structured light profiles to alleviate bottlenecks in laser cooling, and for scalable photonic devices to improve basic operation quality in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Self Seed in 391-nm N$_2^{+}$ Air Lasing by Vectorially Structured Light Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single intense near-infrared femtosecond laser beam can remotely generate ultraviolet N$_2^{+}$ lasing in the air, offering a promising light source in the atmosphere. One of the key debates regarding its mechanism is whether it is seeded by a self-generated spectral component, such as the second harmonic, which is inevitably produced by the charge gradient in the laser plasma filament. In this study, we generated both radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing at 391 nm driven by a single 800-nm cylindrical vector beam. Subsequently, the same vector beam was employed to drive argon for the second harmonic generation. The radially polarized pump beam can produce radially polarized second harmonics with higher radial order, while the azimuthally polarized pump beam yields no second harmonic generation, owing to the special mechanism of the ponderomotive effect. The absence of azimuthally polarized second harmonic strongly ruled out the hypothesis of self-seeding by the second harmonic because radially and azimuthally polarized N$_2^{+}$ lasing signals show comparable intensities. By characterizing the spatial phase distribution of the vector 391-nm lasing, we concluded that the phase of the 391-nm lasing is synchronized with the driving field. The experimental results suggest that amplified spontaneous emissions are the origin of N$_2^+$ air lasing, which was effectively demonstrated by theoretical simulations. Our work also provides a promising method for remotely generating vectorially structured ultraviolet light fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of two-dimensional excitonic vdW layers and an optically resonant patterned vdW thin film. We show that the radiative losses of the exciton can be completely suppressed - not through conventional methods such as total internal reflection, Bragg mirrors, or metallic layers - but instead via destructive interference of exciton emission rates to distinct optical modes of the metasurface. We formulate the general conditions of excitonic BICs as a vanishing Purcell factor with non-vanishing vacuum local density of states at the exciton frequency. We propose a mechanism to achieve excitonic quasi-BICs with almost complete suppression of radiation via exciton coupling with a guided-mode resonance and multiple Fabry-P\'{e}rot modes. We show that in unpatterned vdW slabs, the Purcell factor suppression is defined exclusively by the slab's permittivity achieved via positioning the 2D exciton layer in the minimum of the mode electric field. We confirm through numerical simulations that, in periodically patterned heterostructure metasurfaces, the Purcell factor can be suppressed by more than five orders of magnitude, and this effect is not due to vanishing local electric fields. Our results demonstrate the formation of excitonic quasi-BICs and their potential for advancing quantum optics and information processing.</description>

Abstract: The results of a study of the dynamics of atomic moments alignment in cesium under optical pumping by linearly polarized resonant light in ultra-weak magnetic field are presented. It is shown that there are alignment components whose relaxation does not depend on spin-exchange broadening. The effect of suppression of spin-exchange relaxation in zero magnetic fields is detected, which is similar in its manifestations to the SERF (Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free) effect observed in orientation signals. This observation is interesting from the standpoint of general theory, since the law of conservation of angular momentum responsible for maintaining orientation in the SERF mode should not guarantee the preservation of alignment under the same conditions. A comparison with theoretically calculated parameters of SERF resonances in orientation is given. A qualitative explanation of the observed effect is presented.</description>

      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>
