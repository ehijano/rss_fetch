      <title>Bifurcations and Phase Transitions in the Origins of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path toward the emergence of life in our biosphere involved several key events allowing for the persistence, reproduction and evolution of molecular systems. All these processes took place in a given environmental context and required both molecular diversity and the right non-equilibrium conditions to sustain and favour complex self-sustaining molecular networks capable of evolving by natural selection. Life is a process that departs from non-life in several ways and cannot be reduced to standard chemical reactions. Moreover, achieving higher levels of complexity required the emergence of novelties. How did that happen? Here, we review different case studies associated with the early origins of life in terms of phase transitions and bifurcations, using symmetry breaking and percolation as two central components. We discuss simple models that allow for understanding key steps regarding life origins, such as molecular chirality, the transition to the first replicators and cooperators, the problem of error thresholds and information loss, and the potential for "order for free" as the basis for the emergence of life.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Without Crystal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08597v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a collinear magnetic order in which opposite spin species are exchanged under a real-space rotation. Hence, the search for physical realizations has focussed on crystalline solids with specific rotational symmetry. Here, we show that altermagnetism can also emerge in non-crystalline systems, such as amorphous solids, despite the lack of global rotational symmetries. We construct a Hamiltonian with two directional orbitals per site on an amorphous lattice with interactions that are invariant under spin rotation. Altermagnetism then arises due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the spin and orbital degrees of freedom around each atom, displaying a common point group symmetry. This form of altermagnetism exhibits anisotropic spin transport and spin spectral functions, both experimentally measurable. Our mechanism generalizes to any lattice and any altermagnetic order, opening the search for altermagnetic phenomena to non-crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Strange Attractors in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder and noise in physical systems often disrupt spatial and temporal regularity, yet chaotic systems reveal how order can emerge from unpredictable behavior. Complex networks, spatial analogs of chaos, exhibit disordered, non-Euclidean architectures with hidden symmetries, hinting at spontaneous order. Finding low-dimensional embeddings that reveal network patterns and link them to dimensionality that governs universal behavior remains a fundamental open challenge, as it needs to bridge the gap between microscopic disorder and macroscopic regularities. Here, the minimal space revealing key network properties is introduced, showing that non-integer dimensions produce chaotic-like attractors.</description>

      <title>Ising machine by dimensional collapse of nonlinear polarization oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines show promise as ultrafast hardware for optimizations encoded in Ising Hamiltonians but fall short in terms of success rate and performance scaling. Here, we propose a novel Ising machine that exploits the three-dimensional nature of nonlinear polarization oscillators to counteract these limitations. Based on the evolution of the optical polarization in third-order nonlinear media, the high-dimensional machine reaches the Ising ground state by the mechanism of dimensional collapse: the dynamics on the Poincar\'e sphere undergoes a self-induced collapse into polarization fixed points mapping Ising spins. The photonic setup consists of polarization-modulated pulses in a $\chi^{(3)}$ crystal subject to iterative feedback. We numerically demonstrate that its high-dimensional operation leads to an enhanced success probability on benchmark graphs and an exponential improvement in performance scaling with respect to coherent Ising machines. The proposed polarization Ising machine paves the way for a new class of Ising solvers with enhanced computing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Topological Symmetry Breaking in Antagonistic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.</description>
