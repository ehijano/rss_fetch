      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Port Logistics: A Bibliometric Analysis of Technological Integration and Research Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores the transformation of port logistics operations with artificial intelligence during the port transformation into a smart port. The research integrates capabilities-based resource analysis and dynamic capabilities with sociotechnicalimplementations of technologies and resilience approaches of complex systems under disruptions. The system applies robustdata infrastructures to propel analytical and AI modules that become effective once integrated with sufficient governance systems and trained personnel and operational processes to transform planning and safety and sustainability operations.It applies Scopus bibliometric research to analyze 123 articles using a systematic approach with both a search protocol and a document screening and duplication verification. It incorporates annual behavior and distribution of author and country performance analysis with science mapping techniques that explore keyword relation and co-citation and bibliographic coupling and conceptual structuring tools that construct thematic maps and multiple correspondence analysis with community detection while applying explicit thresholding and robust tests.The research connects AI applications to smart port domains through specific data-to-impact pathways while providing a method for bibliometric analysis that enables future updates. The research presents a step-by-step approach for data readiness followed by predictive and optimization implementation and organizational integration. The paper supports public policy through recommendations for data sharing standards and complete environmental benefit assessments. The research proposes a future study plan whichcombines field-based testing with multiple port assessments to enhance both cause-effect understanding and research applicability.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Bounded Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19737v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive decision-making relies on strategic reasoning. Two prominent frameworks capture this idea. One follows a structural perspective, exemplified by level-$k$ and Cognitive Hierarchy models, which represent reasoning as an algorithmic process. The other adopts an epistemic perspective, formalizing reasoning through beliefs and higher-order beliefs. We connect these approaches by "lifting" static complete-information games into incomplete-information settings where payoff types reflect players' levels. Within this unified framework, reasoning is represented through mathematically explicit and transparent belief restrictions. We analyze three instances: downward rationalizability, a robust benchmark concept; and two refinements, L-rationalizability and CH-rationalizability, which provide epistemic foundations -- albeit with a nuance -- for the classic level-$k$ and Cognitive Hierarchy models, respectively. Our results clarify how reasoning depth relates to behavioral predictions, distinguish cognitive limits from belief restrictions, and connect bounded reasoning to robustness principles from mechanism design. The framework thus offers a transparent and tractable bridge between structural and epistemic approaches to reasoning in games.</description>

      <title>Rational Bubbles on Dividend-Paying Assets: A Comment on Tirole (1985)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tirole (1985) studied an overlapping generations model with capital accumulation and showed that the emergence of asset bubbles solves the capital over-accumulation problem. His Proposition 1(c) claims that if the dividend growth rate is above the bubbleless interest rate (the steady-state interest rate in the economy without the asset) but below the population growth rate, then bubbles are necessary in the sense that there exists no bubbleless equilibrium but there exists a unique bubbly equilibrium. We show that this result (as stated) is incorrect by presenting an example economy that satisfies all assumptions of Proposition 1(c) but its unique equilibrium is bubbleless. We also restore Proposition 1(c) under the additional assumptions that initial capital is sufficiently large and dividends are sufficiently small. We show through examples that these conditions are essential.</description>

      <title>From signaling to interviews in random matching markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many two-sided labor markets, interviews are conducted before matches are formed. The growing number of interviews in medical residency markets has increased demand for signaling mechanisms, where applicants send a limited number of signals to communicate interest. We study the role of signaling mechanisms to reduce interviews in centralized random matching markets where initial preferences are refined through interviews. Agents can only match with those they interview. For the market to clear, we focus on perfect interim stability: no pair of agents-even if they never interviewed each other-prefers each other to their assigned partners under their interim preferences. A matching is almost interim stable if it is perfect interim stable after removing a vanishingly small fraction of agents.
  We analyze signaling mechanisms in random matching markets with $n$ agents where agents on the short side, long side, or both sides signal their top $d$ preferred partners. The interview graph connects pairs where at least one party signaled the other. We reveal a fundamental trade-off between almost and perfect interim stability. For almost interim stability, $d=\omega(1)$ signals suffice: short-side signaling is always effective, whereas long-side signaling is effective only when the market is weakly imbalanced, i.e., when any size difference between the two sides becomes negligible as the market grows. For perfect interim stability, at least $d=\Omega(\log^2 n)$ signals are necessary, and short-side signaling becomes crucial in any imbalanced market. We establish that truthful signaling is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium and extend our analysis to markets with hierarchical structure. As a technical contribution, we develop a message-passing algorithm that efficiently determines interim stability by leveraging local neighborhood structures.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>
