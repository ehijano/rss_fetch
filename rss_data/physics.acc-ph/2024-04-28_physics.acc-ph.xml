      <title>High-repetition-rate seeded free-electron laser with direct-amplification of an external coherent laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.11971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various scientific and industrial researches such as spectroscopy and advanced nano-technologies have been demanding high flux and fully coherent EUV and X-ray radiation. These demands can be commendably satisfied with a MHz-level repetition-rate seeded free-electron laser (FEL). Dictated by the seed laser system, seeded FELs have faced obstacles for the realization of MHz repetition rate. Reducing the required peak power of an external coherent seed laser can effectively increase the repetition rate of a seeded FEL. This paper presents a novel technique that employs a long modulator as a carrier for laser amplification and electron modulation, which is quite different from nominal seeded FELs. Applications of the proposed technique into high-gain harmonic generation (HGHG) and echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) are investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that seed laser power is reduced by about three orders of magnitude and the FEL radiation possesses consistently high coherence and power stability with respect to the nominal HGHG or EEHG. The proposed technique paves the way for the realization of fully coherent EUV and soft X-ray FELs with a repetition rate of MHz and an average power of about 100 W.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high harmonic conversion of a seeded free-electron laser via harmonic optical klystron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: External seeded free-electron lasers (FELs) are compelling tools for generating fully coherent EUV and soft X-ray radiations. Echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG), the most typical representative of external seeded FELs, has witnessed a remarkable growth of fully coherent FELs in the last decade, continuously evolving towards higher harmonic conversions and shorter wavelengths. Ultra-high harmonic generation is imperative in the field of FELs. This paper presents a novel method for generating FEL radiation with ultra-high harmonic conversion, utilizing harmonic optical klystron in combination with EEHG. This method can effectively increase the harmonic conversion order to about 90. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that intense and almost fully coherent FEL pulses can be generated with a wavelength of 3 nm. At the same time, the seed laser intensity required by this scheme is lower compared to nominal EEHG, thus facilitating the generation of high-repetition-rate seeded FELs.</description>
