      <title>Impact of Storm Surge and Power Peaking on Tidal-Fluvial Dynamics in Microtidal Neretva River Estuary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the interactions between tides, storm surge, river flow, and power peaking in the microtidal Neretva River estuary, Croatia. Based on the existing NS_Tide tool, the study proposes a new non-stationary harmonic model adapted for microtidal conditions, which incorporates linear storm surge, as well as linear and quadratic river discharge terms. This model enhances the NS_Tide's ability to accurately predict water levels from tide-dominated sections downstream to discharge-dominated areas upstream. River discharge was identified as the dominant factor for predicting stage levels at most stations, while the influence of storm surge, though consistent, decreased upstream. Strong tide-river interactions were observed throughout the study domain, with the stationary tidal component consistently contributing to water level fluctuations at all locations, and minimal influence from the tide-surge interaction component. Simulations using the STREAM numerical model were also used to isolate the variability in water levels caused by power peaking. These simulations demonstrated that high-frequency discharge fluctuations due to hydropower plant operations amplify the $S_1$ constituent in upstream river sections and modulate the amplitudes of other tidal constituents in the estuarine and tidal river sections. The proposed method proved highly effective in the microtidal context of the Neretva River and shows potential for adaptation to mesotidal and macrotidal systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Heatwave Forecasting via Distribution Informed-Graph Neural Networks (DI-GNNs): Integrating Extreme Value Theory with GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heatwaves, prolonged periods of extreme heat, have intensified in frequency and severity due to climate change, posing substantial risks to public health, ecosystems, and infrastructure. Despite advancements in Machine Learning (ML) modeling, accurate heatwave forecasting at weather scales (1--15 days) remains challenging due to the non-linear interactions between atmospheric drivers and the rarity of these extreme events. Traditional models relying on heuristic feature engineering often fail to generalize across diverse climates and capture the complexities of heatwave dynamics. This study introduces the Distribution-Informed Graph Neural Network (DI-GNN), a novel framework that integrates principles from Extreme Value Theory (EVT) into the graph neural network architecture. DI-GNN incorporates Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD)-derived descriptors into the feature space, adjacency matrix, and loss function to enhance its sensitivity to rare heatwave occurrences. By prioritizing the tails of climatic distributions, DI-GNN addresses the limitations of existing methods, particularly in imbalanced datasets where traditional metrics like accuracy are misleading. Empirical evaluations using weather station data from British Columbia, Canada, demonstrate the superior performance of DI-GNN compared to baseline models. DI-GNN achieved significant improvements in balanced accuracy, recall, and precision, with high AUC and average precision scores, reflecting its robustness in distinguishing heatwave events.</description>

      <title>Regional Ocean Forecasting with Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting systems are vital for understanding marine dynamics, which play a crucial role in environmental management and climate adaptation strategies. Traditional numerical solvers, while effective, are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements in machine learning have revolutionized weather forecasting, offering fast and energy-efficient alternatives. Building on these advancements, we introduce SeaCast, a neural network designed for high-resolution, medium-range ocean forecasting. SeaCast employs a graph-based framework to effectively handle the complex geometry of ocean grids and integrates external forcing data tailored to the regional ocean context. Our approach is validated through experiments at a high spatial resolution using the operational numerical model of the Mediterranean Sea provided by the Copernicus Marine Service, along with both numerical and data-driven atmospheric forcings.</description>

      <title>FengWu-W2S: A deep learning model for seamless weather-to-subseasonal forecast of global atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seamless forecasting that produces warning information at continuum timescales based on only one system is a long-standing pursuit for weather-climate service. While the rapid advancement of deep learning has induced revolutionary changes in classical forecasting field, current efforts are still focused on building separate AI models for weather and climate forecasts. To explore the seamless forecasting ability based on one AI model, we propose FengWu-Weather to Subseasonal (FengWu-W2S), which builds on the FengWu global weather forecast model and incorporates an ocean-atmosphere-land coupling structure along with a diverse perturbation strategy. FengWu-W2S can generate 6-hourly atmosphere forecasts extending up to 42 days through an autoregressive and seamless manner. Our hindcast results demonstrate that FengWu-W2S reliably predicts atmospheric conditions out to 3-6 weeks ahead, enhancing predictive capabilities for global surface air temperature, precipitation, geopotential height and intraseasonal signals such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Moreover, our ablation experiments on forecast error growth from daily to seasonal timescales reveal potential pathways for developing AI-based integrated system for seamless weather-climate forecasting in the future.</description>
