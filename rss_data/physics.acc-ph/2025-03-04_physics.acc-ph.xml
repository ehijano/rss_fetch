      <title>Simulating Negative Hydrogen ion acceleration in LINAC-4 using Unity 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Linear Accelerator 4 (LINAC 4) is designed to accelerate negative hydrogen ions to high energies for injection into the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where it has been supplying proton beams since 2020. LINAC 4 accelerates negative hydrogen ions to 160 MeV. The accelerator pulses 400 microsecond bursts of negative hydrogen ions. A complex process is processed in this machine to achieve the required energy and simulating the machine is beneficial for improved understanding, visualization, educational purposes, and for training and skill development. Normally, high performance, specialized software is needed to simulate the intricate dynamics of ion acceleration. However, our goal is to develop an interactive, realtime model that effectively simulates the acceleration of negative H ions through the LINAC 4 stages by utilizing simulation and visualization capabilities of Unity 3D. In this study, Electric fields generated by each unit of LINAC 4 are assumed as known wave functions, and instantaneous velocity is calculated using fundamental physics laws. 3D structures were developed to approximate scale, and the user can control the frequency of the electric field to adjust the velocity, allowing the particle to reach the required energy level at the end. A time based pattern is used in the Chopper line, where the user can change the beam on time. Users can visualize the particle beam path and approximated graphical representation of the velocity variation in LINAC 4 under controllable electric fields and different time based chopping patterns generated by the chopper line. This simulation creates an accessible platform for students, researchers, and technicians to learn about processes of LINAC 4 in an interactive manner. It also guides users to better understand complex acceleration physics by allowing them to visualize the ion pathways, energy changes, and field interactions.</description>

      <title>Zeptosecond Gamma-Ray Pulses Generation via FEL-Driven Microbunching and Laser-Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel and reliable approach to generate zeptosecond(10^{-21} s,zs), high-energy photon pulse bursts by synergistically exploiting the inherent characteristics of Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) and laser-Compton scattering. The feasibility of this scheme is validated through comprehensive numerical simulations. In a representative simulation, a 4 GeV electron beam, undergoing the FEL process, emits radiation at 0.7 nm and develops a microbunched structure. These microbunches subsequently interact with a 2 ps, 9 micrometers laser pulse in a head-on Compton scattering configuration. Our simulation results demonstrate that under conditions of well-established electron beam microbunching, the proposed method successfully yields high-brightness gamma-photon pulse bursts with durations approaching 800 zeptoseconds and exhibiting exceptional signal-to-noise ratios, consistent with theoretical expectations. This technique opens up avenues for exploring ultrafast nuclear dynamics and provides unprecedented perspectives for delving into the Quantum Zeno and Anti-Zeno effects.</description>

      <title>First direct observation of a wakefield generated with structured light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of structured light to control the phase velocity of the wake in laser-wakefield accelerators has generated significant interest for its ability to mitigate electron dephasing. Combining the diffraction-free properties of Bessel beams with spatio-temporal shaping of the pulse promises to enable acceleration with an unprecedented combination of long acceleration lengths and high gradients. This would facilitate the acceleration of electrons to energies above 100 GeV in existing laser facilities. In-depth understanding of the physical mechanisms involved is critical to achieving dephasing-free electron acceleration. Here we present the first experimental observation of wakefields generated by beams that were spatio-temporally sculpted and then focused with a long-focal-depth mirror, known as an axiparabola, which generates a quasi-Bessel beam. The resulting wakefield was imaged using femtosecond relativistic electron microscopy. Novel insights into this minimally explored regime include mapping the wakefield development over the focal depth and studying the effects of spatio-temporal manipulations of the beam on the structure and phase velocity of the wakefield. Such insights pave the way towards realizing the potential of structured-light based solutions to dephasing in laser-wakefield acceleration.</description>

      <title>On the influence of electron velocity spread on Compton FEL operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the field amplitude, a nonlinear integro-differential equation is derived that describes the operation of a Compton FEL in the presence of electron velocity spread typical for modern facilities. Numerical solutions of the equation are in good agreement with particle simulations for the bunching factor &lt;0.6, reproduce the frequency detuning spectrum near its maximum, and describe the amplification process up to saturation.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies of a high-repetition-rate electron-driven surface muon beamline at SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-repetition-rate pulsed muon source operating at approximately 50\,kHz holds the potential to significantly enhance the sensitivity of various particle physics and material science experiments involving muons. In this article, we propose utilizing the high-repetition-rate pulsed electron beam at the SHINE facility to generate a surface muon beam. Our simulation studies indicate that an 8\,GeV, 100\,pC charge pulsed electron beam impinging on a copper target can produce up to $2 \times 10^{3}$ muons per pulse. Beamline optimization results demonstrate that approximately 60 surface muons per electron bunch can be efficiently transported to the end of the beamline. This translates to a surface muon rate of $3 \times 10^{6}\mu^{+}$/s when the pulsed electron beam is operated at 50\,kHz, which is comparable to existing muon facilities. This high-repetition-rate pulsed muon beam, with its ideal time structure, represents a unique and pioneering effort once constructed. It serves as a model for building cost-effective muon sources at existing electron machines with GeV electron energies. The main challenge of positron removal is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of beam injection and storage in the PSI muEDM Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The muEDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute aims to measure the electric dipole moment with an unprecedented sensitivity of $6 \times 10^{-23}\,\mathrm{e}\cdot\mathrm{cm}$. A key aspect of this experiment is the injection and storage of the muon beam, which traverses a long, narrow superconducting channel before entering a solenoid magnet. The muon is then kicked by a pulsed magnetic field into a stable orbit within the solenoid's central region, where the electric dipole moment is measured. To study the beam injection and storage process, we developed a G4beamline simulation to model the dynamics of beam injection and storage, incorporating all relevant electric and magnetic fields. We subsequently employed a Bayesian optimization technique to improve the muon storage efficiency for Phase I of the muEDM experiment. The optimization is demonstrated using data simulated by G4beamline. We have observed an enhancement in the beam injection and storage efficiency, which increased to 0.556\% through the utilization of Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, compared to 0.324\% when employing the polynomial chaos expansion. This approach can be applied to adjust actual experimental parameters, aiding in achieving the desired performance for beam injection and storage in the muEDM experiment.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal shaping of plasma waveguides using diffractive axicons for laser wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New techniques for the optical generation of plasma waveguides -- optical fibres for ultra-intense light pulses -- have become vital to the advancement of multi-GeV laser wakefield acceleration. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of a transmissive eight-level logarithmic diffractive axicon (LDA) for the generation of meter-scale plasma waveguides. These LDAs enable the formation of a Bessel-like beam with controllable start and end locations of the focal line and near-constant intensity on axis. We present measurements of the Bessel-like focal profile produced by the LDA, and of the leading end of the plasma column generated by it. One important feature is the formation of a funnel-mouthed plasma channel entrance that can act as waveguide coupler. We also compare the diffraction efficiency of our 8-level LDA to 4-level and binary versions, with measurements comparing well to theory.</description>

      <title>Application of autoresonance in rapid beam extraction of synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a novel cancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy as conventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues. However, due to the limitation of particle number, achieving FLASH condition in a compact heavy-ion synchrotron requires a short extraction time of tens of milliseconds, which is challenging for the conventional RF-KO method. To tackle this challenge, we introduce autoresonance into the third-order resonant extraction for the first time, offering an alternative to the conventional approach of merely increasing the excitation strength. By leveraging a strong detuning effect, a frequency sweeping excitation with small amplitude can drive the entire beam into the autoresonant state, thus enabling rapid beam extraction within a single sweeping period. Compared with the conventional method, this innovative method requires only the addition of an octupole magnet. At the same time, it shows that the conventional RF-KO method has a high autoresonance threshold, so that only a small number of particles that meet the threshold can be excited to large amplitude and be extracted in each sweeping period. In this paper, the autoresonance threshold of a particle in the presence of sextupole and octupole magnetic fields is analyzed, and the single particle simulation shows good agreement with the theoretical formula. Furthermore, the autoresonance based rapid extraction process is simulated and studied, revealing the possibility of millisecond scale beam extraction.</description>

      <title>Explainable physics-based constraints on reinforcement learning for accelerator controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for controlling particle accelerator experiments that builds explainable physics-based constraints on agent behavior. The goal is to increase transparency and trust by letting users verify that the agent's decision-making process incorporates suitable physics. Our algorithm uses a learnable surrogate function for physical observables, such as energy, and uses them to fine-tune how actions are chosen. This surrogate can be represented by a neural network or by an interpretable sparse dictionary model. We test our algorithm on a range of particle accelerator controls environments designed to emulate the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab. By examining the mathematical form of the learned constraint function, we are able to confirm the agent has learned to use the established physics of each environment. In addition, we find that the introduction of a physics-based surrogate enables our reinforcement learning algorithms to reliably converge for difficult high-dimensional accelerator controls environments.</description>
