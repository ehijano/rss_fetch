      <title>Modeling Cascading Driver Interventions in Partially Automated Traffic: A Semi-Markov Chain Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical modeling framework for partially automated traffic, incorporating cascading driver intervention behaviors. In this framework, drivers of partially automated vehicles have the flexibility to switch driving modes (either AV or HDV) under lockout constraints. The cascading impact is captured by making the switching probability leader-dependent, highlighting the influence of the leading vehicle on mode choice and the potential propagation of mode changes throughout traffic. Due to the complexity of this system, traditional Markov-based methods are insufficient. To address this, the paper introduces an innovative semi-Markov chain framework with lockout constraints, ideally suited for modeling the system dynamics. This framework reformulates the system as a nonlinear model whose solution can be efficiently approximated using numerical methods from control theory, such as the Runge-Kutta algorithm. Moreover, the system is proven to be a piecewise affine bilinear system, with the existence of solutions and both local and global stability established via Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem and the 1D Uncertainty Polytopes Theorem. Numerical experiments corroborate these theoretical findings, confirming the presence of cascading impacts and elucidating the influence of modeling parameters on traffic throughput, thereby deepening our understanding of the system's properties.</description>

      <title>Lelek-like Fans: Endpoint-dense Continua Supporting Topologically Mixing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lelek fan is the only smooth fan that has a dense set of end-points. In this paper, we study non-smooth fans with this property; i.e., we construct an uncountable family of pairwise non-homeomorphic such fans. Furthermore, we prove that each of them admits a topologically mixing non-invertible mapping as well as a topologically mixing homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Unique steady states for population models in a heterogeneous environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a model proposed by Freedman etal in \cite{freedman} which describes the dynamics of a population diffusing in a patchy environment. From their work it is known that positive steady states exist for this model, but not whether they are unique. Here, we provide sufficient conditions guaranteeing that steady states are unique. These conditions are satisfied when the reaction rates are generalized logistic growth rates. Our proofs critically exploit Chicone's ideas in \cite{chicone}, which were used to establish that the period map associated to a continuous family of periodic solutions of certain planar Hamiltonian systems is monotone.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamics of interfaces for nonlinear SPDEs driven by multiplicative white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we investigate the dynamics of the infinite-dimensional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) with multiplicative white noise. We derive the effective equation on the approximate slow manifold in detail by utilizing a finite-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) describing the motion of interfaces. In particular, we verify the equivalence between the full SPDE and the coupled system under small stochastic perturbations. Moreover, we apply our results to effective dynamics of stochastic models with multiplicative white noise, illustrated with four examples on the stochastic damped wave equation, the stochastic Allen-Cahn equation, the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the stochastic Swift-Hohenberg equation.</description>

      <title>New solutions for the symmetrical n-body problem through variational approach and optimisation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in the variational approach to the $n$-body problem have led to significant progress in celestial mechanics, uncovering new types of possible orbits. In this paper, critical points of the Lagrangian action associated with the $n$-body problem are analysed using evolutionary algorithms to identify periodic and symmetrical solutions of the discretised system. A key objective is to locate minimum points of the action functional, as these correspond to feasible periodic solutions that satisfy the system's differential equations. By employing both stochastic and deterministic algorithms, we explore the solution space and obtain numerical representations of these orbits.
  Next, we examine the stability of these orbits by treating them as critical points. One approach is to compute their discrete Morse index to distinguish between minimum points and saddle points. Another is to classify them based on their action levels. Finally, analysing the boundaries of their attraction basins allows us to identify non-minimal critical points via the Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz Mountain Pass Theorem. This leads to an updated version of the algorithm that provides a constructive proof of the theorem, yielding new orbits in specific cases.
  This paper builds upon and extends the results presented in \cite{nostro}, providing a more detailed theoretical framework and deeper insights into the formulation. Additionally, we present new numerical results and an extended analysis of the critical points found, further enhancing the findings of the previous study.</description>

Abstract: We compute the almost sure Hausdorff dimension of random self-affine sponges in $\mathbb{R}^d$ without imposing any separation conditions. In this context, randomness arises from the matrices in the defining semigroup, which are random yet the corresponding affine maps share a fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random dynamical systems composed of LSV maps with varying parameters, without any mixing assumptions on the base space of random dynamics. We establish a quenched central limit theorem and identify conditions under which the associated limit variance varies continuously and differentiably with respect to perturbations of the random dynamics. Our arguments rely on recent results on statistical stability and linear response for random intermittent maps established in Dragicevic et al. (J. Lond. Math. Soc. 111 (2025), e70150).</description>

      <title>Ergodic and Entropic Behavior of the Harmonic Map Heat Flow to the Moduli Space of Flat Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the harmonic map heat flow from a compact Riemannian manifold \( M \) into the moduli space \( \mathcal{M}_1 \) of unit-area flat tori, which carries a natural hyperbolic structure as the quotient \( \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}) \backslash \mathbb{H} \). We prove that the flow is stable with respect to the energy functional and exhibits ergodic behavior in the sense that the evolving maps asymptotically distribute their image uniformly across the moduli space. As a concrete contribution, we show that the sequence of pushforward measures under the flow converges weak--$^{*}$ to the normalized hyperbolic measure on \( \mathcal{M}_1 \). Moreover, we introduce a relative entropy framework to measure the statistical deviation of the flow from equilibrium and prove that the relative entropy with respect to the hyperbolic measure decays to zero in the long-time limit. This provides a quantitative refinement of the ergodic result and establishes a connection between geometric flows, moduli space dynamics, and information-theoretic convergence.</description>

      <title>Extended states for the Random Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ ($d\geq 5$) with decaying Bernoulli potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the delocalization property of the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H_\omega=-\Delta+v_n\omega_n\delta_{n,n'}$, where $v_n=\kappa |n|^{-\alpha}$ and $\omega=\{\omega_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d}\in \{\pm 1\}^{\mathbb{Z}^d}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. Under the assumptions of $d\geq 5$, $\alpha&gt;\frac14$ and $0&lt;\kappa\ll1$, we construct the extended states for a deterministic renormalization of $H_\omega$ for most $\omega$. This extends the work of Bourgain [{\it Geometric Aspects of Functional Analysis}, LNM 1807: 70--98, 2003], where the case $\alpha&gt;\frac13$ was handled. Our proof is based on Green's function estimates via a $6$th-order renormalization scheme. Among the main new ingredients are the proof of a generalized Khintchine inequality via Bonami's lemma, and the application of the fractional Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality to control a new type of non-random operators arising from the $6$th-order renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a holomorphic automorphism of a compact K\"ahler manifold with simple action on cohomology and $\mu$ its unique measure of maximal entropy. We prove that $\mu$ is exponentially mixing of all orders for all d.s.h.\ observables, i.e., functions that are locally differences of plurisubharmonic functions. As a consequence, every d.s.h.\ observable satisfies the central limit theorem with respect to $\mu$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have studied the long-term behavior for the projected deterministic constrained modified Swift-Hohenberg equation with constraints and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Specifically, using Lojasiewicz-Simon inequality, we have shown that the global solution approaches an equilibrium state. Also, we have analyzed the rate at which the solution approaches equilibrium. Finally, we have proven the existence of a global attractor.</description>

Abstract: We derive an explicit tree based ansatz for the Birkhoff normal form up to any order in the context of Hamiltonian PDEs.

      <title>The Zimmer Program for partially hyperbolic actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.08195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zimmer's superrigidity theorems on higher rank Lie groups and their lattices launched a program of study aiming to classify actions of semisimple Lie groups and their lattices, known as the {\it Zimmer program}. When the group is too large relative to the dimension of the phase space, the Zimmer conjecture predicts that the actions are all virtually trivial. At the other extreme, when the actions exhibit enough regular behavior, the actions should all be of algebraic origin.
  We make progress in the program by showing smooth conjugacy to a bi-homogeneous model (up to a finite cover) for volume-preserving actions of semisimple Lie groups without compact or rank one factors, which have two key assumptions: partial hyperbolicity for a large class of elements ({\it totally partial hyperbolicity}) and accessibility, a condition on the webs generated by dynamically-defined foliations. We also obtain classification for actions of higher-rank abelian groups satisfying stronger assumptions.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we develop an innovative functional-analytic framework to establish existence, uniqueness, regularity of disintegration, and statistical properties of equilibrium states for a broad class of dynamical systems, potentially discontinuous and not necessarily locally invertible. Our approach is applied to a family of piecewise partially hyperbolic maps and associated classes of potentials. We further prove several statistical limit theorems, including exponential decay of correlations, and propose related questions and conjectures. A collection of examples illustrating the applicability of our results is provided, including partially hyperbolic attractors over horseshoes, discontinuous systems, non-invertible dynamics semi-conjugated to maps such as the Manneville-Pomeau map, and fat solenoidal attractors.</description>

      <title>Thurston obstructions and tropical geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an application of tropical moduli spaces to complex dynamics. A post-critically finite branched covering $\varphi$ of $S^2$ induces a pullback map on the Teichm\"uller space of complex structures of $S^2$; this descends to an algebraic correspondence on the moduli space of point-configurations of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^1$. We make a case for studying the action of the tropical moduli space correspondence by making explicit the connections between objects that have come up in one guise in tropical geometry and in another guise in complex dynamics. For example, a Thurston obstruction for $\varphi$ corresponds to a ray that is fixed by the tropical moduli space correspndence, and scaled by a factor $\ge 1$. This article is intended to be accessible to algebraic and tropical geometers as well as to complex dynamicists.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1902.06277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a thermodynamical approach to the study of distribution of modular symbols, motivated by the work of Baladi-Vall\'ee. We introduce the modular partitions of continued fractions and observe that the statistics for modular symbols follow from the behavior of modular partitions. We prove the limit Gaussian distribution and residual equidistribution for modular partitions as a vector-valued random variable on the set of rationals whose denominators are up to a fixed positive integer by studying the spectral properties of transfer operator associated to the underlying dynamics. The approach leads to a few applications. We show an average version of conjectures of Mazur-Rubin on statistics for the period integrals of an elliptic newform. We further observe that the equidistribution of mod $p$ values of modular symbols leads to mod $p$ non-vanishing results for special modular $L$-values twisted by a Dirichlet character.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator presents an attractive approach to achieve global linearization of nonlinear systems, making it a valuable method for simplifying the understanding of complex dynamics. While data-driven methodologies have exhibited promise in approximating finite Koopman operators, they grapple with various challenges, such as the judicious selection of observables, dimensionality reduction, and the ability to predict complex system behaviours accurately. This study presents a novel approach termed Mori-Zwanzig autoencoder (MZ-AE) to robustly approximate the Koopman operator in low-dimensional spaces. The proposed method leverages a nonlinear autoencoder to extract key observables for approximating a finite invariant Koopman subspace and integrates a non-Markovian correction mechanism using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. Consequently, this approach yields an approximate closure of the dynamics within the latent manifold of the nonlinear autoencoder, thereby enhancing the accuracy and stability of the Koopman operator approximation. Demonstrations showcase the technique's improved predictive capability for flow around a cylinder. It also provides a low dimensional approximation for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) with promising short-term predictability and robust long-term statistical performance. By bridging the gap between data-driven techniques and the mathematical foundations of Koopman theory, MZ-AE offers a promising avenue for improved understanding and prediction of complex nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Oscillations in Cournot Games with Best Response Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model, which involves multiple firms producing homogeneous products. To explore the oscillation under the updates of best response strategies, we focus on the linear price functions. In this setting, we establish the existence of oscillations. In particular, we show that for the scenario of different costs among firms, the best response converges to either a unique equilibrium or a two-period oscillation. We further characterize the oscillations and propose linear-time algorithms for finding all types of two-period oscillations. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first step toward fully analyzing the periodic oscillation in the Cournot oligopoly model.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow structure for some nonlocal diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study ``nonlocal diffusion equations'' of the form \[ \partial_{t}\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)+\int_{X}\left(\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(x)-\frac{d\rho_{t}}{d\pi}(y)\right)\eta(x,y)d\pi(y)=0\qquad(\dagger) \] where $X$ is either $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ or $\mathbb{T}^{d}$, $\pi$ is a probability distribution on $X$, and $\eta(x,y)$ is a ``transition kernel'' which may be singular as $x\rightarrow y$. For a suitable notion of weak solutions which we discuss below, we show that solutions to these nonlocal diffusion equations can be interpreted as gradient flows of the relative entropy with respect to a certain nonlocal Wasserstein-type metric defined in terms of $\eta$ and $\pi$. These ``nonlocal Wasserstein metrics'' endow the space of probability measures on $X$ with a formal Riemannian structure, thereby providing for us a nonlocal analogue of the \emph{Otto calculus} originally developed in the context of the 2-Wasserstein metric. The class of equations $(\dagger)$ includes a family of ``nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations'', which are thus identified as nonlocal Wasserstein gradient flows of the relative entropy, analogously with the usual Fokker-Planck equation and the $W_{2}$ metric.
  The gradient flow structure we provide allows us to deduce: existence and uniqueness of solutions to ($\dagger$) in a suitable class of weak solutions; stability of solutions in the sense of evolutionary $\Gamma$-convergence, with respect to perturbations of initial condition, reference measure $\pi$, and transition kernel $\eta$; sufficient conditions for exponential convergence to equilibrium, in terms of a nonlocal analogue of the log-Sobolev inequality; as well as the consistency of a finite-volume-type spatial discretization scheme in the $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ case.</description>

      <title>An Approximate-Master-Equation Formulation of the Watts Threshold Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04020</link>

Abstract: In traditional models of behavioral or opinion dynamics on social networks, researchers suppose that all interactions occur between pairs of individuals. However, in reality, social interactions also occur in groups of three or more individuals. A common way to incorporate such polyadic interactions is to study dynamical processes on hypergraphs. In a hypergraph, interactions can occur between any number of the individuals in a network. The Watts threshold model (WTM) is a well-known model of a simplistic social spreading process. Very recently, Chen et al. extended the WTM from dyadic networks (i.e., graphs) to polyadic networks (i.e., hypergraphs). In the present paper, we extend their discrete-time model to continuous time using approximate master equations (AMEs). By using AMEs, we are able to model the system with very high accuracy. We then reduce the high-dimensional AME system to a system of three coupled differential equations without any detectable loss of accuracy. This much lower-dimensional system is more computationally efficient to solve numerically and is also easier to interpret. We linearize the reduced AME system and calculate a cascade condition, which allows us to determine when a large spreading event occurs. We then apply our model to a social contact network of a French primary school and to a hypergraph of computer-science coauthorships. We find that the AME system is accurate in modelling the polyadic WTM on these empirical networks; however, we expect that future work that incorporates structural correlations between nearby nodes and groups into the model for the dynamics will lead to more accurate theory for real-world networks.</description>
