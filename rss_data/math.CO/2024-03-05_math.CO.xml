      <title>Uniform Recurrence in the Motzkin Numbers and Related Sequences mod $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many famous integer sequences including the Catalan numbers and the Motzkin numbers can be expressed in the form $ConstantTermOf\left[P(x)^nQ(x)\right]$ for Laurent polynomials $Q$, and symmetric Laurent trinomials $P$. In this paper we characterize the primes for which sequences of this form are uniformly recurrent modulo $p$. For all other primes, we show that $0$ has density $1$. This will be accomplished by showing that the study of these sequences mod $p$ can be reduced to the study of the generalized central trinomial coefficients, which are well-behaved mod $p$.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of generalized quadrangles admitting a point-primitive and line-primitive automorphism group with socle ${\rm PSU}(3,q)$, $q\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in the study of generalized quadrangles is to classify finite generalized quadrangles satisfying certain symmetry conditions. It is known that an automorphism group of a finite thick generalized quadrangle $\mathcal{S}$ acting primitively on both the points and lines of $\mathcal{S}$ must be almost simple. In this paper, we initiate the study of finite generalized quadrangles admitting a point-primitive and line-primitive automorphism group with socle being a unitary group. We develop a group-theoretic tool to prove that the socle of such a group cannot be ${\rm PSU}(3,q)$ with $q\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Tropical twisted Hurwitz numbers for elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hurwitz numbers enumerate branched morphisms between Riemann surfaces. For a fixed elliptic target, Hurwitz numbers are intimately related to mirror symmetry following work of Dijkgraaf. In recent work of Chapuy and Dolega a new variant of Hurwitz numbers with fixed genus $0$ target was introduced that includes maps between between non-orientiable surfaces. These numbers are called $b$-Hurwitz numbers and are polynomials in a parameter $b$ which measures the non-orientability of the involved maps. An interpretation in terms of factorisations of $b$-Hurwitz numbers for $b=1$, so-called twisted Hurwitz numbers, was found in work of Burman and Fesler. In previous work, the authors derived a tropical geometry interpretation of these numbers. In this paper, we introduce a natural generalisation of twisted Hurwitz numbers with elliptic targets within the framework of symmetric groups. We derive a tropical interpretation of these invariants, relate them to Feynman integrals and derive an expression as a matrix element of an operator in the bosonic Fock space.</description>

      <title>A group action on cyclic compositions and $\gamma$-positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $w_{n,k,m}$ be the number of Dyck paths of semilength $n$ with $k$ occurrences of $UD$ and $m$ occurrences of $UUD$. We establish in two ways a new interpretation of the numbers $w_{n,k,m}$ in terms of plane trees and internal nodes. The first way builds on a new characterization of plane trees that involves cyclic compositions. The second proof utilizes a known interpretation of $w_{n,k,m}$ in terms of plane trees and leaves, and a recent involution on plane trees constructed by Li, Lin, and Zhao. Moreover, a group action on the set of cyclic compositions (or equivalently, $2$-dominant compositions) is introduced, which amounts to give a combinatorial proof of the $\gamma$-positivity of the Narayana polynomial, as well as the $\gamma$-positivity of the polynomial $W_{2k+1,k}(t):=\sum_{1\le m\le k}w_{2k+1,k,m}t^m$ previously obtained by B\'{o}na et al, with apparently new combinatorial interpretations of their $\gamma$-coefficients.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of sets of points in the plane that satisfy distance conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph whose edges are labeled with general real numbers, we consider the set of functions from the vertex set into the Euclidean plane such that the distance between the images of neighbouring vertices is equal to the corresponding edge label. This set of functions can be expressed as the zero set of quadratic polynomials and our main result characterizes the number of complex irreducible components of this zero set in terms of combinatorial properties of the graph. In case the complex components are three-dimensional, then the graph is minimally rigid and the component number is a well-known invariant from rigidity theory. If the components are four-dimensional, then they correspond to one-dimensional coupler curves of flexible planar mechanisms. As an application, we characterize the degree of irreducible components of such coupler curves combinatorially.</description>

      <title>Improved Bounds for Point Selections and Halving Hyperplanes in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(P,E)$ be a $(d+1)$-uniform geometric hypergraph, where $P$ is an $n$-point set in general position in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $E\subseteq {P\choose d+1}$ is a collection of $\epsilon{n\choose d+1}$ $d$-dimensional simplices with vertices in $P$, for $0&lt;\epsilon\leq 1$. We show that there is a point $x\in {\mathbb R}^d$ that pierces $\displaystyle \Omega\left(\epsilon^{(d^4+d)(d+1)+\delta}{n\choose d+1}\right)$ simplices in $E$, for any fixed $\delta&gt;0$. This is a dramatic improvement in all dimensions $d\geq 3$, over the previous lower bounds of the general form $\displaystyle \epsilon^{(cd)^{d+1}}n^{d+1}$, which date back to the seminal 1991 work of Alon, B\'{a}r\'{a}ny, F\"{u}redi and Kleitman.
  As a result, any $n$-point set in general position in $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits only $\displaystyle O\left(n^{d-\frac{1}{d(d-1)^4+d(d-1)}+\delta}\right)$ halving hyperplanes, for any $\delta&gt;0$, which is a significant improvement over the previously best known bound $\displaystyle O\left(n^{d-\frac{1}{(2d)^{d}}}\right)$ in all dimensions $d\geq 5$.
  An essential ingredient of our proof is the following semi-algebraic Tur\'an-type result of independent interest: Let $(V_1,\ldots,V_k,E)$ be a hypergraph of bounded semi-algebraic description complexity in ${\mathbb R}^d$ that satisfies $|E|\geq \varepsilon |V_1|\cdot\ldots \cdot |V_k|$ for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Then there exist subsets $W_i\subseteq V_i$ that satisfy $W_1\times W_2\times\ldots\times W_k\subseteq E$, and $|W_1|\cdot\ldots\cdots|W_k|=\Omega\left(\varepsilon^{d(k-1)+1}|V_1|\cdot |V_2|\cdot\ldots\cdot|V_k|\right)$.</description>

      <title>Admissable sets do not exist for all parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cap set in $\mathbb{F}_3^n$ is a subset that contains no three elements adding to 0. Building on a construction of Edel, a recent paper of Tyrrell gave the first improvement to the lower bound for a size of a cap set in two decades showing that, for large enough $n$, there is always a cap set in $\mathbb{F}_3^n$ of size at least $2.218^n$. This was shown by constructing what is called an $I(11,7)$ admissible set.
  An admissible set is a subset of $\{0,1,2\}^m$ such that the supports of the vectors form an antichain with respect to inclusion and each triple of vectors has some coordinate where either exactly one of them is non-zero or exactly two are and they have different values. Such an admissible set is said to be $I(m,w)$ if it is of size $\binom mw$ and all of the vectors have exactly $w$ non-zero elements. In Tyrrell's paper they conjectured that $I(m,w)$ admissible set exists for all parameters. We resolve this conjecture by showing that there exists an $N$ such that an $I(N,4)$ admissible set does not exist.
  We refer to the type of a vector in $\{0,1,2\}^m$ is the ordered sequence of its non-zero coefficients. The vectors of type $12$ form an $I(m,2)$ admissible set and the vectors of type $121$ form an $I(m,3)$ admissible set (as can be easily checked by an interested reader). Sadly it is quite easily proved that there is no $I(6,4)$ admissible set where all vectors are of the same type. It follows by Ramsey's Theorem applied to 4-regular hypergraphs that there exists an $N$ such that an $I(N,4)$ admissible set does not exist.
  A similar argument shows that there exists an $N'$ such that an $I(N',N'-2)$ admissible set does not exist. Since we can construct an $I(m-1,w)$ and an $I(m-1,w-1)$ admissible set from an $I(m,w)$ admissible set, it follows that there are only finitely many $I(m,w)$ admissible sets exist other than the known forms.</description>

      <title>On two non-existence results for Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on non-existence results for Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets. A Cameron-Liebler $k$-set is a collection of $k$-spaces in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ or $\mathrm{AG}(n,q)$ admitting a certain parameter $x$, which is dependent on the size of this collection. One of the main research questions remains the (non-)existence of Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets with parameter $x$. This paper improves two non-existence results. First we show that the parameter of a non-trivial Cameron-Liebler $k$-set in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ should be larger than $q^{n-\frac{5k}{2}-1}$, which is an improvement of an earlier known lower bound. Secondly, we prove a modular equality on the parameter $x$ of Cameron-Liebler $k$-sets in $\mathrm{PG}(n,q)$ with $x&lt;\frac{q^{n-k}-1}{q^{k+1}-1}$, $n\geq 2k+1$, $n-k+1\geq 7$ and $n-k$ even. In the affine case we show a similar result for $n-k+1\geq 3$ and $n-k$ even. This is a generalization of earlier known modular equalities in the projective and affine case.</description>

      <title>Connected Domination in Plane Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of vertices of a graph $G$ such that each vertex of $G$ is either in the set or is adjacent to a vertex in the set is called a dominating set of $G$. If additionally, the set of vertices induces a connected subgraph of $G$ then the set is a connected dominating set of $G$. The domination number $\gamma(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest number of vertices in a dominating set of $G$, and the connected domination number $\gamma_c(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest number of vertices in a connected dominating set of $G$. We find the connected domination numbers for all triangulations of up to thirteen vertices. For $n\ge 15$, $n\equiv 0$ (mod 3), we find graphs of order $n$ and $\gamma_c=\frac{n}{3}$. We also show that the difference $\gamma_c(G)-\gamma(G)$ can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behavior for partitions separated by parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of partitions with parts separated by parity was initiated by Andrews in connection with Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and his variations on this theme have produced generating functions with a large variety of different modular properties. In this paper, we use Ingham's Tauberian theorem to compute the asymptotic main term for each of the eight functions studied by Andrews.</description>

      <title>On Hoffman polynomials of $\lambda$-doubly stochastic irreducible matrices and commutative association schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a finite (strongly) connected regular (di)graph with adjacency matrix $A$. The {\em Hoffman polynomial} $h(t)$ of $\Gamma=\Gamma(A)$ is the unique polynomial of smallest degree satisfying $h(A)=J$, where $J$ denotes the all-ones matrix. Let $X$ denote a nonempty finite set. A nonnegative matrix $B\in{\mbox{Mat}}_X({\mathbb R})$ is called {\em $\lambda$-doubly stochastic} if $\sum_{z\in X} (B)_{yz}=\sum_{z\in X} (B)_{zy}=\lambda$ for each $y\in X$. In this paper we first show that there exists a polynomial $h(t)$ such that $h(B)=J$ if and only if $B$ is a $\lambda$-doubly stochastic irreducible matrix. This result allows us to define the Hoffman polynomial of a $\lambda$-doubly stochastic irreducible matrix.
  Now, let $B\in{\mbox{Mat}}_X({\mathbb R})$ denote a normal irreducible nonnegative matrix, and ${\cal B}=\{p(B)\mid p\in{\mathbb{C}}[t]\}$ denote the vector space over ${\mathbb{C}}$ of all polynomials in $B$. Let us define a $01$-matrix $\widehat{A}$ in the following way: $(\widehat{A})_{xy}=1$ if and only if $(B)_{xy}&gt;0$ $(x,y\in X)$. Let $\Gamma=\Gamma(\widehat{A})$ denote a (di)graph with adjacency matrix $\widehat{A}$, diameter $D$, and let $A_D$ denote the distance-$D$ matrix of $\Gamma$. We show that ${\cal B}$ is the Bose--Mesner algebra of a commutative $D$-class association scheme if and only if $B$ is a normal $\lambda$-doubly stochastic matrix with $D+1$ distinct eigenvalues and $A_D$ is a polynomial in $B$.</description>

      <title>Edge open packing: complexity, algorithmic aspects, and bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, two edges $e_{1},e_{2}\in E(G)$ are said to have a common edge $e$ if $e$ joins an endvertex of $e_{1}$ to an endvertex of $e_{2}$. A subset $B\subseteq E(G)$ is an edge open packing set in $G$ if no two edges of $B$ have a common edge in $G$, and the maximum cardinality of such a set in $G$ is called the edge open packing number, $\rho_{e}^{o}(G)$, of $G$. In this paper, we prove that the decision version of the edge open packing number is NP-complete even when restricted to graphs with universal vertices, Eulerian bipartite graphs, and planar graphs with maximum degree $4$, respectively. In contrast, we present a linear-time algorithm that computes the edge open packing number of a tree. We also resolve two problems posed in the seminal paper [Edge open packing sets in graphs, RAIRO-Oper.\ Res.\ 56 (2022) 3765--3776]. Notably, we characterize the graphs $G$ that attain the upper bound $\rho_e^o(G)\le |E(G)|/\delta(G)$, and provide lower and upper bounds for the edge-deleted subgraph of a graph and establish the corresponding realization result.</description>

      <title>Manifolds realized as orbit spaces of non-free $\mathbb Z_2^k$-actions on real moment-angle manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ corresponding to a simple convex $n$ polytope $P$ with $m$ facets. The criterion when the orbit space $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a topological manifold (perhaps with a boundary) can be extracted from results by M.A. Mikhailova and C. Lange. For any dimension $n$ we construct series of manifolds $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ homeomorphic to $S^n$ and series of manifolds $M^n=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ admitting a hyperelliptic involution $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, that is an involution $\tau$ such that $M^n/\langle\tau\rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. For any $3$-polytope $P$ we classify all subgroups $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a $3$-sphere or a rational homology $3$-sphere. For any $3$-polytope $P$ and any subgroup $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ we classify all hyperelliptic involutions $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ acting on $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$. As a corollary we obtain that a $3$-dimensional small cover has $3$ hyperelliptic involutions in $\mathbb Z_2^3$ if and only if it is a rational homology $3$-sphere and if and only if it correspond to a triple of Hamiltonian cycles such that each edge of the polytope belongs to exactly two of them.</description>

      <title>The Honest Embedding Dimension of a Numerical Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attached to a singular analytic curve germ in $d$-space is a numerical semigroup: a subset $S$ of the non-negative integers which is closed under addition and whose complement isfinite. Conversely, associated to any numerical semigroup $S$ is a canonical mononial curve in $e$-space where $e$ is the number of minimal generators of the semigroup. It may happen that $d &lt; e = e(S)$ where $S$ is the semigroup of the curve in $d$-space. Define the minimal (or `honest') embedding of a numerical semigroup to be the smallest $d$ such that $S$ is realized by a curve in $d$-space. Problem: characterize the numerical semigroups having minimal embedding dimension $d$. The answer is known for the case $d=2$ of planar curves and reviewed in an Appendix to this paper. The case $d =3$ of the problem is open. Our main result is a characterization of the multiplicity $4$ numerical semigroups whose minimal embedding dimension is $3$. See figure 1. The motivation for this work came from thinking about Legendrian curve singularities.</description>

      <title>Extremal decompositions of tropical varieties and relations with rigidity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremality and irreducibility constitute fundamental concepts in mathematics, particularly within tropical geometry. While extremal decomposition is typically computationally hard, this article presents a fast algorithm for identifying the extremal decomposition of tropical varieties with rational balanced weightings. Additionally, we explore connections and applications related to rigidity theory. In particular, we prove that a tropical hypersurface is extremal if and only if it has a unique reciprocal diagram up to homothety.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>

Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Happy Ending: An Empty Hexagon in Every Set of 30 Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satisfiability solving has been used to tackle a range of long-standing open math problems in recent years. We add another success by solving a geometry problem that originated a century ago. In the 1930s, Esther Klein's exploration of unavoidable shapes in planar point sets in general position showed that every set of five points includes four points in convex position. For a long time, it was open if an empty hexagon, i.e., six points in convex position without a point inside, can be avoided. In 2006, Gerken and Nicol\'as independently proved that the answer is no. We establish the exact bound: Every 30-point set in the plane in general position contains an empty hexagon. Our key contributions include an effective, compact encoding and a search-space partitioning strategy enabling linear-time speedups even when using thousands of cores.</description>

Abstract: In modern usage the Bernoulli numbers and polynomials follow Euler's approach and are defined using generating functions. We consider the functional equation $f(x)+x^k=f(x+1)$ and show that a solution can be derived from Faulhaber's formula for the sum of powers. We show how these solutions provide a characterization of Bernoulli numbers and related results.</description>

      <title>On 13-Crossing-Critical Graphs with Arbitrarily Large Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.01104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent result of Bokal et al. [Combinatorica, 2022] proved that the exact minimum value of c such that c-crossing-critical graphs do not have bounded maximum degree is c=13. The key to that result is an inductive construction of a family of 13-crossing-critical graphs with many vertices of arbitrarily high degrees. While the inductive part of the construction is rather easy, it all relies on the fact that a certain 17-vertex base graph has the crossing number 13, which was originally verified only by a machine-readable computer proof. We provide a relatively short self-contained computer-free proof of the latter fact. Furthermore, we subsequently generalize the critical construction in order to provide a definitive answer to a remaining open question of this research area; we prove that for every c&gt;=13 and integers d,q, there exists a c-crossing-critical graph with more than q vertices of each of the degrees 3,4,...,d.</description>

      <title>Dichotomies for Maximum Matching Cut: $H$-Freeness, Bounded Diameter, Bounded Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01099v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (Perfect) Matching Cut problem is to decide if a graph $G$ has a (perfect) matching cut, i.e., a (perfect) matching that is also an edge cut of $G$. Both Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut are known to be NP-complete. A perfect matching cut is also a matching cut with maximum number of edges. To increase our understanding of the relationship between the two problems, we introduce the Maximum Matching Cut problem. This problem is to determine a largest matching cut in a graph. We generalize and unify known polynomial-time algorithms for Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut restricted to graphs of diameter at most $2$ and to $(P_6+sP_2)$-free graphs. We also show that the complexity of Maximum Matching Cut differs from the complexities of Matching Cut and Perfect Matching Cut by proving NP-hardness of Maximum Matching Cut for $2P_3$-free quadrangulated graphs of diameter $3$ and radius $2$ and for subcubic line graphs of triangle-free graphs. In this way, we obtain full dichotomies of Maximum Matching Cut for graphs of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. Finally, we apply our techniques to get a dichotomy for the Maximum Disconnected Perfect Matching problem for $H$-free graphs. A disconnected perfect matching of a graph $G$ is a perfect matching that contains a matching cut of $G$. The Maximum Disconnected Perfect Matching problem asks to determine for a connected graph $G$, a disconnected perfect matching with a largest matching cut over all disconnected perfect matchings of $G$. Our dichotomy result implies that the original decision problem Disconnected Perfect Matching is polynomial-time solvable for $(P_6+sP_2)$-free graphs for every $s\geq 0$, which resolves an open problem of Bouquet and Picouleau (arXiv, 2020).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concerning the recent notion of circular chromatic number of signed graphs, for each given integer $k$ we introduce two signed bipartite graphs, each on $2k^2-k+1$ vertices, having shortest negative cycle of length $2k$, and the circular chromatic number 4.
  Each of the construction can be viewed as a bipartite analogue of the generalized Mycielski graphs on odd cycles, $M_{\ell}(C_{2k+1})$. In the course of proving our result, we also obtain a simple proof of the fact that $M_{\ell}(C_{2k+1})$ and some similar quadrangulations of the projective plane have circular chromatic number 4. These proofs have the advantage that they illuminate, in an elementary manner, the strong relation between algebraic topology and graph coloring problems.</description>

      <title>String attractors of Rote sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe minimal string attractors (of size two) of pseudopalindromic prefixes of standard complementary-symmetric Rote sequences. Such a class of Rote sequences forms a subclass of binary generalized pseudostandard sequences, i.e., of sequences obtained when iterating palindromic and antipalindromic closures. When iterating only palindromic closure, palindromic prefixes of standard Sturmian sequences are obtained and their string attractors are of size two. However, already when iterating only antipalindromic closure, antipalindromic prefixes of binary pseudostandard sequences are obtained and we prove that the minimal string attractors are of size three in this case. We conjecture that the pseudopalindromic prefixes of any binary generalized pseudostandard sequence have a minimal string attractor of size at most four.</description>

      <title>Further results on covering codes with radius R and codimension tR + 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The length function $\ell_q(r,R)$ is the smallest possible length $n$ of a $ q $-ary linear $[n,n-r]_qR$ code with codimension (redundancy) $r$ and covering radius $R$. Let $s_q(N,\rho)$ be the smallest size of a $\rho$-saturating set in the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(N,q)$. There is a one-to-one correspondence between $[n,n-r]_qR$ codes and $(R-1)$-saturating $n$-sets in $\mathrm{PG}(r-1,q)$ that implies $\ell_q(r,R)=s_q(r-1,R-1)$. In this work, for $R\ge3$, new asymptotic upper bounds on $\ell_q(tR+1,R)$ are obtained in the following form:
  $\hspace{0.7cm} \bullet~\ell_q(tR+1,R) =s_q(tR,R-1)\le
  \sqrt[R]{\frac{R!}{R^{R-2}}}\cdot q^{(r-R)/R}\cdot\sqrt[R]{\ln q}+o(q^{(r-R)/R}), \hspace{0.3cm}r=tR+1,~t\ge1,~ q\text{ is an arbitrary prime power},~q\text{ is large enough};$
  $\hspace{0.7cm} \bullet~\text{ if additionally }R\text{ is large enough, then }\sqrt[R]{\frac{R!}{R^{R-2}}}\thicksim\frac{1}{e}\thickapprox0.3679. $
  The new bounds are essentially better than the known ones. For $t=1$, a new construction of $(R-1)$-saturating sets in the projective space $\mathrm{PG}(R,q)$, providing sets of small sizes, is proposed. The $[n,n-(R+1)]_qR$ codes, obtained by the construction, have minimum distance $R + 1$, i.e. they are almost MDS (AMDS) codes. These codes are taken as the starting ones in the lift-constructions (so-called "$q^m$-concatenating constructions") for covering codes to obtain infinite families of codes with growing codimension $r=tR+1$, $t\ge1$.</description>

      <title>Two Formulas for the Number of Lines on Complex Projective Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two formulas for the classical number $C_n$ of lines on a generic hypersurface of degree $2n-3$ in $\mathbb{CP}^n$ are obtained which differ from the formulas by Libgober, and van der Waerden-Zagier. Schubert calculus via the splitting principle leads to an explicit general closed-form formula in terms of the Catalan numbers and elementary symmetric polynomials. This in turn yields $C_n$ as a linear difference recursion relation of unbounded order. Thus, for the sequence of certain linear combinations of $C_n$, a simple generating function is found. Then, a result from random algebraic geometry by Basu, Lerario, Lundberg, and Peterson, that expresses these classical enumerative invariants as proportional to the Bombieri norm of particular polynomial determinants, yields another combinatorial expansion in terms of certain set compositions and block labeling counting. As an example, we compute this expansion for the 27 lines on a cubic surface and 2875 lines on a quintic threefold. As an application, we reobtain the parity and asymptotic upper bound of the sequence. In an appendix, we generalize the splitting principle calculation to obtain a formula for the number of lines on a generic complete intersection.</description>

      <title>Graphs with a given conditional diameter that maximize the Wiener index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wiener index $W(G)$ of a graph $G$ is one of the most well-known topological indices, which is defined as the sum of distances between all pairs of vertices of $G$. The diameter $D(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum distance between all pairs of vertices of $G$; the conditional diameter $D(G;s)$ is the maximum distance between all pairs of vertex subsets with cardinality $s$ of $G$. When $s=1$, the conditional diameter $D(G;s)$ is just the diameter $D(G)$. The authors in \cite{QS} characterized the graphs with the maximum Wiener index among all graphs with diameter $D(G)=n-c$, where $1\le c\le 4$. In this paper, we will characterize the graphs with the maximum Wiener index among all graphs with conditional diameter $D(G;s)=n-2s-c$ ( $-1\leq c\leq 1$), which extends partial results in \cite{QS}.</description>

      <title>On the Treewidth of Token and Johnson Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices and $1 \le k \le n$ a fixed integer. The $k$-token graph of $G$ is the graph, $F_k(G)$, whose vertex set is equal to all the $k$-subsets of $V(G)$; where two of them are adjacent whenever their symmetric difference is an edge of $G$. In this paper we study the treewidth of $F_k(G)$, when $G$ is a star, path or a complete graph. We show that in the first two cases, the treewidth is of order $\Theta(n^{k-1})$, and of order $\Theta(n^k)$ in the third case. We conjecture that our upper bound for the treewidth of $F_k(K_n)$ is tight. This is particularly relevant since $F_k(K_n)$ is isomorphic to the well known Johnson graph $J(n,k)$.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Shuffle Framework for Privacy Amplification: Strengthening Privacy Guarantees and Enhancing Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shuffle model of local differential privacy is an advanced method of privacy amplification designed to enhance privacy protection with high utility. It achieves this by randomly shuffling sensitive data, making linking individual data points to specific individuals more challenging. However, most existing studies have focused on the shuffle model based on $(\epsilon_0,0)$-Locally Differentially Private (LDP) randomizers, with limited consideration for complex scenarios such as $(\epsilon_0,\delta_0)$-LDP or personalized LDP (PLDP). This hinders a comprehensive understanding of the shuffle model's potential and limits its application in various settings. To bridge this research gap, we propose a generalized shuffle framework that can be applied to any $(\epsilon_i,\delta_i)$-PLDP setting with personalized privacy parameters. This generalization allows for a broader exploration of the privacy-utility trade-off and facilitates the design of privacy-preserving analyses in diverse contexts. We prove that shuffled $(\epsilon_i,\delta_i)$-PLDP process approximately preserves $\mu$-Gaussian Differential Privacy with \mu = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1-\delta_i}{1+e^{\epsilon_i}}-\max_{i}{\frac{1-\delta_{i}}{1+e^{\epsilon_{i}}}}}}. $
  This approach allows us to avoid the limitations and potential inaccuracies associated with inequality estimations. To strengthen the privacy guarantee, we improve the lower bound by utilizing hypothesis testing} instead of relying on rough estimations like the Chernoff bound or Hoeffding's inequality. Furthermore, extensive comparative evaluations clearly show that our approach outperforms existing methods in achieving strong central privacy guarantees while preserving the utility of the global model. We have also carefully designed corresponding algorithms for average function, frequency estimation, and stochastic gradient descent.</description>
