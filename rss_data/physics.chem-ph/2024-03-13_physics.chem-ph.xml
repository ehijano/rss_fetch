      <title>Water Isotope Separation using Deep Learning and a Catalytically Active Ultrathin Membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water isotope separation, specifically separating heavy from light water, is a socially significant issue due to the usage of heavy water in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance, nuclear power, and spectroscopy. Separation of heavy water from light water is difficult due to very similar physical and chemical properties between the isotopes. We show that a catalytically active ultrathin membrane (e.g., a nanopore in MoS2) can enable chemical exchange processes and physicochemical mechanisms that lead to efficient separation of deuterium from hydrogen, quantified as the D2O and deuterium separation ratio of 4.5 and 1.73, respectively. The separation process is inherently multiscale in nature with the shorter times representing chemical exchange processes and the longer timescales representing the transport phenomena. To bridge the timescales, we employ a deep learning methodology which uses short time scale ab-initio molecular dynamics data for training and extends the timescales to classical molecular dynamics regime to demonstrate isotope separation and reveal the underlying complex physicochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio variational wave functions for the time-dependent many-electron Schr\"odinger equation</title>

Abstract: Describing the dynamics of many-electron quantum systems is crucial for applications such as predicting electronic structures in quantum chemistry, the properties of condensed matter systems, and the behaviors of complex materials. However, the real-time evolution of non-equilibrium quantum electronic systems poses a significant challenge for theoretical and computational approaches, due to the system's exploration of a vast configuration space. This work introduces a variational approach for fermionic time-dependent wave functions, surpassing mean-field approximations by capturing many-body correlations. The proposed methodology involves parameterizing the time-evolving quantum state, enabling the approximation of the state's evolution. To account for electron correlations, we employ time-dependent Jastrow factors and backflow transformations. We also show that we can incorporate neural networks to parameterize these functions. The time-dependent variational Monte Carlo technique is employed to efficiently compute the optimal time-dependent parameters. The approach is demonstrated in three distinct systems: the solvable harmonic interaction model, the dynamics of a diatomic molecule in intense laser fields, and a quenched quantum dot. In all cases, we show clear signatures of many-body correlations in the dynamics not captured by mean-field methods. The results showcase the ability of our variational approach to accurately capture the time evolution of quantum states, providing insight into the quantum dynamics of interacting electronic systems, beyond the capabilities of mean-field.</description>

      <title>Gradual Optimization Learning for Conformational Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular conformation optimization is crucial to computer-aided drug discovery and materials design. Traditional energy minimization techniques rely on iterative optimization methods that use molecular forces calculated by a physical simulator (oracle) as anti-gradients. However, this is a computationally expensive approach that requires many interactions with a physical simulator. One way to accelerate this procedure is to replace the physical simulator with a neural network. Despite recent progress in neural networks for molecular conformation energy prediction, such models are prone to distribution shift, leading to inaccurate energy minimization. We find that the quality of energy minimization with neural networks can be improved by providing optimization trajectories as additional training data. Still, it takes around $5 \times 10^5$ additional conformations to match the physical simulator's optimization quality. In this work, we present the Gradual Optimization Learning Framework (GOLF) for energy minimization with neural networks that significantly reduces the required additional data. The framework consists of an efficient data-collecting scheme and an external optimizer. The external optimizer utilizes gradients from the energy prediction model to generate optimization trajectories, and the data-collecting scheme selects additional training data to be processed by the physical simulator. Our results demonstrate that the neural network trained with GOLF performs on par with the oracle on a benchmark of diverse drug-like molecules using $50$x less additional data.</description>

      <title>Exchange-correlation energy from Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DFT calculations yield useful ground-state energies and densities, while Green's function techniques (such as $GW$) are mostly used to produce spectral functions. From the Galitskii-Migdal formula, we extract the exchange-correlation of DFT directly from a Green's function. This spectral representation provides an alternative to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of DFT, identifying distinct single-particle and many-particle contributions. Results are illustrated on the uniform electron gas and the two-site Hubbard model.</description>
