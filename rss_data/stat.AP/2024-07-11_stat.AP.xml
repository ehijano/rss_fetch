      <title>Wind Power Assessment based on Super-Resolution and Downscaling -- A Comparison of Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient placement of wind turbines relies on accurate local wind speed forecasts. Climate projections provide valuable insight into long-term wind speed conditions, yet their spatial data resolution is typically insufficient for precise wind power forecasts. Deep learning methods, particularly models developed for image super-resolution, offer a promising solution to bridge this scale gap by increasing the spatial resolution of climate models. In this paper, we compare the performance of various deep learning models on two distinct tasks: super-resolution, where we map artificially coarsened ERA5 data to its native resolution, and downscaling, where we map native ERA5 to high-resolution COSMO-REA6 data. We evaluate the models on their downstream application in forecasting long-term wind power, emphasizing the impact of spatial wind speed resolution on wind power estimates. Our findings highlight the importance of aligning models and evaluation metrics with their specific downstream applications. We show that a diffusion model outperforms other models for estimating the wind power potential by better preserving the wind speeds' distributional and physical properties.</description>

      <title>PEP: a tackle value measuring the prevention of expected points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional assessments of tackling in American Football often only consider the number of tackles made, without adequately accounting for their context and importance for the game. Aiming for improvement, we develop a metric that quantifies the value of a tackle in terms of the prevented expected points (PEP). Specifically, we compare the real end-of-play yard line of tackles with the predicted yard line given the hypothetical situation that the tackle had been missed. For this, we use high-resolution tracking data, that capture the position and velocity of players, and a random forest to account for uncertainty and multi-modality in yard-line prediction. Moreover, we acknowledge the difference in the importance of tackles by assigning an expected points value to each individual tree prediction of the random forest. Finally, to relate the value of tackles to a player's ability to tackle, we fit a suitable mixed-effect model to the PEP values. Our approach contributes to a deeper understanding of defensive performances in American football and offers valuable insights for coaches and analysts.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of motor-evoked potential recruitment curves yields accurate and robust estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic stimulation probes and modulates the neural systems that control movement. Key to understanding their effects is the muscle recruitment curve, which maps evoked potential size against stimulation intensity. Current methods to estimate curve parameters require large samples; however, obtaining these is often impractical due to experimental constraints. Here, we present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that accounts for small samples, handles outliers, simulates high-fidelity data, and returns a posterior distribution over curve parameters that quantify estimation uncertainty. It uses a rectified-logistic function that estimates motor threshold and outperforms conventionally used sigmoidal alternatives in predictive performance, as demonstrated through cross-validation. In simulations, our method outperforms non-hierarchical models by reducing threshold estimation error on sparse data and requires fewer participants to detect shifts in threshold compared to frequentist testing. We present two common use cases involving electrical and electromagnetic stimulation data and provide an open-source library for Python, called hbMEP, for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>The Game of Band or Bump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report we generalize the game of Book or Band described in Levin (2024) to an arbitrary playing deck with $m$ ranks and $s$ cards in each rank, for a total of $t=ms$ cards. Two events (a band or a bump) are defined in terms of given non-negative integers $0\le l\le u \le s$, not necessarily with $l+u=s$. We derive expressions for the joint stopping time distribution and outcome band or bump in terms of rectangular event probabilities for central multiple hyper-geometric random variables.</description>

      <title>Valuation of travel time savings in the presence of simultaneous activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time sharing between activities remains an indispensable part of everyday activity pattern. However, the issue has not yet been fully acknowledged within the existing time allocation models, potentially resulting in inaccuracies in valuing travel time savings. Therefore this study is aimed at addressing this gap by investigating the potential impact of introducing time sharing within such a framework, as well as factors determining it as represented by travel activities. In doing so, time constraint in the time allocation model of Small was modified to enable sharing the same time interval between different activities. The resulting expression indicated that such an augmentation could lead to lower estimates of value of time as a resource. On the other hand, empirical research based on the data from the National Passenger Survey 2004 used for calibrating cross-nested logit model indicated a number of factors affecting the choice of travel activities. It was discovered that significant include possession of equipment allowing particular activities, e.g. newspaper, paperwork or ICT devices, companionship, gender, length of the journey, frequency of using the service, possibility of working on the train, journey planning in advance, first class travel, termination of the trip in central London, peak-time travel and availability of seating.</description>

      <title>Vox Populi, Vox AI? Using Language Models to Estimate German Public Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent development of large language models (LLMs) has spurred discussions about whether LLM-generated "synthetic samples" could complement or replace traditional surveys, considering their training data potentially reflects attitudes and behaviors prevalent in the population. A number of mostly US-based studies have prompted LLMs to mimic survey respondents, with some of them finding that the responses closely match the survey data. However, several contextual factors related to the relationship between the respective target population and LLM training data might affect the generalizability of such findings. In this study, we investigate the extent to which LLMs can estimate public opinion in Germany, using the example of vote choice. We generate a synthetic sample of personas matching the individual characteristics of the 2017 German Longitudinal Election Study respondents. We ask the LLM GPT-3.5 to predict each respondent's vote choice and compare these predictions to the survey-based estimates on the aggregate and subgroup levels. We find that GPT-3.5 does not predict citizens' vote choice accurately, exhibiting a bias towards the Green and Left parties. While the LLM captures the tendencies of "typical" voter subgroups, such as partisans, it misses the multifaceted factors swaying individual voter choices. By examining the LLM-based prediction of voting behavior in a new context, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be leveraged for studying public opinion. The findings point to disparities in opinion representation in LLMs and underscore the limitations in applying them for public opinion estimation.</description>

      <title>Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01740v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a replication and correction of a recent article (Ramirez, P., Reade, J.J., Singleton, C., Betting on a buzz: Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks, International Journal of Forecasting, 39:3, 2023, pp. 1413-1423, doi: 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011). RRS measure profile page views on Wikipedia to generate a "buzz factor" metric for tennis players and show that it can be used to form a profitable gambling strategy by predicting bookmaker mispricing. Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their results exactly, thus confirming the robustness of their mispricing claim. However, we discover that the published betting results are significantly affected by a single bet (the "Hercog" bet), which returns substantial outlier profits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is resolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy, which bets on "competitive" matches, remains significantly profitable in the original out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker support than the original study, it still provides an indication that market inefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we continue backtesting after 2020 on a cleaned dataset. Results show that (a) the "competitive" strategy generates no further profits, potentially suggesting markets have become more efficient, and (b) model coefficients estimated over this more recent period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker mispricing. We present this work as a case study demonstrating the importance of replication studies in sports forecasting, and the necessity to clean data. We open-source release comprehensive datasets and code.</description>

      <title>Using iterated local alignment to aggregate trajectory data into a traffic flow map</title>

Abstract: Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. Vehicle trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching implementations produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Global Maritime Traffic Network Forecasting with Gravity-Inspired Deep Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) pose significant threats to biodiversity, disrupting ecosystems and inflicting substantial economic damages across agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. Due to the fast growth of global trade and transportation networks, NIS has been introduced and spread unintentionally in new environments. This study develops a new physics-informed model to forecast maritime shipping traffic between port regions worldwide. The predicted information provided by these models, in turn, is used as input for risk assessment of NIS spread through transportation networks to evaluate the capability of our solution. Inspired by the gravity model for international trades, our model considers various factors that influence the likelihood and impact of vessel activities, such as shipping flux density, distance between ports, trade flow, and centrality measures of transportation hubs. Accordingly, this paper introduces transformers to gravity models to rebuild the short- and long-term dependencies that make the risk analysis feasible. Thus, we introduce a physics-inspired framework that achieves an 89% binary accuracy for existing and non-existing trajectories and an 84.8% accuracy for the number of vessels flowing between key port areas, representing more than 10% improvement over the traditional deep-gravity model. Along these lines, this research contributes to a better understanding of NIS risk assessment. It allows policymakers, conservationists, and stakeholders to prioritize management actions by identifying high-risk invasion pathways. Besides, our model is versatile and can include new data sources, making it suitable for assessing international vessel traffic flow in a changing global landscape.</description>
