      <title>Correlation-weighted 23Na magnetic resonance fingerprinting in the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07006v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a new sodium magnetic resonance fingerprinting ($^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF) method for the simultaneous mapping of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$ and sodium density with built-in $\Delta\text{B}_{1}^{+}$ (radiofrequency transmission inhomogeneities) and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ corrections (frequency offsets). We based our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF implementation on a 3D FLORET sequence with 23 radiofrequency pulses. To capture the complex spin ${\frac{\text{3}}{\text{2}}}$ dynamics of the $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ nucleus, the fingerprint dictionary was simulated using the irreducible spherical tensor operators formalism. The dictionary contained 831,512 entries covering a wide range of $\text{T}_\text{1}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,long}^{*}$, $\text{T}_\text{2,short}^{*}$, $\Delta\text{B}_\text{1}^{+}$ factor and $\Delta\text{f}_\text{0}$ parameters. Fingerprint matching was performed using the Pearson correlation and the resulting relaxation maps were weighted with a subset of the highest correlation coefficients corresponding to signal matches for each voxel. Our $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF method was compared against reference methods in a 7-compartment phantom, and applied in brain in five healthy volunteers at 7 T. In phantoms, $^\text{23}\text{Na}$ MRF produced values comparable to those obtained with reference methods. Average sodium relaxation time values in cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and white matter across five healthy volunteers were in good agreement with values previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Image Reconstruction in Cone Beam Computed Tomography Using Controlled Gradient Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total variation (TV) regularization is a popular reconstruction method for ill-posed imaging problems, and particularly useful for applications with piecewise constant targets. However, using TV for medical cone-beam computed X-ray tomography (CBCT) has been limited so far, mainly due to heavy computational loads at clinically relevant 3D resolutions and the difficulty in choosing the regularization parameter. Here an efficient minimization algorithm is presented, combined with a dynamic parameter adjustment based on control theory. The result is a fully automatic 3D reconstruction method running in clinically acceptable time. The input on top of projection data and system geometry is desired degree of sparsity of the reconstruction. This can be determined from an atlas of CT scans, or alternatively used as an easily adjustable parameter with straightforward interpretation.</description>

      <title>Direct Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction on GPU using Out-Of-Core: Precision and Quality Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07631v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic methods applied to the reconstruction of Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) can provide both a high image quality and a decrease in the dose received by patients, although with an increased reconstruction time since their computational costs are higher. In our work, we present a new algebraic implementation that obtains an exact solution to the system of linear equations that models the problem and based on single-precision floating-point arithmetic. By applying Out-Of-Core (OOC) techniques, the dimensions of the system can be increased regardless of the main memory size and as long as there is enough secondary storage (disk). These techniques have allowed to process images of 768 x 768 pixels. A comparative study of our method on a GPU using both single-precision and double-precision arithmetic has been carried out. The goal is to assess the single-precision arithmetic implementation both in terms of time improvement and quality of the reconstructed images to determine if it is sufficient to consider it a viable option. Results using single-precision arithmetic approximately halves the reconstruction time of the double-precision implementation, whereas the obtained images retain all internal structures despite having higher noise levels.</description>

      <title>A No-Reference Medical Image Quality Assessment Method Based on Automated Distortion Recognition Technology: Application to Preprocessing in MRI-guided Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective:To develop a no-reference image quality assessment method using automated distortion recognition to boost MRI-guided radiotherapy precision.Methods:We analyzed 106,000 MR images from 10 patients with liver metastasis,captured with the Elekta Unity MR-LINAC.Our No-Reference Quality Assessment Model includes:1)image preprocessing to enhance visibility of key diagnostic features;2)feature extraction and directional analysis using MSCN coefficients across four directions to capture textural attributes and gradients,vital for identifying image features and potential distortions;3)integrative Quality Index(QI)calculation,which integrates features via AGGD parameter estimation and K-means clustering.The QI,based on a weighted MAD computation of directional scores,provides a comprehensive image quality measure,robust against outliers.LOO-CV assessed model generalizability and performance.Tumor tracking algorithm performance was compared with and without preprocessing to verify tracking accuracy enhancements.Results:Preprocessing significantly improved image quality,with the QI showing substantial positive changes and surpassing other metrics.After normalization,the QI's average value was 79.6 times higher than CNR,indicating improved image definition and contrast.It also showed higher sensitivity in detail recognition with average values 6.5 times and 1.7 times higher than Tenengrad gradient and entropy.The tumor tracking algorithm confirmed significant tracking accuracy improvements with preprocessed images,validating preprocessing effectiveness.Conclusions:This study introduces a novel no-reference image quality evaluation method based on automated distortion recognition,offering a new quality control tool for MRIgRT tumor tracking.It enhances clinical application accuracy and facilitates medical image quality assessment standardization, with significant clinical and research value.</description>
