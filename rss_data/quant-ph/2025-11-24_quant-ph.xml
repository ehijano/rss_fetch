      <title>Quantum artificial intelligence for pattern recognition at high-energy colliders: Tales of Three "Quantum's"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing applications are an emerging field in high-energy physics. Its ambitious fusion with artificial intelligence is expected to deliver significant efficiency gains over existing methods and/or enable computation from a fundamentally different perspective. High-energy physics is a big data science that utilizes large-scale facilities, detectors, high-performance computing, and its worldwide networks. The experimental workflow consumes a significant amount of computing resources, and its annual cost will continue to grow exponentially at future colliders. In particular, pattern recognition is one of the most crucial and computationally intensive tasks. Three types of quantum computing technologies, i.e., quantum gates, quantum annealing, and quantum-inspired, are all actively investigated for high-energy physics applications, and each has its pros and cons. This article reviews the current status of quantum computing applications for pattern recognition at high-energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Quantum Resource Landscape of Entropy Vector Space Using Machine Learning and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning framework to study the dynamics of entropy vectors and quantum resources, including entanglement and magic, focusing on violations of entropy inequalities. Using a reinforcement learning agent formulated as a Markov decision process, we identify quantum circuits that optimally navigate the entropy vector space to generate violations of Ingleton's inequality. We complement this approach with a classical optimization algorithm to produce arbitrary numbers of Ingleton-violating states, with tunable degrees of violation, and empirically determine the maximal attainable violation for Ingleton's inequality. Our analysis reveals characteristic patterns of quantum resources that accompany Ingleton violation. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that Ingleton-violating states occupy sharply-defined, isolated regions of the Hilbert space, and are extremely rare. Together, these results establish a unified computational toolkit for studying entropy vector dynamics, tracking quantum resource evolution, and engineering circuits with controlled information-theoretic features.</description>

      <title>Magnetically induced Josephson nano-diodes in field-resilient superconducting microwave circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of nonlinear and frequency-tunable superconducting microwave circuits for operation in large magnetic fields is of high relevance for hybrid quantum systems such as spin resonance spectrometers, microwave quantum magnonics, dark matter axion detectors or flux-mediated optomechanics. With these exciting perspectives in mind, we investigate niobium-based circuits with integrated nano-constriction quantum interferometers in magnetic in-plane fields up to several hundred mT. Our experiments reveal an unexpected and pronounced field-induced asymmetry in the bias-flux response of the circuits, which is demonstrated to originate from a field-induced Josephson-diode effect within the nano-constrictions and which considerably enhances the circuit figures of merit in a magnetic field. An intuitive macroscopic Josephson-diode model attributes the effect to inhomogeneous constriction properties and provides us with the diode current-phase relation as a function of the in-plane field. Finally, we demonstrate that in the diode-state the circuit Kerr nonlinearity is bimodal in frequency, not only eliminating alternative explanations for the bias-flux-asymmetries but also being potentially useful for quantum circuit applications. Overall, our report underlines that niobium nano-constriction circuits belong to the most promising candidates for high-field hybrid quantum systems and reveals the untapped potential of combining Josephson nano-diodes with microwave quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-spin decoupling for noise-resilient DC quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excellent sensitivities of quantum sensors are a double-edged sword: minuscule quantities can be observed, but any undesired signal acts as noise. This is challenging when detecting quantities that are obscured by such noise. Decoupling sequences improve coherence times and hence sensitivities, though only AC signals in narrow frequency bands are distinguishable. Alternatively, comagnetometers operate gaseous spin mixtures at high temperatures in the self-compensating regime to counteract slowly varying noise. These are applied with great success in various exotic spin-interaction searches. Here, we propose a method that decouples specific DC fields from DC and AC magnetic noise. It requires any spin cluster where the effect on each individual spin is different for the target field and local magnetic fields, which allows for a different approach compared to comagnetometers. The presented method has several key advantages, including an orders-of-magnitude increase in noise frequencies to which we are resistant. We explore electron-spin nuclear-spin pairs in nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond, with a focus on their merit for light dark-matter searches. Other applications include gradient sensing, quantum memory, and gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic reverse annealing is robust to low-temperature decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) is an improvement to conventional quantum annealing (QA) that uses an initial guess at the desired ground state to circumvent problematic phase transitions. Despite encouraging results in the closed-system setting, Ref. [1] has suggested on the basis of numerical simulations that ARA may lose its advantage in the presence of decoherence. Here, we revisit this problem from a more analytical perspective. Using the $p$-spin model as a solvable example, together with the adiabatic master equation to describe the effects of the environment (valid at weak coupling), we show that ARA can in fact succeed in open systems but that the temperature of the environment plays a key role. We first demonstrate that, in the adiabatic limit, the system will follow the instantaneous equilibrium state as long as the protocol does not pass through any (finite-temperature) phase transitions. Given this, there are two distinct mechanisms by which ARA can break down at high temperature: either there are no paths that avoid transitions, or the equilibrium state itself is disordered. When the temperature is sufficiently low that neither of these occur, then ARA succeeds. Remarkably, there are even situations in which the environment benefits ARA: we find parameter values for which no transition-avoiding paths exist at zero temperature but such paths appear at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Unitary synthesis with optimal brick wall circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present quantum circuits with a brick wall structure using the optimal number of parameters and two-qubit gates to parametrize $SU(2^n)$, and provide evidence that these circuits are universal for $n\leq 5$. For this, we successfully compile random matrices to the presented circuits and show that their Jacobian has full rank almost everywhere in the domain. Our method provides a new state of the art for synthesizing typical unitary matrices from $SU(2^n)$ for $n=3, 4, 5$, and we extend it to the subgroups $SO(2^n)$ and $Sp^\ast(2^n)$. We complement this numerical method by a partial proof, which hinges on an open conjecture that relates universality of an ansatz to it having full Jacobian rank almost everywhere.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computational Science: A Perspective from Block-Encodings and Polynomial Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant developments made in quantum hardware and error correction recently have been driving quantum computing towards practical utility. However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this Perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. We present recent advancements on these topics including construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. We also highlight the scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this Perspective serves as a gentle introduction of state-of-the-art quantum algorithms to the computational science community, and inspires future development on scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Conserved quantities enable the quantum Mpemba effect in weakly open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observation of the quantum Mpemba effect has spurred much interest in its enabling conditions and its relation to the classical counterpart. Here, we consider weakly open many-body quantum systems initialized in different thermal states and examine when the initially farther state relaxes to the (non-equilibrium) steady state faster. We claim that the number of conserved quantities in the unitary part plays a crucial role: the Mpemba effect is possible only when the Hamiltonian commutes with other extensive operators or is integrable. The reason lies in the dynamical evolution happening in spaces of different dimensions. When energy is the only approximately conserved quantity, dissipation pushes the dynamics within a single-parameter manifold of different thermal states. In contrast, for Hamiltonians with several conserved quantities, the dynamics drift in the multi-dimensional space of generalized Gibbs ensembles, whose distance to the steady state is less trivial. We provide numerical results for large system sizes using tensor networks and free-fermion techniques, thereby supporting our claim.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of a quantum network is to enable the generation of end-to-end entangled links between end nodes of the network, so that they can execute quantum network applications. To facilitate this, it is desirable to have robust control of the network in order to be able to provide a reliable service to the end nodes. In recent work arXiv:2503.12582, we proposed a modular control architecture for a generate-when-request type network. This control architecture enables quantum network applications to be executed on end nodes running a modern operating system such as QNodeOS arXiv:2407.18306. In that work, we performed an evaluation of our architecture based on a proof-of-concept implementation. In the course of performing this evaluation, we discovered many outstanding questions and challenges. These relate not only to implementing our specific control architecture, but also to the design of any quantum network control architecture. Here, we describe some outstanding questions and challenges, discuss possible solutions, and identify where existing protocols require adaptation or new protocols must be designed.</description>

      <title>Efficiently learning non-Markovian noise in many-body quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum simulators are scaled up to larger system sizes and lower noise rates, non-Markovian noise channels are expected to become dominant. While provably efficient protocols for Markovian models of quantum simulators, either closed system models (described by a Hamiltonian) or open system models (described by a Lindbladian), have been developed, it remains less well understood whether similar protocols for non-Markovian models exist. In this paper, we consider geometrically local lattice models with both quantum and classical non-Markovian noise and show that, under a Gaussian assumption on the noise, we can learn the noise with sample complexity scaling logarithmically with the system size. Our protocol requires preparing the simulator qubits initially in a product state, introducing a layer of single-qubit Clifford gates and measuring product observables.</description>

      <title>Coherence and contextuality as quantum resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore the intersection of two fundamental subfields of quantum information theory: quantum coherence and contextuality. Despite their apparent differences, both areas address key issues relevant to the foundations and applications of quantum theory. By developing a novel graph-theoretic approach, extending a framework recently introduced by Galv\~ao and Brod (Phys. Rev. A 101, 062110, 2020), we establish a formal connection between inequality-based witnesses of quantum coherence and noncontextuality inequalities. Our key contributions include: the development of a graph-theoretic framework for generating coherence and contextuality witnesses; a formal mapping between the inequalities that follows from the work by Galv\~ao and Brod to existing noncontextuality inequalities; the conceptualization of a relational form of quantum coherence; a proof of contextual advantage for the task of quantum interrogation; and the discovery of an infinite family of coherence witnesses that also require quantum states in Hilbert spaces of specific dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Learning of Topological-to-Ferromagnetic Phase Transitions in the 2+1D Toric Code Loop Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum data learning (QDL) provides a framework for extracting physical insights directly from quantum states, bypassing the need for any identification of the classical observable of the theory. A central challenge in many-body physics is that the identity of quantum phases, especially those with topological order, are often inaccessible through local observables or simple symmetry-breaking diagnostics. Here, we apply QDL techniques to the 2+1-dimensional toric-code loop-gas model in a magnetic field. Ground states are generated across multiple lattice sizes using a parametrized loop-gas circuit (PLGC) with a variational quantum-eigensolver (VQE) approach. We then train a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) across the full field-parameter range to perform phase classification and capture the overall phase structure. We also employ a physics-aware training protocol that excludes the near-critical region (0.2 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.4)) around (x_c = 0.25), the phase-transition point estimated by quantum Monte Carlo, reserving this window for testing to evaluate the ability of the model to learn the phase transition. In parallel, we implement an unsupervised quantum k-means method based on state overlaps, which partitions the dataset into two phases without prior labeling. Our supervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and accurately locates the phase transition, in close agreement with previously reported values; the unsupervised QDL approach recovers the phase structure and locates the phase transition with a small offset as expected in finite volumes; both QDL methods outperform classical alternatives. These findings establish QDL as an effective framework for characterizing topological quantum matter, studying finite volume effects, and probing phase diagrams of higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing for simultaneous gate operations on multiple qubits via a shared control line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing number of qubits in quantum processors necessitates a corresponding increase in the number of control lines between the processor, which is typically operated at cryogenic temperatures, and external electronics. Scaling poses significant challenges in terms of the thermal loads, forming a major bottleneck in the realization of large-scale quantum computers. In this study, we analyze simultaneous gate operations on multiple qubits using microwaves transmitted via a single cable in a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) scheme. By employing rectangular control microwave pulses, we reveal the contribution of drive frequency spacing to gate fidelity. Through theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal microwave signals suppress interference in simultaneously driven qubits, thereby ensuring high gate fidelity. Additionally, we provide design guidelines for key parameters, including pulse length, number of multiplexed microwave signals, and rotation angle, to achieve precise qubit operations. Our findings enable a scalable FDM-based microwave control scheme suitable for quantum processors with a large number of qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optical Simulator for Unruh-DeWitt Detector Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-optical platform for simulating relativistic detector-field interactions using entangled nonlinear biphoton sources (ENBSs), realized through phase-controlled single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) sources. By mapping the dynamical evolution of this system onto the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector model, we show that signal-mode excitations emulate detector transitions driven by vacuum fluctuations, while coherently seeded idler modes act as an effective quantum field. This correspondence enables tabletop exploration of Unruh-like excitation, coherence harvesting, and field-induced entanglement. We derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and Lindblad master equation for two coherently seeded ENBS units and obtain analytical solutions for the signal photon number \(N_{\rm sig}(t)\) and second-order correlation function \(g^{(2)}(0;t)\). Numerical simulations confirm that phase-dependent biphoton dynamics reproduce UDW-type behavior, including tunable excitation and quantum correlations. The output signal state exhibits controllable fidelity, interference visibility, and entanglement entropy as functions of the seeding phase and amplitude. These results establish ENBSs as experimentally accessible quantum simulators of relativistic field phenomena, providing a photonic testbed for analog gravitational effects, vacuum fluctuations, and spacetime-induced coherence-all within reach of current nonlinear-optics technology.</description>

      <title>Quantum backflow in biased tight-binding systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of quantum backflow in tight-binding systems with complex couplings, considering different boundary conditions and lattice sizes. Backflow is an intrinsically non-classical effect where the density flux associated with a particle described by the superposition of wave functions with, say, positive momentum, acquires negative values. We calculate the superposition of positive momentum states that gives rise to the strongest backflow in the systems. We also evaluate the bounds on the total amount of probability that flows in the opposite direction of the particle's momentum.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy on a single nonlinear mode recognizes quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising optical quantum states is essential for the development of quantum technologies. While traditional approaches to perform full quantum state tomography are often experimentally demanding, neuromorphic architectures may provide an effective alternative. In this work, we demonstrate how a quantum nonlinear driven-dissipative mode is sufficient to act as a quantum reservoir. By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Storage of Frequency-Multiplexed Photons Exhibiting Nonclassical Correlations with Telecom C-Band Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexing is essential for improving entanglement distribution rates in quantum communication. Frequency multiplexing provides a promising and scalable path toward large-capacity quantum networks. Further progress requires increasing the number of frequency modes and developing broadband photon-pair sources and quantum memories that are spectrally compatible. Here, we report the integration of a cavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion source in the telecom C-band with a frequency-multiplexed atomic frequency comb memory. The bow-tie cavity source was simultaneously resonant at 606 nm and 1550 nm, generating non-degenerate photon pairs exhibiting a clustered frequency-comb spectrum. The atomic frequency comb memory, implemented in Praseodymium-doped Yttrium Orthosilicate crystals, provided up to 83 frequency modes with 123 MHz spacing and enabled broadband storage of 606 nm signal photons. By filtering the main cluster, we obtained $32.7 \pm 4.8$ effective modes, as confirmed from coincidence measurements. Importantly, we observed strong nonclassical correlations after storage, with cross-correlation values of $g_{s,i}^{(2)} = 8.1\pm0.7$. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating cavity-enhanced photon-pair sources with rare-earth-ion-doped solid-state memories. The integration reveals a high frequency multiplicity that is essential for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantum Mpemba Effect in a Dissipative Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a hotter system cools faster than a colder one under otherwise identical conditions, has been extensively studied in classical systems. In this work, we present the quantum analogue of the Mpemba effect using a dissipative qubit, which is referred to as the canonical quantum Mpemba effect. We demonstrate that, under the identical conditions, the relaxation dynamics of a qubit initialized in a thermal state with a higher temperature can be exponentially faster than those of a colder thermal state. Strikingly, this acceleration is determined solely by the initial temperature of the system, independent of other parameters. The relaxation is confirmed to be a genuine cooling process via the effective steady state temperature, mirroring its classical counterpart. Last, we propose a practical classical quantum hybrid algorithmic quantum circuit to realize this effect using superconducting qubits experimentally.</description>

      <title>All steerable quantum correlations can provide thermodynamic advantages in cooling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The removal of heat generated during computation poses a major challenge for both classical and quantum information processing. In particular, heat removal is directly linked to a fundamental requirement of quantum computation: the ability to reset a system to a pure state before computation. Efficient cooling is therefore crucial both for advancing our understanding of thermodynamics in the quantum regime and for enabling the development of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we devise a cooling task that exploits steerability, a fundamental form of quantum correlations, to demonstrate a provable quantum advantage over classically correlated scenarios in which steerability is absent. We quantify this advantage by the ratio between the heat removed using steerable quantum correlations and the heat removed using unsteerable classical correlations. Specifically, we show that steerable quantum correlations always provide a thermodynamic advantage in the cooling task. Remarkably, we further establish that the maximum achievable advantage is directly related to a geometric measure of steerability known as steerability robustness. Our results suggest that this thermodynamic advantage can serve as a witness of steerability. Finally, we present examples showing that the advantage can increase with the dimension of the underlying system.</description>

      <title>Bell state analysis using orbital angular momentum and path degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell state analysis (BSA) constitutes a foundational operation for distinguishing Bell states in numerous quantum information processing (QIP) protocols. In this work, we propose a theoretical scheme for realizing a perfect BSA tailored for polarized Bell states, with assistance from orbital angular momentum (OAM) and path entanglement. The linear-optics-based architecture for BSA circumvents the inherent limitations of nonlinear optical processes and enhances the robustness against environmental noise -- a major challenge in practical QIP implementations. The integrating hyperentanglement (combining polarization, OAM, and path degrees of freedom (DOFs)) raises the theoretical success probability to 100%, achieving deterministic BSA. This deterministic BSA scheme offers a promising route toward practical, high-performance QIP in photonic systems, leveraging current experimental techniques and addressing key limitations of existing methods.</description>

      <title>50-km fiber interferometer for testing gravitational signatures in quantum interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics and general relativity are the foundational pillars of modern physics, yet experimental tests that combine the two frameworks remain rare. Measuring optical phase shifts of massless photons in a gravitational potential provides a unique quantum platform to probe gravity beyond Newtonian descriptions, but laboratory-based interferometers have not yet reached the sensitivity needed to access this regime. Here, we report the realization of a 50-km table-top Mach-Zehnder fiber interferometer operating at the single-photon level, achieving a phase sensitivity of $4.42\times10^{-6}$ rad root-mean-square (RMS) within the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 5 Hz. We demonstrate that this sensitivity is sufficient to resolve a phase-shift signal of $(6.18 \pm 0.44)\times10^{-5}$ rad RMS at 0.1 Hz, associated with a modulated gravity-induced signal. Our results establish a milestone for quantum sensing with large-scale optical interferometry, demonstrating the capability to detect gravitational redshifts in a local laboratory, thereby paving the way for testing quantum phenomena within general relativistic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Chiral cavity-magnonic system for the unidirectional photon blockade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an scheme for directional single-photon source based on a chiral cavity-magnon system. In this system, the magnon mode in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere is coupled to only one of two rotating microwave modes in the torus-shaped microwave cavity. When two-photon drives are applied to both ports of the waveguide, the chiral cavity-magnon coupling leads to an unconventional photon blockade in one propagation direction, resulting in directional single-photon emission. The emission direction of the single-photon source can be controlled by reversing the biased magnetic field. Furthermore, we further examine the effects of imperfect chiral cavity-magnon coupling and the coupling between the two cavity modes on the photon blockade behavior. The results show that the system retains robustness in the presence of these nonideal factors, and the unidirectional photon blockade effect remains clearly preserved.</description>

      <title>Critical dephasing rates for the observation of collective behavior in a pair of coupled quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient atom-photon interfaces require the controlled assembly of quantum emitters, where collective effects such as superradiance and subradiance can emerge. Recent experiments with subwavelength arrays of quantum dots have observed superradiance at room temperature, revealing a delicate competition between collective enhancement of coherent emission and pure dephasing $\gamma^*$, which destroys it. Motivated by these results, we theoretically study $N=2$ coupled quantum emitters and identify threshold values of $\gamma^*$, for four experimentally accessible observables, beyond which collective effects vanish. The thresholds depend sensitively on the chosen observable, highlighting the subtlety of detecting collective behavior. Our work provides a quantitative framework to guide experiments and optimize conditions for observing collective quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Quantum Reinforcement Learning: A Systematic Evaluation of Key Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterised quantum circuit (PQC) based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm at the intersection of quantum computing and reinforcement learning (RL). By design, PQCs create hybrid quantum-classical models, but their practical applicability remains uncertain due to training instabilities, barren plateaus (BPs), and the difficulty of isolating the contribution of individual pipeline components. In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.</description>

      <title>The evolution of quantum battery capacity of GHZ-like states under Markovian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery has enormous potential for development, and quantum battery capacity is an important indicator of quantum battery. In this work, we mainly study the evolution of quantum battery capacity of GHZ state and GHZ-like states under Markovian channels in the tripartite system. We find that under the depolarizing channel and bit-phase flip channel, the battery capacity shows a brief sudden death of the capacity. And we also find that under the dephasing channel, the battery capacity gradually decreases and tends to a constant, that is, the frozen capacity. We show that the battery capacity monotonically decreases for GHZ state under the amplitude damping channel on the first subsystem. And we study the variation of capacity under the Markovian channels n times on the first subsystem using the GHZ state. We can observe that under the amplitude damping and dephasing channels, the battery capacity decreases and tends to a constant, i.e. frozen capacity, and the larger n, the earlier this phenomenon occurs. We also investigate the evolution of capacity under three independent same type Markovian channels. We have also conducted corresponding research on GHZ-like states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many physical settings, the statistical properties of quantum states are thought to be described by the Scrooge ensemble, a more structured generalization of the Haar ensemble. In this work, we prove several key results on the properties and complexity of Scrooge-random states in macroscopic quantum systems, and provide a general-purpose calculus for evaluating their moments. A key theme of our results is a separation between universal random fluctuations in non-local properties and exponential concentration of all local properties. Implications for device benchmarking, sampling advantages beyond random circuits, quantum complexity growth, and the physical origin of Scrooge-random states are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a numerical and experimental investigation of the collective early-time decay rates of a strongly driven and optically dense cold atomic cloud. We prepare the atomic ensemble by driving the system to its steady state with varying Rabi frequencies $\Omega$ that go from the weak $\Omega \ll \Gamma$ to the strong driving regime $\Omega \gg \Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is the single-atom decay rate. We investigate the early-time dynamics in the transition between the strong and weak driving regimes using: i) angular-dependent observables such as the light emitted by the cloud, and ii) global observables, i.e., the excited state population. When driving the cloud on-resonance, we find that as a function of the driving frequency, the behavior of the collected light at certain angles transitions from the single-photon subradiant regime to a superradiant regime while the behavior of the excited state population does not show superradiance. The experiment shows good agreement with numerical predictions in the regime of parameters under study.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Photonic Resonances in Spectroscopic Measurements of a Kerr Nonlinear Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr parametric oscillator (KPO) has recently attracted considerable attention from the perspective of its applications to quantum information processing, and understanding its properties is an important challenge. Spectroscopic measurements serve as an effective means of elucidating detailed information about the system, such as the energy-level structure and the transition matrix elements of the KPO. Conventional spectroscopy requires the drive frequency to match an energy spacing with a nonzero transition matrix element. In recent years, a phenomenon called photonic resonance (PR) has been theoretically predicted in KPO spectroscopy. Specifically, resonance occurs under the condition that the detuning is set to $n/2$ times the Kerr nonlinearity, where $n$ is a natural number. However, under this condition the transition matrix element vanishes, and thus the mechanism by which photonic resonance (PR) arises has remained unclear. In this work, we aim to elucidate the physical origin of PR observed in KPO spectroscopy. We first performed theoretical calculations and experiments of spectroscopic measurements, confirming that PR can indeed be observed and that the theoretical and experimental results are in qualitative agreement. We then carried out an analytical study under the assumption of an ideal noiseless environment. Our analysis revealed that, although the transition matrix element of the external field expressed in the system's energy eigenbasis is zero, higher-order perturbative effects induce Rabi oscillations between the ground and excited states. Furthermore, numerical simulations in a time domain including the effect of decoherence demonstrated that coherent oscillations decay, leading to the appearance of PR.</description>

      <title>Witnesses of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement and Nonlocal Measurement Back-action for Raman-scattering Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement between remote quantum mechanical systems enables a range of quantum information tasks in communication, computation and distributed sensing. Large numbers of entangled subsystems also require experimentally accessible and practically feasible methods of verifying the genuine, i.e., simultaneous, entanglement of all subsystems. We have derived a class of entanglement witnesses suitable for $W$-states, which are states where a single excitation is coherently distributed across subsystems initially in their ground state or a state with low thermal occupation, e.g., via detection of a Raman-scattered photon. The entanglement is witnessed through violation of an inequality involving number statistics, which can be measured via detection of subsequent Raman-scattered photons. Unlike conventional, partially tomographic, witnesses, our method is experimentally accessible for both multipartite and continuous variable systems. The thermal robustness of the method is quantified by the initial thermal occupations for which violation occurs. As an alternative approach, we have derived an inequality which tests the nonlocal, or quantum coherent, nature of the photon measurement backaction which produces the $W$-state. Violation of this alternative inequality implies the entanglement of the resulting state given the assumption of a separable initial state, under less stringent thermal constraints than the general entanglement witness. Our results are applicable to all Raman-scattering systems which can exhibit sufficient degrees of quantum indistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Is Bohmian mechanics missing some motion? Why a recent experiment is inconclusive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment raises a supposed challenge to Bohmian mechanics, claiming to observe stationary states, which should have zero Bohm velocity, while indirectly measuring a nonzero speed based on how an evanescent wavefunction spreads from one waveguide to another coupled waveguide. There were numerous problems this experiment and how it was interpreted. First, the experiment is not observing stationary states as claimed, but rather the time-averaged density of wave pulses which reflect off the potential step. Second, the proposed method for measuring a propagation speed is shown to be invalid for true stationary states. Third, the invalid method was misapplied to the time-averaged density, and this is shown to have created the false impression that it yields correct speed values for stationary states. These issues notwithstanding, for a wavefunction $\psi = Re^{iS/\hbar}$, the velocity of interest, $\vec{v}_s = -\frac{\hbar}{m}\frac{\vec{\nabla}R}{R}$, is different than the Bohm velocity $\vec{v}_B=\frac{1}{m}\vec{\nabla}S$, and may be nonzero for stationary states. So, even though we do not think this experiment makes a compelling case for it, if $\vec{v}_s$ is somehow associated with real physical motion, then this motion is indeed absent from Bohmian mechanics, as the authors contend. We discuss a generalized Madelung fluid model where this velocity is given physical meaning, and show how it roughly agrees with the authors' concept of an evanescent De Broglie speed.</description>

      <title>Phase-adjusted realification of a $\mathbb{C}^3$ Kochen-Specker configuration into $\mathbb{R}^6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a phase-adjusted realification procedure that embeds any finite set of rays in $\mathbb{C}^3$ into $\mathbb{R}^6$. By assigning an appropriate phase to each ray before applying the standard coordinate-wise map, we can arrange that two rays are orthogonal in $\mathbb{C}^3$ if and only if their images are orthogonal in $\mathbb{R}^6$, so the construction yields a faithful orthogonal representation of the original complex configuration. As a concrete example, we consider the 165 projectively distinct rays used in a $\mathbb{C}^3$ Kochen-Specker configuration obtained from mutually unbiased bases, list these 165 rays explicitly in $\mathbb{C}^3$, and give for each of them its image in $\mathbb{R}^6$ under the canonical realification map. We also note that, because the original 3-element contexts are no longer maximal in $\mathbb{R}^6$, the embedded configuration admits two-valued states even though its realisation with maximal contexts in $\mathbb{C}^3$ is Kochen-Specker uncolourable.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic preservation of plasticity in continual quantum learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence in dynamic, real-world environments requires the capacity for continual learning. However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners.</description>

      <title>Optical Entanglement Facilitated by Opto-Mechanical Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical generation of entangled optical beams is usually hindered by thermal noise. We present a theoretical study of low frequency entanglement generation between two optical harmonics emitted from a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved-sideband regime. The system comprises three nearly equidistant optical modes in a high-finesse cavity, with the central mode coherently driven. This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Basic cell for a quantum microwave router</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental realization of a scalable basic cell for quantum routing, enabling coherent control and exchange of microwave photons between two spatially separated superconducting waveguides coupled via a single transmon qubit. The cell was characterized at 10 mK with an average input signal of approximately 1 photon at approximately 6 GHz, and with the qubit biased to its optimal point to minimize sensitivity to external magnetic fluctuations. By combining steady-state and time-domain measurements, we reconstructed the key parameters of the system, including qubit relaxation and dephasing, waveguide-qubit couplings, and cross-waveguide photon transfer efficiency. The observed performance is consistent with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism and demonstrates clear limits set by flux bias, temperature, and photon number, in agreement with flux- and temperature-induced dephasing models. Crucially, the cell operates reliably at the single-photon level, and in the high-photon regime we directly observe photon dressing induced by the qubit. These results establish a versatile platform for studying open quantum system phenomena and pave the way for scalable implementations of quantum routing and network nodes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limitations of QAOA on Constrained Problems and a Route to Exponential Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fundamental limitations of the generic Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on constrained problems where valid solutions form a low dimensional manifold inside the Boolean hypercube, and we present a provable route to exponential improvements via constraint embedding. Focusing on permutation constrained objectives, we show that the standard generic QAOA ansatz, with a transverse field mixer and diagonal r local cost, faces an intrinsic feasibility bottleneck: even after angle optimization, circuits whose depth grows at most linearly with n cannot raise the total probability mass on the feasible manifold much above the uniform baseline suppressed by the size of the full Hilber space. Against this envelope we introduce a minimal constraint enhanced kernel (CE QAOA) that operates directly inside a product one hot subspace and mixes with a block local XY Hamiltonian. For permutation constrained problems, we prove an angle robust, depth matched exponential enhancement where the ratio between the feasible mass from CE QAOA and generic QAOA grows exponentially in $n^2$ for all depths up to a linear fraction of n, under a mild polynomial growth condition on the interaction hypergraph. Thanks to the problem algorithm co design in the kernel construction, the techniques and guarantees extend beyond permutations to a broad class of NP-Hard constrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Infrared Laser Dissociation of Molecules with the Electromagnetic Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling bond breaking is a long-standing goal in molecular physics. Infrared nanocavities are currently being developed for reaching exotic coupling regimes of cavity QED with a few molecules, but it is not well understood how chemical reactions would proceed in such systems. To address this, we study infrared laser photodissociation of a single CS$_{2}$ molecule with a stretching mode that strongly interacts with a resonant infrared vacuum, subject to a strong laser field that either resonantly drives the molecule at its fundamental vibration frequency or injects photons at the cavity resonance. We show that the intensities required for photodissociation are significantly lower inside the cavity than in free space, with a strong dependence on the type of driving condition. By directly injecting photons into the cavity, the molecule dissociates with two orders of magnitude less laser energy than by directly driving the vibrational mode. This photodissociation enhancement is a purely quantum mechanical effect that cannot be captured semi-classically. The intracavity ladder climbing dynamics is substantially modified relative to free space due to vacuum-induced admixing a large number of vibrational quantum numbers and the cavity field acting as a surrogate molecular mode that strongly interacts with the dissociative vibrational motion. Our work provides fundamental mechanistic understanding of chemical dynamics that can be used for designing new types of nanophotonics experiments that probe single-molecule chemistry.</description>

      <title>Optimal Thermalization under Indefinite Causal Order with Identical and Asymmetric Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indefinite causal order (ICO), in which the order of quantum operations is placed in a coherent superposition, has been demonstrated to enhance various information-processing tasks. Here, we investigate its impact on the thermodynamic processes generated by thermalizing quantum channels. We consider a two-level system interacting with two thermal baths under a quantum SWITCH, with the channel order controlled coherently by an ancillary qubit. We derive closed-form expressions for the effective inverse temperature $\beta_f$ of the postselected system state for both identical and distinct bath temperatures, and identify the control-qubit parameters that maximize heating or cooling. Our analysis reveals how the diagonal and coherent components of the control-qubit state contribute separately to the temperature shift, and how their interplay enables departures from the thermal response attainable under any fixed causal order. Bath asymmetry enhances these effects, while reduced purity of the control qubit state suppresses them. These results provide a systematic framework for assessing the thermodynamic capabilities of ICO and clarify the role of quantum coherence as a tunable thermodynamic resource.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of an entanglement transition in the projective transverse field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scalable and noise-resilient protocol for the detection of the entanglement transition in a projective version of the transverse field Ising model. Entanglement transitions are experimentally difficult to observe due to the inherent randomness of projective measurements and noise in large-scale experimental settings. Our approach combines error correction algorithms with classical shadow tomography to overcome both problems. This allows for experimentally accessible upper and lower bounds on the entanglement transition without postselection or full state tomography. These bounds remain robust under noise and their sharpness is a measure of the noise rate.</description>

      <title>Quantum Masked Autoencoders for Vision Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum computing and quantum autoencoders. In this paper, we propose quantum masked autoencoders (QMAEs) that can effectively learn missing features of a data sample within quantum states instead of classical embeddings. We showcase that our QMAE architecture can learn the masked features of an image and can reconstruct the masked input image with improved visual fidelity in MNIST images. Experimental evaluation highlights that QMAE can significantly outperform (12.86% on average) in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art quantum autoencoders in the presence of masks.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupling of optical vector vortices in coherently prepared media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of an optical vector vortex weakly interacting with a coherently prepared atomic medium (phaseonium) in a three-level $\Lambda$ configuration. The vector beam consists of vortex pulse pairs with right- and left-circular polarizations, corresponding to opposite spin angular momentum (SAM), and carrying opposite orbital angular momentum (OAM) charges $\pm l$. We show that during the propagation of the vortex pairs, analytically obtained in the linear regime, the medium inherits the topology of the vortex pair, mapping the OAM onto a spatially structured atomic coherence. This mapping produces $2|l|-$fold azimuthal transparency structures that reshape the beam intensity from a ring into a petal-like pattern. The OAM-structured atomic coherence induces a corresponding optical anisotropy within the medium, which feeds back into the propagating vector beam, resulting in optical spin-orbit coupling manifested as SAM exchange, rotation, and evolution of polarization textures. Depending on the initial ground-state population of the phaseonium, the polarization state evolves between left-circular, linear, and right-circular polarizations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage to non-computational states is a source of correlated errors in both time and space that limits the effectiveness of quantum error correction (QEC) with superconducting circuits. We present and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity, leakage reduction unit (LRU) operating concurrently with transmon measurement without incurring time overhead. Adapted from double-drive reset of population (DDROP), the protocol utilizes simultaneous drives on the transmon and its readout resonator, leveraging the dispersive shift to create a directional process that returns the transmon to the computational subspace. The LRU achieves a 98.4% leakage removal fraction without compromising the computational-state assignment fidelity (99.2%). We combine LRU-enhanced measurement and neural-network decoding to successfully suppress logical error rates in both memory and stability QEC experiments without any post-selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to determining the Hamiltonian eigenstates. The algorithm is first benchmarked on random Hamiltonians acting on two and three qubits and then applied to many-body systems of up to six qubits, including the transverse-field Ising model and the all-to-all pairing Hamiltonian. In both cases, the algorithm is demonstrated to perform successfully; in the pairing model, it can also reveal hidden symmetries, which can be exploited to restrict learning to specific symmetry sectors. Finally, we discuss the possibility of post-selecting high-fidelity states even when full convergence has not been reached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a momentum-space based variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework for simulating quasiparticle excitations in interacting quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum devices. Leveraging translational invariance and other symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we reconstruct the momentum-resolved quasiparticle excitation spectrum through targeted simulation of low-lying excited states using VQE. We construct a translationally symmetric variational ansatz designed to evolve a free-fermion particle-hole excited state with definite momentum $q$ to an excited state of the interacting system at the same momentum, employing a fermionic fast Fourier transform (FFFT) circuit coupled to a Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) circuit. Even though the particle number is not explicitly conserved in the variational ansatz, the correct quasiparticle state is reached by energetic optimization. We benchmark the performance of the proposed VQE implementation on the XXZ Hamiltonian, which maps onto the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid in the fermionic representation. Our numerical results show that VQE can capture the low-lying excitation spectrum of the bosonic quasiparticle/two-spinon dispersion of this model at various interaction strengths. We estimate the renormalized velocity of the quasiparticles by calculating the slope of the dispersion near zero momentum using the VQE-optimized energies at different system sizes, and demonstrate that it closely matches theoretical results obtained from Bethe ansatz. Finally, we highlight extensions of our proposed VQE implementation to simulate quasiparticles in other interacting quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the real-time dynamics of multi-party entanglement signals in chaotic quantum many-body systems including but not necessarily restricted to holographic conformal field theories. We find that scrambling dynamics generates multiparty entanglement with rich structure including: (a) qualitatively different dynamical behaviours for different signals, likely reflecting different dynamics for different kinds of entanglement patterns, (b) discontinuities indicating dynamical phase transitions in the entanglement structure, (c) transient and non-monotonic multiparty entanglement, and (d) periods during which the extensive entanglement of some regions is entirely multipartite. Our main technical tool is the membrane theory of entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems far from thermal equilibrium can exhibit remarkable physical phenomena including topological properties without a direct equilibrium counterpart. Along these lines, in periodically driven dissipative systems within the effective non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian approximation spectral winding numbers have been linked to intriguing nonreciprocal transport properties. Here, going beyond an NH Hamiltonian description, we introduce and study a microscopic lattice model of a driven open quantum system described by a Markovian quantum master equation, which exhibits the mentioned spectral winding within a NH approximation. By encompassing quantum jump processes in the topological analysis, we uncover a distinct \emph{jump-induced} topological phase, which qualitatively corresponds to the richer non-reciprocal transport properties of the fully quantum model. In addition, we find that the NH skin effect, i.e.~the accumulation of a macroscopic number of eigenstates at one end of the system, is already visible in the transient dynamics even for systems with periodic boundary conditions. Our results exemplify the subtle correspondence between NH topological properties and physical manifestations of Liouvillian topological properties in open quantum systems, thus providing a theoretical framework towards understanding unidirectional transport in quantum dissipative Floquet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Excited states from local effective Hamiltonians of matrix product states and their entanglement spectrum transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving excited states is a challenging task for interacting systems. For one-dimensional critical systems, however, excited states can be directly accessed from the eigenvectors of the local effective Hamiltonian that is constructed from the ground state obtained by variational matrix product state (MPS) optimization. Despite its numerical success, the theoretical mechanism underlying this method has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we provide a conformal field theory (CFT) perspective that helps elucidate this connection. The key insight is that this construction effectively uses a truncated basis of ground-state Schmidt vectors to represent excited states, where the contribution of each Schmidt vector can be expressed as a CFT correlation function and shown to decay with increasing Schmidt index. The CFT analysis further predicts an entanglement-spectrum transition of excited states as the ratio of the subsystem size to the total system size is varied. Our numerical results support this picture and demonstrate a reorganization of the entanglement spectrum into distinct conformal towers as this ratio changes.</description>

      <title>Numerical tiling-based simulations of decoherence in multifield models of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we developed a method for computing two-point correlators by decomposing the mode degrees of freedom into fast and slow components. Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating.</description>

      <title>Broadband telecom single-photon emissions from InAs/InP quantum dots grown by MOVPE droplet epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications.</description>

      <title>Exponentially enhanced sensing through nonreciprocal light propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocity is a key resource for pushing the performance of photonic devices beyond the fundamental limits imposed by Lorentz reciprocity. Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Jump Approach for Photosynthetic Energy Transfer with Chemical Reaction and Fluorescence Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the coherent modified Redfield theory (CMRT) has been widely used to simulate the excitation-energy-transfer (EET) processes in photosynthetic systems. However, the numerical simulation of the CMRT is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale systems, e.g. photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII). On the other hand, the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss traditionally treated by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian approach may result in significantly error in a wide range of parameters. To address these issues, we introduce a quantum jump approach (QJA) based on the CMRT to simulate the evolution of photosynthetic complexes including both the chemical reaction and fluorescence loss. The QJA shows higher accuracy and efficiency in simulating the EET processes. The QJA-CMRT approach may provide a powerful tool to design and optimize artificial photosynthetic systems, which benefits future innovation in the field of energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate scattering phenomena in a one-dimensional attractive Bose-Hubbard model with a time-periodically modulated impurity. We analyze both single-particle and pair (doublon) transmission, exploring a range of interaction strengths and drive amplitudes. Our exact numerical results reveal excellent quantitative agreement with analytical predictions in the high-frequency limit. At intermediate and weak attractive interactions, we observe significant pair dissociation and the emergence of dynamically localized single-particle modes. These features are reminiscent of Floquet Bound States in the Continuum (BICs). These findings provide new avenues for engineering controllable quantum transport and localized states in ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Exceptional line and pseudospectrum in black hole spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) and their pseudospectra in black hole perturbation theory. By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.</description>

      <title>Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</description>

      <title>Teaching quantum computing to computer science students: Review of a hands-on quantum circuit simulation practical</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a practical course targeting graduate students with prior knowledge of the basics of quantum computing. The practical aims to deepen students' understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing by implementing quantum circuit simulators. Through hands-on experience, students learn about different methods to simulate quantum computing, including state vectors, density matrices, the stabilizer formalism, and matrix product states. By implementing the simulation methods themselves, students develop a more in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts in quantum computing, including superposition, entanglement, and the effects of noise on quantum systems. This hands-on experience prepares students to do research in the field of quantum computing and equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to tackle complex research projects in the field. In this work, we describe our teaching approach and the structure of our practical, and we discuss evaluations and lessons learned.</description>

      <title>A Lifting Theorem for Hybrid Classical-Quantum Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigates a model of hybrid classical-quantum communication complexity, in which two parties first exchange classical messages and subsequently communicate using quantum messages. We study the trade-off between the classical and quantum communication for composed functions of the form $f\circ G^n$, where $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{\pm1\}$ and $G$ is an inner product function of $\Theta(\log n)$ bits. To prove the trade-off, we establish a novel lifting theorem for hybrid communication complexity. This theorem unifies two previously separate lifting paradigms: the query-to-communication lifting framework for classical communication complexity and the approximate-degree-to-generalized-discrepancy lifting methods for quantum communication complexity. Our hybrid lifting theorem therefore offers a new framework for proving lower bounds in hybrid classical-quantum communication models.
  As a corollary, we show that any hybrid protocol communicating $c$ classical bits followed by $q$ qubits to compute $f\circ G^n$ must satisfy $c+q^2=\Omega\big(\max\{\mathrm{deg}(f),\mathrm{bs}(f)\}\cdot\log n\big)$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ and $\mathrm{bs}(f)$ is the block sensitivity of $f$. For read-once formula $f$, this yields an almost tight trade-off: either they have to exchange $\Theta\big(n\cdot\log n\big)$ classical bits or $\widetilde\Theta\big(\sqrt n\cdot\log n\big)$ qubits, showing that classical pre-processing cannot significantly reduce the quantum communication required. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial trade-off between classical and quantum communication in hybrid two-way communication complexity.</description>

Abstract: We develop a geometric description of quantum light in photonic time crystals on the SU(1,1) coherent-state manifold. In a projective picture, the evolution of each mode appears as a M\"obius isometry on the Poincar\'e disk, where topologies of trajectories distinguish stable, unstable, and critical regimes. The geometric phase is related to the hyperbolic area enclosed by cyclic paths in the complex projective Hilbert space. This framework offers an intuitive view of stability and topology in quantum photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>Parameter Inference from Final-State Entanglement in Higgs Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay out-states of unstable Standard Model (SM) particles provide a unique, well-defined intrinsic quantum-information probe of the SM parameter space. We use Higgs decays as a test case: after tracing out kinematics, we compute entanglement among final-state spins and colors across all decay channels and impose a near-maximal entanglement-entropy criterion. This criterion yields quantitative indications for fundamental parameters. Within the SM, the entanglement entropy exhibits a global maximum close to the observed Higgs mass and the measured $W$ mass, the latter being equivalent to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge coupling. In a two-parameter kappa framework, applying the same criterion points to an SM-like balance between vector and fermion couplings, constraining the ratio of the sector-wide rescalings. These results suggest that entanglement extremality can serve as a complementary handle on fundamental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local approach: examining entanglement between pairs of field modes compactly supported within de Sitter's cosmological patch. Our approach is formulated in terms of the properties of a metric tensor and an associated complex structure induced by the Bunch-Davies vacuum on the classical phase space. We find that increasing curvature increases correlations between local modes but, somewhat counterintuitively, decreases their entanglement. Our methods allow us to characterize how entanglement is spatially distributed, revealing that a cosmological constant, even if tiny, qualitatively alters the vacuum's entanglement structure. We show that our results are compatible with previous entropy-based studies when properly interpreted. Our findings have implications for entanglement between observables generated during cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Measuring Anyonic Exchange Phases Using Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying experimental signatures of anyons, which exhibit fractional exchange statistics, remains a central challenge in the study of two-dimensional topologically ordered systems. Previous theoretical work has shown that the threshold behavior in linear response spectroscopy can reveal the fractional exchange statistics between an anyon and its antiparticle. In this work, we extend this framework to nonlinear, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy. We demonstrate by analyzing time-ordered four-point correlation functions that the threshold behavior of nonlinear response functions encodes the fractional statistics between general pairs of anyons that can combine to any composite topological charge. This feature in particular provides a powerful probe for unambiguously distinguishing non-Abelian anyons, which can form multiple composite charges with distinct nontrivial braid statistics. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations that are consistent with the correct fractional exchange statistics for both the Abelian anyons in the toric code and non-Abelian Ising anyons.</description>

Abstract: We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of a discrete subgroup of $SU(3)$: the 216-element $\Sigma(72\times3)$. The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, for which we provide qubit decompositions. The resulting fault-tolerant T gate costs for a fiducial calculation of shear viscosity would require about $10^{12}$ T gates which compares favorably to other modern estimates.</description>

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbations in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicates that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern insulator edges: crystalline effects and optical measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge states of chiral topologically ordered phases are commonly described by chiral Luttinger liquids, effective theories that are exact only in the hydrodynamic limit. Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limit due to lattice effects. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we disentangle universal from nonuniversal edge properties. We outline experimental probes in excitonic FCIs and in ultracold atom systems, and in particular propose time-resolved edge spectroscopy to directly access the predicted exponents and velocities.</description>

      <title>Toward Super-polynomial Quantum Speedup of Equivariant Quantum Algorithms with SU($d$) Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.07250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework of the equivariant convolutional quantum algorithms which is tailored for a number of machine-learning tasks on physical systems with arbitrary SU$(d)$ symmetries. It allows us to enhance a natural model of quantum computation -- permutational quantum computing (PQC) -- and define a more powerful model: PQC+. While PQC was shown to be efficiently classically simulatable, we exhibit a problem which can be efficiently solved on PQC+ machine, whereas no classical polynomial time algorithm is known; thus providing evidence against PQC+ being classically simulatable. We further discuss practical quantum machine learning algorithms which can be carried out in the paradigm of PQC+.</description>

      <title>Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Partial independence suffices to rule out Real Quantum Theory experimentally</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of complex quantities in quantum theory has been puzzling physicists since the beginnings. It is thus natural to ask whether, in order to describe our experiments, the mathematical structure of complex Hilbert spaces it is built on is really necessary. Recently, it was shown that this structure is inevitable in network scenarios with independent sources. More precisely, Real Quantum Theory cannot explain the predictions of (Complex) Quantum Theory [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Here, we revisit the independence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial independence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of Real Quantum Theory. We derive a tradeoff between source independence and the Bell value achievable in Real Quantum Theory, which also lower bounds the source correlations required to explain previous experiments by means of real quantum systems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient for recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of Real Quantum Theory in the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Finally, building on [McKague et al., PRL 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any complex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of Real Quantum Theory, by allowing the sources to share a m real-qubit entangled state in the first round of the experiment.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The irreversibility and thermalization of many-body systems can be attributed to the erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information by local operations. This thermalization mechanism can be demonstrated by the sequence of $\hat{O}_i(t_i)$, where $\hat{O_i}$ is a local operator, $\hat{O_i}(t_i) = e^{i\hat{H}t_i} \hat{O_i} e^{-i\hat{H}t_i}$, $\hat{H}$ is the system Hamiltonian, $t_i$ can take positive, negative, or zero values, and the sequence is arranged according to the subscript $i$. We numerically demonstrate the information erasure of initial non-equilibrium quantum states through such sequence in a one-dimensional Hubbard model. During this process, the system's entanglement entropy increases monotonically toward a stable value. By incorporating this information erasure mechanism into an isolated system, our numerical simulations reveal that in this completely isolated system, a thermalization process emerges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using time-resolved infrared-vacuum-ultraviolet double-resonance spectroscopy, experimental room temperature measurements of state-to-state rate coefficients for rotational energy transfer within the X $^1\Sigma^+(v=2)$ vibrational state of CO due to H$_2$ collisions have been compared to accurate 4-D close-coupling quantum calculations. Theoretically predicted quantum interferences in the CO-H$_2$ collisional system are experimentally observed for the first time at room temperature, and excellent agreement between theory and experiment is observed. These results provide a valuable benchmark for validating the anisotropic part of the potential energy surface, thereby supporting the theoretical modeling of CO emission in warm astrophysical environments such as photodissociation regions.</description>

      <title>Pareto-optimality of pulses for robust population transfer in a ladder-type qutrit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-modulation schemes offer an alternative to standard Rabi pulses for realizing robust quantum operations. In this work, we investigate short-duration population transfer between the ground and first excited states of a ladder-type qutrit, with the goal of minimizing leakage into the second excited state. Our multiobjective approach seeks to reduce the maximum transient second-state population and maximize detuning robustness. Inspired by two-state models -- such as the Allen-Eberly and Hioe-Carroll models -- we extend these concepts to our system, exploring a range of pulse families, including those with super-Gaussian envelopes and polynomial detuning functions. We identify Pareto fronts for pulse models constructed from one of two envelope functions paired with one of four detuning functions. We then analyze how each Pareto-optimal pulse parameter influences the two Pareto objectives as well as amplitude robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forthcoming quantum devices will require high-fidelity information transfer across a many-body system. We formulate the criterion for lossless signal propagation and show that a single qubit can play the role of an antenna, collecting large amounts of information from a complex system. We derive the condition under which the antenna, far from the source and embedded in a many-body interacting medium, can still collect the complete information. A striking feature of this setup is that a single qubit antenna can receive even the full signal amplified by the entanglement of the source. As a consequence, the recovery of this information can be performed with simple single-qubit operations on the antenna (which we fully characterize) rather than with multi-qubit measurements of the source. Finally, we discuss the control of the system parameters necessary for lossless signal propagation. A method discussed here could improve the precision of quantum devices and simplify metrological protocols.</description>

Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha&gt;D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Koteck\'y and Preiss.</description>

Abstract: The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for a typical macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In typical macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is inevitable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The verification of quantum entanglement is essential for quality control in quantum communication. In this work, we propose an efficient protocol to directly verify the two-qubit entanglement of a known target state through a single expectation value measurement. Our method provides exact entanglement quantification using the currencence measure without performing quantum state tomography. We prove the existence of a unitary transformation that drives the initial state of a two-qubit system to a designated final state, where the trace over a chosen observable directly yields the concurrence of the initial state. Furthermore, we implement an optimal control process of that transformation and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical simulations. We also show that this process is robust to environmental noise. Our approach offers advantages in directly verifying entanglement with low circuit depth, making it suitable for industrial-scale quality control of entanglement generation. Our results, presented here, provide mathematical justification for our earlier computational experiments.</description>

Abstract: The study of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics remains one of the most exciting research frontiers of physics, standing at the crossroads of our understanding of complex quantum phenomena and the realization of quantum advantage. Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to $30 \times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of hardware-friendly ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Spin-Mediated Relaxation Mechanisms of the V$_{B}^-$ Center in hBN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy $V_B^-$ defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently emerged as a promising spin qubit for sensing due to its high-temperature spin control and versatile integration into van der Waals structures. While extensive experiments have explored their coherence properties, much less is known about the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and its control-parameter dependence. In this work, we develop a parameter-free spin dynamics model based on the cluster-expansion technique to investigate $T_1$ relaxation mechanisms at low temperature. Our results reveal that the $V_B^-$ center constitutes a strongly coupled electron spin-nuclear spin core, which necessitates the inclusion of the coherent dynamics and derived memory effects of the three nearest-neighbor nitrogen nuclear spins. Using this framework, this work closely reproduces the experimentally observed $T_1$ time at $B = 90\,\mathrm{G}$ and further predicts the $T_1$ dependence on external magnetic field in the $0 \le B \le 2000\,\mathrm{G}$ interval, when the spin relaxation is predominantly driven by electron-nuclear and nuclear-nuclear flip-flop processes mediated by hyperfine and dipolar interactions. This study establishes a reliable and scalable approach for describing $T_1$ relaxation in $V_B^-$ centers and offers microscopic insights to support future developments in nuclear-spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Universal quantum computing requires the ability to perform every unitary operation, i.e., evolution operator controllability. In view of developing resource-efficient quantum processing units (QPUs), it is important to determine how many local controls and qubit-qubit couplings are required for controllability. Unfortunately, assessing the controllability of large qubit arrays is a difficult task, due to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space dimension. Here we show that it is sufficient to connect two qubit arrays that are evolution operator controllable by a single entangling two-qubit gate in order to obtain a composite qubit array that is evolution operator controllable. The proof provides a template to build up modular QPUs from smaller building blocks with reduced numbers of local controls and couplings. We illustrate the approach with two examples, consisting of 10, respectively 127 qubits, inspired by IBM quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Extended Kalman Smoothing of Free Spin Precession Signals for Accurate Magnetic Field Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel application of the Extended Kalman Smoother (EKS) for highly accurate frequency estimation from free spin precession signals of polarized $^3$He. Traditional approaches often rely on nonlinear least-squares fitting, which can suffer from limited robustness to signal decay and time-dependent frequency shifts. By contrast, our EKS-based method captures both amplitude and frequency variations with minimal tuning, adapting automatically to fluctuations via an expectation-maximization algorithm.
  We benchmark the technique in extensive simulations that emulate realistic spin precession signals with exponentially decaying amplitudes and noisy frequency drifts. Compared to least-squares fits with fixed block lengths, EKS systematically reduces estimation errors, particularly when frequencies evolve or signal-to-noise ratios are moderate to high. We further validate these findings with experimental data from a free-precession decay $^3$He magnetometer.
  Our results indicate that EKS-based analysis can substantially improve precision in nuclear magnetic resonance-based magnetometry, where accurate frequency estimation underpins absolute field determinations. This versatile approach promises to enhance the stability and accuracy of future highly accurate measurements.</description>

      <title>Complexity in multi-qubit and many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing complexity and criticality in quantum systems requires diagnostics that are both computationally tractable and physically insightful. We introduce a measure of quantum state complexity for n-qubit systems, defined as the divergence between the Shannon or von Neumann entropy of the computational basis distribution and the second-order R\'enyi entropy. This quantity is particularly powerful as the latter R\'enyi entropy is directly related to state purity, linear entropy, and the inverse participation ratio, providing a clear physical grounding. While other R\'enyi orders could be used, the second order offers a deep and established connection to these key physical quantities. We first validate the measure in canonical noise channels, showing it peaks at the boundary between quantum and classical regimes. We then demonstrate its power in many-body physics. For systems exhibiting a many-body localization transition - including deformed random matrix ensembles and a disordered Heisenberg spin chain - the complexity measure reliably signals the crossover from integrable/localized to quantum-chaotic/ergodic phases. Crucially, the maximum complexity occurs in the non-ergodic yet extended states at the transition, precisely capturing the critical region where the system is neither fully localized nor thermalized. Furthermore, within the chaotic phase, the measure correlates with the survival probability of local excitations, revealing a spectrum of thermalization properties. Our results establish that the entropic complexity is a simple, versatile, and effective probe for identifying nontrivial quantum regimes and transitions giving a new and alternative insight into such systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Monte Carlo Calculations with Set-Equivariant Architectures and Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) ans\"atze have greatly expanded the accuracy and reach of variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations, in particular when exploring the manifold quantum phenomena exhibited by spin systems. However, the scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and specifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on random deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the set-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even bypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the magnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples structured around quantum spin systems with long-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict observables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we show how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by reusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes.</description>

      <title>Learning to Restore Heisenberg Limit in Noisy Quantum Sensing via Quantum Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensors leverage nonclassical resources to achieve sensing precision at the Heisenberg limit, surpassing the standard quantum limit attainable through classical strategies. However, a critical issue is that the environmental noise induces rapid decoherence, fundamentally limiting the realizability of the Heisenberg limit. In this Letter, we propose a quantum digital twin protocol to overcome this issue. The protocol first establishes observable-constrained state reconstruction to infer random errors in the decoherence process, and then utilizes reinforcement learning to derive adaptive compensatory control strategies. Demonstrated across discrete, continuous variable and multi-qubit circuit systems, our approach bypasses quantum state tomography's exponential overhead and discovers optimal control schemes to restore the Heisenberg limit. Unlike quantum error correction or mitigation schemes requiring precise noise characterization and ancillary qubits, our autonomous protocol achieves noise-resilient sensing through environment-adaptive control sequencing. This work establishes quantum digital twin as a generic methodology for quantum control, proposing a noise-immune paradigm for next-generation quantum sensors compatible with NISQ-era experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Qumode-Based Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Molecular Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Qumode Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver (QSS-VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for computing molecular excited states using the Fock basis of bosonic qumodes in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) devices. This approach harnesses the native universal gate sets of qubit-qumode architectures to construct highly expressive variational ansatze, offering potential advantages over conventional qubit-based methods. In QSS-VQE, the electronic structure Hamiltonian is first mapped to a qubit representation and subsequently embedded into the Fock space of bosonic qumodes, enabling efficient state preparation and reduced quantum resource requirements. We demonstrate the performance of QSS-VQE through simulations of molecular excited states, including dihydrogen and a conical intersection in cytosine. Additionally, we explore a bosonic model Hamiltonian to assess the expressivity of qumode gates, identifying regimes where qumode-based implementations outperform purely qubit-based approaches. These results highlight the promise of leveraging bosonic degrees of freedom for enhanced quantum simulation of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum optics in the turbulent atmosphere: Fundamental issues and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.</description>

      <title>MAQCY: Modular Atom-Array Quantum Computing with Space-Time Hybrid Multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modular atom-array quantum computing architecture with space-time hybrid multiplexing (MAQCY), a dynamic optical tweezer-based protocol for fully connected and scalable universal quantum computation. By extending the concept of globally controlled static dual-species Rydberg atom wires [1], we develop an entirely new approach using Q-Pairs, which consist of globally controlled and temporally multiplexed dual-species Rydberg blockaded atom and superatom pairs. Space-time hybrid multiplexing of Q-Pairs achieves O(N) linear scaling in the number of required physical qubits, while preserving coherence and mitigating circuit-depth limitations through in-situ atom replacement. To demonstrate MAQCY's versatility, we implement a three-qubit quantum Fourier transform using only global operations and atom transport. We also propose a concrete implementation using ytterbium isotopes, paving the way toward large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Graph theoretic quantum contextuality and unextendible Product Bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unextendible product bases(UPBs) are central to the study of local distinguishability of orthogonal product states. While their connection to quantum nonlocality via Bell inequalities is well established, their link to quantum contextuality remains largely unexplored. We establish a graph theoretic connection between contextuality and UPBs. First, an equivalence between Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) vectors and the Pyramid UPB is shown and then by constructing a one parameter family of UPB vectors, a quantitative connection between `contextuality strength' and bound entanglement of states associated with the corresponding UPB is demonstrated. This equivalence is extended to generalized KCBS vectors and the GenPyramid UPB. A new class of minimal UPBs in $\mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ is constructed using Lov\'asz-optimal orthogonal representations (LOORs) of cycle graphs and their complements which we term the GenContextual UPB. Any minimal UPB in this dimension is shown to be graph-equivalent to the GenContextual UPB. We briefly discuss the distinguishability properties of GenContextual UPB. In the reverse direction, we observe that the constituent vectors of the QuadRes UPB are LOORs of Paley graphs. The structural properties of these graphs make them suitable candidates for constructing noncontextuality inequalities, thereby establishing a bidirectional connection between quantum contextuality and UPBs.</description>

      <title>From single-particle to many-body chaos in Yukawa--SYK: theory and a cavity-QED proposal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how quantum systems transition from integrable to fully chaotic behavior remains a central open problem in physics. The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model provides a paradigmatic framework for studying many-body chaos and holography, yet it captures only the strongly correlated limit, leaving intermediate regimes unexplored. Here, we investigate the Yukawa--SYK (YSYK) model, where bosonic fields mediate random fermionic interactions, and demonstrate that it naturally bridges single-particle and many-body chaos. Using spectral and dynamical chaos markers, we perform a comprehensive finite-size characterization of the YSYK model. We show that the interaction strength acts as a tunable control parameter interpolating between the SYK$_2$ and SYK$_4$ limits, and introduce a framework enabling direct and quantitative comparison with these benchmark models. In the intermediate regimes, we uncover distinct dynamical regimes marked by partial ergodicity breaking, prethermalization plateaus, and incomplete scrambling. Finally, we propose a feasible optical-cavity implementation of the YSYK model using ultra-cold atoms. Our results establish the YSYK model as a unifying platform connecting single-particle and many-body chaos, paving the way for experimental observation of these phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate channel-selective frequency up-conversion from telecom wavelengths around 1540 nm for optical fiber communication to visible wavelengths around 780 nm, based on second-order optical nonlinearity in a cavity of the converted modes. In our experiment, we selectively convert a light from any frequency mode within frequency-multiplexed telecom signals to a desired output mode, determined by the cavity resonances. Based on the experimental results of the frequency up-conversion, we derive the signal-to-noise ratio of the process at the single-photon level, and discuss its applicability to channel-selective quantum frequency conversion (CS-QFC) in the context of frequency-multiplexed quantum networks. Finally, we describe specific use cases of the CS-QFC, which show its utility as a reconfigurable switching element in frequency-multiplexed networks, particularly for selectively performing Bell-state measurements between two photons originating from different frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A qubit sensor with an electric dipole moment acquires an additional contribution to its depolarization rate when it is placed in the vicinity of a polar or dielectric material as a consequence of electrical noise arising from polarization fluctuations in the latter. Here, we characterize this relaxation rate as a function of experimentally tunable parameters such as sample-probe distance, probe-frequency, and temperature, and demonstrate that it offers a window into dielectric properties of insulating materials over a wide range of frequencies and length scales. We discuss the experimental feasibility of our proposal and illustrate its ability to probe a variety of phenomena, ranging from collective polar excitations to phase transitions and disorder-dominated physics in relaxor ferroelectrics. Our proposal paves the way for a novel table-top probe of polar and dielectric materials in a parameter regime complementary to existing tools and techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The macroscopic energy-momentum and spin densities of relativistic spin hydrodynamics are obtained from the ensemble average of their respective microscopic definitions (quantum operators). These microscopic definitions suffer from ambiguities, meaning that one may obtain different forms of symmetric energy-momentum tensor and spin tensor through pseudogauge transformations (or, in other words, Belinfante improvement procedure). However, this ambiguity may be fixed if we obtain these currents using Noether's second theorem instead of widely used Noether's first theorem. The second theorem fixes the super-potential determined by local symmetry, thereby selecting a unique physically consistent pseudogauge. In this article, we use Noether's second theorem to derive energy-momentum and spin currents without the need of pseudogauge transformations for free Dirac massive particles with spin one-half.</description>

      <title>On the Schr\"odingerization method for linear non-unitary dynamics with optimal dependence on matrix queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerization method converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schr\"odinger-type equations with unitary evolution. It does so via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the original equation into a Schr\"odinger-type equation in one higher dimension \cite{Schrshort,JLY22SchrLong}. The original proposal used a particular initial function in the auxiliary space that did not achieve optimal scaling in precision. Here we show that, by choosing smoother initial functions in auxiliary space, Schr\"odingerization \textit{can} in fact achieve near optimal and even optimal scaling in matrix queries. We construct three necessary criteria that the initial auxiliary state must satisfy to achieve optimality. This paper presents detailed implementation of four smooth initializations for the Schr\"odingerization method: (a) the error function and related functions, (b) the cut-off function, (c) the higher-order polynomial interpolation, and (d) Fourier transform methods. Method (a) achieves optimality and methods (b), (c) and (d) can achieve near-optimality. A detailed analysis of key parameters affecting time complexity is conducted.</description>

Abstract: The singularities prevalent in classical thermodynamics largely stem from the "postulate of equal a priori probabilities" neglecting the physical constraints imposed by computational complexity. This paper introduces Complexity Window Thermodynamics (CWT), a framework that characterizes the observer's "ignorance" via a finite complexity budget, thereby naturally smoothing out singular behaviors associated with phase transitions and negative temperatures within this window. We derive a generalized First Law of Thermodynamics driven by a complexity generation potential, which incorporates "information processing work," and demonstrate a universal action-time bound constraining the growth of complexity. CWT not only offers a unified perspective on critical phenomena in condensed matter and the black hole information problem but also suggests that the total generatable complexity of the universe is comparable in order of magnitude to its holographic entropy. Thus, it paves a new pathway for a resource-theoretic unification of thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Husimi Representation of Chaotic Resonance States: Invariance and Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For chaotic scattering systems we investigate the left-right Husimi representation, which combines left and right resonance states. We demonstrate that the left-right Husimi representation is invariant in the semiclassical limit under the corresponding closed classical dynamics, which we call quantum invariance. Furthermore, we show that it factorizes into a classical multifractal structure times universal quantum fluctuations. Numerical results for a dielectric cavity, the three-disk scattering system, and quantum maps confirm both the quantum invariance and the factorization.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy, dihedral invariants and Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-invariants are local-unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for Lifshitz groundstates, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of R\'enyi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity, a relation that also holds for stabilizer states. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are related to R\'enyi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</description>

      <title>Axiomatising the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We axiomatise the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps, using exclusively purely categorical conditions. Our axioms are chosen with the aim of an easy interpretability: two of them describe the composition of objecs, two further ones deal with the decomposition of objects, and a final axiom expresses a symmetry property.
  The categorical reconstruction of complex Hilbert spaces addresses foundational issues in quantum physics. We present a simplified alternative to recent characterisations.</description>
