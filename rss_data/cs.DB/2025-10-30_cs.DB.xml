      <title>ODataX: A Progressive Evolution of the Open Data Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Data Protocol (OData) provides a standardized approach for building and consuming RESTful APIs with rich query capabilities. Despite its power and maturity, OData adoption remains confined primarily to enterprise environments, particularly within Microsoft and SAP ecosystems. This paper analyzes the key barriers preventing wider OData adoption and introduces ODataX, an evolved version of the protocol designed to address these limitations. ODataX maintains backward compatibility with OData v4 while introducing progressive complexity disclosure through simplified query syntax, built-in performance guardrails via query cost estimation, and enhanced caching mechanisms. This work aims to bridge the gap between enterprise-grade query standardization and the simplicity demanded by modern web development practices.</description>

      <title>StorageXTuner: An LLM Agent-Driven Automatic Tuning Framework for Heterogeneous Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically configuring storage systems is hard: parameter spaces are large and conditions vary across workloads, deployments, and versions. Heuristic and ML tuners are often system specific, require manual glue, and degrade under changes. Recent LLM-based approaches help but usually treat tuning as a single-shot, system-specific task, which limits cross-system reuse, constrains exploration, and weakens validation. We present StorageXTuner, an LLM agent-driven auto-tuning framework for heterogeneous storage engines. StorageXTuner separates concerns across four agents - Executor (sandboxed benchmarking), Extractor (performance digest), Searcher (insight-guided configuration exploration), and Reflector (insight generation and management). The design couples an insight-driven tree search with layered memory that promotes empirically validated insights and employs lightweight checkers to guard against unsafe actions. We implement a prototype and evaluate it on RocksDB, LevelDB, CacheLib, and MySQL InnoDB with YCSB, MixGraph, and TPC-H/C. Relative to out-of-the-box settings and to ELMo-Tune, StorageXTuner reaches up to 575% and 111% higher throughput, reduces p99 latency by as much as 88% and 56%, and converges with fewer trials.</description>

      <title>Time-varying Vector Field Compression with Preserved Critical Point Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific simulations and observations are producing vast amounts of time-varying vector field data, making it hard to store them for archival purposes and transmit them for analysis. Lossy compression is considered a promising approach to reducing these data because lossless compression yields low compression ratios that barely mitigate the problem. However, directly applying existing lossy compression methods to timevarying vector fields may introduce undesired distortions in critical-point trajectories, a crucial feature that encodes key properties of the vector field. In this work, we propose an efficient lossy compression framework that exactly preserves all critical-point trajectories in time-varying vector fields. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the theory for preserving critical points in space to preserving critical-point trajectories in space-time, and develop a compression framework to realize the functionality. Second, we propose a semi-Lagrange predictor to exploit the spatiotemporal correlations in advectiondominated regions, and combine it with the traditional Lorenzo predictor for improved compression efficiency. Third, we evaluate our method against state-of-the-art lossy and lossless compressors using four real-world scientific datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers up to 124.48X compression ratios while effectively preserving all critical-point trajectories. This compression ratio is up to 56.07X higher than that of the best lossless compressors, and none of the existing lossy compressors can preserve all critical-point trajectories at similar compression ratios.</description>

      <title>DGAI: Decoupled On-Disk Graph-Based ANN Index for Efficient Updates and Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-disk graph-based indexes are widely used in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search systems for large-scale, high-dimensional vectors. However, traditional coupled storage methods, which store vectors within the index, are inefficient for index updates. Coupled storage incurs excessive redundant vector reads and writes when updating the graph topology, leading to significant invalid I/O. To address this issue, we propose a decoupled storage architecture. While a decoupled architecture reduces query performance. To overcome this limitation, we design two tailored strategies: (i) a three-stage query mechanism that leverages multiple PQ compressed vectors to filter invalid I/O and computations, and (ii) an incremental page-level topological reordering strategy that incrementally inserts new nodes into pages containing their most similar neighbors to mitigate read amplification. Together, these techniques substantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search. Experimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed by 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query and incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the traditional coupled architecture.</description>

      <title>One Join Order Does Not Fit All: Reducing Intermediate Results with Per-Split Query Plans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizing intermediate results is critical for efficient multi-join query processing. Although the seminal Yannakakis algorithm offers strong guarantees for acyclic queries, cyclic queries remain an open challenge. In this paper, we propose SplitJoin, a framework that introduces split as a first-class query operator. By partitioning input tables into heavy and light parts, SplitJoin allows different data partitions to use distinct query plans, with the goal of reducing intermediate sizes using existing binary join engines. We systematically explore the design space for split-based optimizations, including threshold selection, split strategies, and join ordering after splits. Implemented as a front-end to DuckDB and Umbra, SplitJoin achieves substantial improvements: on DuckDB, SplitJoin completes 43 social network queries (vs. 29 natively), achieving 2.1x faster runtime and 7.9x smaller intermediates on average (up to 13.6x and 74x, respectively); on Umbra, it completes 45 queries (vs. 35), achieving 1.3x speedups and 1.2x smaller intermediates on average (up to 6.1x and 2.1x, respectively).</description>

      <title>Odyssey: An End-to-End System for Pareto-Optimal Serverless Query Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Running data analytics queries on serverless (FaaS) workers has been shown to be cost- and performance-efficient for a variety of real-world scenarios, including intermittent query arrival patterns, sudden load spikes and management challenges that afflict managed VM clusters. Alas, existing serverless data analytics works focus primarily on the serverless execution engine and assume the existence of a "good" query execution plan or rely on user guidance to construct such a plan. Meanwhile, even simple analytics queries on serverless have a huge space of possible plans, with vast differences in both performance and cost among plans.
  This paper introduces Odyssey, an end-to-end serverless-native data analytics pipeline that integrates a query planner, cost model and execution engine. Odyssey automatically generates and evaluates serverless query plans, utilizing state space pruning heuristics and a novel search algorithm to identify Pareto-optimal plans that balance cost and performance with low latency even for complex queries. Our evaluations demonstrate that Odyssey accurately predicts both monetary cost and latency, and consistently outperforms AWS Athena on cost and/or latency.</description>

      <title>Range (R\'enyi) Entropy Queries and Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15959v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data partitioning that maximizes/minimizes the Shannon entropy, or more generally the R\'enyi entropy is a crucial subroutine in data compression, columnar storage, and cardinality estimation algorithms. These partition algorithms can be accelerated if we have a data structure to compute the entropy in different subsets of data when the algorithm needs to decide what block to construct. Such a data structure will also be useful for data analysts exploring different subsets of data to identify areas of interest. While it is generally known how to compute the Shannon or the R\'enyi entropy of a discrete distribution in the offline or streaming setting efficiently, we focus on the query setting where we aim to efficiently derive the entropy among a subset of data that satisfy some linear predicates. We solve this problem in a typical setting when we deal with real data, where data items are geometric points and each requested area is a query (hyper)rectangle. More specifically, we consider a set $P$ of $n$ weighted and colored points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d$ is a constant. For the range S-entropy (resp. R-entropy) query problem, the goal is to construct a low space data structure, such that given a query (hyper)rectangle $R$, it computes the Shannon (resp. R\'enyi) entropy based on the colors and the weights of the points in $P\cap R$, in sublinear time. We show conditional lower bounds proving that we cannot hope for data structures with near-linear space and near-constant query time for both the range S-entropy and R-entropy query problems. Then, we propose exact data structures for $d=1$ and $d&gt;1$ with $o(n^{2d})$ space and $o(n)$ query time for both problems. Finally, we propose near linear space data structures for returning either an additive or a multiplicative approximation of the Shannon (resp. R\'enyi) entropy in $P\cap R$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Kernel Function for Fast Angle Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the angle testing problem in the context of similarity search in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces and propose two projection-based probabilistic kernel functions, one designed for angle comparison and the other for angle thresholding. Unlike existing approaches that rely on random projection vectors drawn from Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages reference angles and employs a deterministic structure for the projection vectors. Notably, our kernel functions do not require asymptotic assumptions, such as the number of projection vectors tending to infinity, and can be both theoretically and experimentally shown to outperform Gaussian-distribution-based kernel functions. We apply the proposed kernel function to Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 2.5X ~ 3X higher query-per-second (QPS) throughput compared to the widely-used graph-based search algorithm HNSW.</description>

      <title>GradeSQL: Test-Time Inference with Outcome Reward Models for Text-to-SQL Generation from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users. Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries. To address this limitation, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can produce correct answers after multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated one through Majority Voting. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising reinforcement learning approach for improving model alignment. We argue that ORMs could serve as an effective new test-time heuristic, although their application in this context remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we propose a unified framework for training ORMs tailored to the Text-to-SQL task and assess their effectiveness as a test-time heuristic within the BoN strategy. We benchmark ORMs against ex-BoN and Maj across the BIRD and Spider datasets, fine-tuning diverse open-source LLMs from the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 families. Results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.</description>
