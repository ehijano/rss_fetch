      <title>Probing Weak-Force Corrections to Black Hole Geometry via Long Range Potentials: Feinberg-Sucher and Ferrer-Nowakowski Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole metric arising from exotic long-range forces within quantum field theory frameworks. Specifically, we analyze two models: the Feinberg-Sucher potential for massless neutrinos and Ferrer-Nowakowski potentials for boson-mediated interactions at finite temperatures, yielding metric corrections with $r^{-5}$ and $r^{-3}$ dependencies. Using analytic expansions around the Schwarzschild photon sphere, we find that attractive potential corrections enhance gravitational lensing, enlarging the photon sphere and shadow radius, while repulsive potential corrections induce gravitational screening, reducing these observables. Our results clearly illustrate how different quantum-derived corrections can produce measurable deviations from standard Schwarzschild predictions, providing robust theoretical benchmarks for future astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the wave equation for a massive scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a massive scalar field in a fixed Schwarzschild background, the radial wave equation obeyed by Fourier modes is first studied. In addition to exact solutions at the regular singular points, we find an exact local solution in the neighbourhood of the irregular singular point at infinity. Moreover, we obtain and study the associated integral representation of the massive scalar field. Eventually, the technique developed for the irregular singular point is applied to the homogeneous equation associated to the inhomogeneous Zerilli equation for gravitational perturbations in a Schwarzschild background.</description>

      <title>Are Pad\'e approximants suitable for modelling shape functions of traversable wormholes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the applicability of Pad\'e approximants in constructing suitable shape functions for traversable wormholes, emphasizing their ability to satisfy essential geometric constraints. By analyzing low-order Pad\'e approximants, we demonstrate their effectiveness in transforming inadequate shape functions into physically consistent candidates, while inherently fulfilling critical criteria such as asymptotic flatness, flare-out conditions, and throat regularity. Specific parameter restrictions are established to ensure compliance with these constraints; for instance, low-order rational approximations help to avoid artificial singularities and maintain asymptotic behavior when derivative conditions at the throat are controlled. In contrast, high-order Pad\'e approximants introduce challenges, including spurious poles within the physical domain, which disrupt geometric requirements. Our findings highlight that low-order Pad\'e approximants provide a robust framework for simplifying complex shape functions into analytically tractable forms, balancing mathematical flexibility with physical feasibility. This work underscores their potential as a systematic tool in traversable wormhole modeling, while cautioning against unphysical artifacts in higher-order approximations.</description>

      <title>Spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope around a naked singularity and quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various studies show that the gravitational collapse of inhomogeneous matter clouds leads to naked singularity formation. We investigate here the spin precession frequency of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer in a rotating naked singularity spacetime. In the weak field limit, Lense-Thirring precession for rotating naked singularity and geodetic precession in the asymptotic limit for null naked singularity are found to be equal to that of a Kerr black hole and a Schwarzschild black hole, respectively. In addition, we can distinguish a rotating naked singularity and a Kerr naked singularity for an observer in the equatorial plane using spin precession. To this end, we have found the constraints on the parameters of rotating naked singularity by employing the Monte Carlo Markov Chain simulation and using the observation from five quasi-periodic sources within the relativistic precession model. Our analysis shows that the measurement of spin parameter estimate for GRO J1655-40 is in disagreement with the value found from the continuum-fitting method, while for XTEJ1859+226 and GRS 1915+105, it is inconsistent with spectral analysis results.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Thermodynamics in Cotton Gravity: Stability, Phase Structure and Geometrothermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of Schwarzschild-AdS and charged-AdS black holes within the framework of Cotton gravity, which is a modified theory of gravity that retains all solutions of General Relativity while addressing some of its theoretical shortcomings and enriching gravitational phenomenology at large distances. We derive key thermodynamic quantities, including mass, temperature, heat capacity and Gibbs free energy, to examine the stability and phase structure of these black hole solutions. Furthermore, employing the formalism of geometrothermodynamics, we analyze the behavior of the thermodynamic curvature scalar to identify critical points and characterize phase transitions. Our results demonstrate that the Cotton parameter \( \lambda \), which quantifies deviations from Einstein's theory, plays a pivotal role in shaping the thermodynamic behavior, resulting in new stability conditions and distinct phase transition patterns compared to those predicted by standard General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Observer-Specific Universes: A Bayesian Framework for Resolving Cosmological Naturalness Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Naturalness problems such as the hierarchy problem and the origin of dark energy remain significant challenges in modern cosmology. This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework where each observer defines their own universe, and the observer's existence conditions the probabilistic definition of that universe. We model observers as quantum detectors and formulate the problem in Bayesian terms, deriving an observer-specific likelihood using the Schwinger-Keldysh influence-functional formalism in a flat FLRW background. We prove that the imaginary part of the influence functional is positive-definite, ensuring decoherence and likelihood normalization. Careful analysis of the posterior distribution reveals that additional mechanisms are needed to fully suppress large vacuum energy values. We establish the mathematical consistency of our observer-specific framework and demonstrate its potential to provide new insights into cosmological naturalness problems, complementing traditional approaches without requiring anthropic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Fermions in a loop quantum cosmological spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed Hamiltonian treatment of an inhomogeneous fermionic perturbation propagating on a closed FLRW spacetime quantized via LQC. Expanding the fermion in spinor harmonics on spatial 3-sphere and truncating at quadratic order, we derive a decoupled, mode-by-mode Hamiltonian, where each mode behaves as a time-dependent Fermi oscillator. This framework naturally facilitates a Schrodinger-picture evolution for fermionic perturbations on a quantum-corrected background. Under the test-field approximation, each massive mode sees its own dressed metric, akin to bosonic perturbations, but with distinctive Planck-scale modifications in both temporal and spatial components. Massless modes, by contrast, experience an equivalent class of conformal backgrounds: quantum corrections drop out of the spatial sector, while the temporal component alone is dressed by quantum gravity corrections. Extending beyond the test-field regime via a Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we incorporate fermionic backreaction self-consistently. Each mode's energy (depending on the either vacuum or pair states they occupied) sources a mode-dependent shift of the background Hamiltonian, resulting in a rainbow metric. In the deep Planck regime, vacuum occupation yields a positive fermionic perturbation term in the Hamiltonian, raising the effective minisuperspace potential and delaying the bounce to higher density in the contracting branch. Excited occupation flips the perturbation sign, lowering the barrier and advancing the bounce to lower density. At large volumes, massive fermion backreaction settles into a constant energy density -- an emergent cosmological constant -- capable of driving late-time acceleration, whereas massless modes remain dynamically inert post-bounce. These effects break the exact time-reversal symmetry of the quantum bounce and generate asymmetric pre- and post-bounce trajectories.</description>

      <title>Conformal geodesics are not variational in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

      <title>Test of Quantum Gravity in Optical Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, quantum gravity effects, which can potentially be measured in magnetometers through the Larmor frequency of atoms in an external magnetic field, are estimated. It is shown that the thermal motion of atoms can, in principle, produce measurable quantum gravity effects, given the precision of modern magnetometers. If the particle velocities are caused by some other mechanism, such as convection, it is shown that the quantum gravity effects may be observed with the magnetometer's proposed detection threshold. An actual state-of-the-art optical magnetometer experiment is being designed to search for these effects and is described in a companion paper by Maldaner et al. (2023) [1].</description>

      <title>Some remarks on Frolov-AdS black hole surrounded by a fluid of string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of new solutions that generalizes the Frolov regular black hole solution is obtained. The generalization is performed by adding the cosmological constant and surrounding the black hole with a fluid of strings. Among these solutions, some preserve the regularity of the original Frolov solution, depending on the values of the parameter $\beta$, which labels the different solutions. A discussion is presented on the features of the solutions with respect to the existence or not of singularities, by examining the Kretschmann scalar, as well as by analysing the behavior of the geodesics concerning their completeness. It is performed some investigations concerning different aspects of thermodynamics, concerning the role played by the parameter associated with the Frolov regular black hole solution, as well as the parameter that codifies the presence of the fluid of strings. These are realized by considering different values of the parameter $\beta$, in particular, for $\beta=- 1/2$, in which case the regularity of the Frolov black hole is preserved. All obtained results closely align with the ones obtained by taking the appropriate particularizations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes and Gray-Body Factors for Gravitational Perturbations in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum-corrected black hole model arising from gravitational collapse in the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity was recently proposed in [A. Bonanno, D. Malafarina, A. Panassiti, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 031401 (2024)]. While quasinormal modes and gray-body factors have been analyzed for test fields in this background, no such analysis has yet been performed for gravitational perturbations. In this work, we study axial gravitational perturbations of these black holes by modeling the effective quantum corrections through an anisotropic fluid energy-momentum tensor. We compute both quasinormal modes and gray-body factors, and show that quantum corrections enhance the quality factor of the oscillations, thereby making the quantum-corrected black hole a more efficient gravitational wave emitter. At asymptotically late times, the power-law decay is indistinguishable from Price's tails, which behave as \( \sim t^{-(2\ell + 3)} \), where \( \ell \) is the multipole number. We also demonstrate that quantum corrections lead to a suppression of the gray-body factors and examine the validity of the correspondence between gray-body factors and quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>The influence of cosmological constant on light deflection in rotating spacetimes via the generalized Gibbons-Werner method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed a generalized Gibbons-Werner (GW) method for analyzing particle trajectories in rotating spacetimes, regardless of their asymptotic behavior [Huang \textit{et al.}, \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2024/01/013}{J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. 01(2024), 013}]. Using this method, we examine the impact of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) on the light deflection in rotating spacetimes within the framework of Kerr-de Sitter (KdS) geometry. Although Sultana previously calculated the deflection angle of light in KdS spacetime, our study advances this research in three aspects: (i) Orbit solution -- the light trajectory is derived by directly solving the original equation of motion (EOM) without intermediate processes. (ii) Positions of the source and observer -- the finite distances of the source and observer from the lens are explicitly considered, avoiding approximations. (iii) Staticity of the source and observer -- their comoving nature is incorporated by employing the Randers optical space. Through these refined considerations, we obtain a novel expression for the deflection angle of light in KdS spacetime, accurate to second-order in $\Lambda$, as well as in the mass (M) and spin parameter (a) of the central body. Furthermore, we engage in a detailed discussion of the discrepancies between our results and previous expressions, highlighting the reasons behind them. Finally, we evaluate the observational implications of our corrections relative to Sultana's work in the lensing systems of the Sun and Sgr A*, and show that they may become observable with forthcoming high-precision astronomical measurements.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole sourced by a generalized string fluid in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with a generalized string fluid background. Our analysis reveals that zero-tidal solutions meet all geometric criteria for traversability while avoiding singularities, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ modulating the throat geometry and asymptotic behavior. Varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\varepsilon$ significantly affects curvature both near the throat and at large distances, maintaining finite values throughout spacetime. We demonstrate that the null energy condition (NEQ) can be satisfied for high values of $\alpha$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and low string fluid density $\varepsilon$ ($\lesssim 0.1$), greatly reducing the exotic matter requirement compared to general relativistic wormholes. The string fluid's behavior approaches that of a cloud of strings for large $\alpha$ or $\varepsilon$. Additionally, the volume integral quantifier and complexity factor analyses show that increasing $\alpha$ reduces gravitational complexity and exotic matter content near the throat, aligning with NEQ preservation. Our results establish that the combined influence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and string-like matter can support traversable wormholes while minimizing unphysical energy conditions, offering new insights for constructing viable wormhole geometries in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Kerr-like Black Hole Surrounded by Cold Dark Matter Halo: The Shadow Images and EHT Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we provide shadow images of a Kerr-like black hole (BH) in cold dark matter (CDM) halo illuminated with a celestial light source and a thin accretion disk. The impact of spin parameter, critical density and the scale radius on the observed images of BHs is carefully addressed. The results indicate that as spin parameter increases, the circular orbits are shifted rightwards, while the larger values of critical density and the scale radius are the cause to enhance the radius of circular orbits of the BH shadow. In the case of the celestial light source, the impact of critical density on shadow distortion is negligible, but this influence is relatively smaller and becomes appreciable when the scale radius has larger values. Next, we discuss the intensity and the size of the inner shadow, which are gradually increasing with the increase of both parameters. On the other hand, in the case of retrograde flow, the intensity of the shadow images significantly decreases, and a crescent moon emerges on the upper right side of the screen. Subsequently, the distinctive features of red-shift factors for direct and lensed images with prograde and retrograde flows are discussed. The outcomes indicate that the distribution of red-shift factors and the optical appearance are closely related to the behavior of accreting flow as well as to relevant parameters.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative effects in Bianchi I cosmology with reduced relativistic gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we conduct a noncommutative analysis of a Bianchi I model coupled to a reduced relativistic gas. The classical field equations are modified by introducing noncommutativity through a generalized symplectic formalism. We observe that the noncommutative version of this model exhibits several significant differences compared to its commutative counterpart, as it alters the dynamics of the universe's expansion and isotropization.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Born-Infeld boson compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study gravitationally bound compact objects sourced by a string theory inspired Born-Infeld scalar field. Unlike many of their canonical scalar field counterparts, these ``boson stars'' do not have to extend out to infinity and may generate compact bodies. We analyze in detail both the junction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the center which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the object and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although involved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that these compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars and some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are several branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are realized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions tend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes, and also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface compactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made arbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some comments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable and unstable regimes. However, we argue that even in the possibly stable regime the event horizon in the vacuum region shielding the object is potentially unstable, and would cut off the star from the rest of the universe.</description>

      <title>Karmarkar-Tolman Embedded Charged Anisotropic Stars in f(R) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate various anisotropic spherical distributions of charged celestial bodies within the context of f(R) gravity, where R represents the Ricci scalar. The properties of specific charged compact objects are analyzed by using the Karmarkar-Tolman spacetime and three distinct gravitational models. The behavior of the structural parameters is examined via graphical methods. Energy constraints are applied to assess how well the results align with the Karmarkar-Tolman spacetime model. The physical acceptability of the stellar models is evaluated by checking the energy conditions and the equation of state parameter. Additionally, we explore the influence of anisotropy on the stability and internal structure of the models. Our findings are compared with predictions from general relativity to highlight the effects of f(R) gravity on charged compact stars. The obtained results are useful to enhance our understanding of how modified gravity theories affect the properties of compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Exact black hole solutions in gravity with a background Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive exact solutions for four-dimensional static spherically symmetric black holes and three-dimensional rotating black holes within a Lorentz-violating gravity theory. In this framework, Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken when a nonminimally coupled Kalb-Ramond tensor field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Building upon these solutions, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black holes using the Iyer-Wald formalism. Our findings reveal that the standard first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation remain valid for black holes in the presence of the Kalb-Ramond field.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld spacetime with a cosmic string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study gravitational lensing of the wormhole in the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) spacetime that incorporates with a cosmic string. It was found that the presence of cosmic string can enhance the light deflection in strong field limit, compared to the case of the Eills-Bronnikov wormhole. The magnification effects of this composite structure could cause some substantial impacts on the angle separation between the first and the rest of the images, and their relative brightness. Furthermore, based on these observables, we model some observable aspects in the strong and the weak field limits. The presence of a cosmic string can affect some distinguishable observables compared to the wormhole without cosmic string. This work could deepen our understanding of the spacetime structure of the wormhole in EiBI spacetime with one-dimensional topological defects.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally coupled scalar field dark sector of the universe: in-depth (Einstein frame) case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit non-minimally coupled scalar field cosmologies in the Einstein frame and present a comprehensive analysis that spans background dynamics, linear perturbations, thermodynamics, quantum gravity constraints and baryogenesis. Using a dynamical systems approach, we classify all analytical critical points for a representative set of scalar field potentials: axions (ALPs), cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential (ekpyrotic) with $\Lambda$, quintessence, and scalar field dark matter. We show that a chameleon-like coupling $f(\phi)=e^{\beta\phi}$ modifies both the expansion history and the growth of structure in a way that remains compatible with current fifth-force searches. Analytical transfer matrices for primordial tensor modes are derived, revealing a scale-dependent break in the gravitational-wave spectrum whose position and amplitude are fixed by the coupling parameter $\beta$. A causal Israel--Stewart treatment demonstrates that the same coupling supplies an effective bulk pressure that drives a smooth bounce while respecting quantum energy inequalities. Penrose's Weyl-curvature hypothesis is recovered dynamically: during an ekpyrotic phase with $\omega\gg1$ the Weyl invariant decays as $a^{-6(1+\omega)}$, resetting gravitational entropy without violating the generalized second law. A time-varying $\phi$ simultaneously generates an effective chemical potential $\mu_{B}\simeq\beta\dot{\phi}/M^{2}$, allowing for spontaneous high-scale baryogenesis whose back reaction on $\phi$ is negligible for $M\gtrsim10^{15}\sqrt{\beta}$ GeV. Swampland distance and de Sitter criteria are automatically satisfied because the ekpyrotic phase confines the field excursion to $\Delta\phi\lesssim\mathcal{O}(1)M_{\rm Pl}$. These results establish new links between dark-sector interactions, entropy production, and late-time acceleration while identifying observational windows.</description>

      <title>Multiqubit coherence of mixed states near event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study physically accessible and inaccessible N-qubit coherence of the mixed Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and W states for bosonic and fermionic fields when any $n$ ($n&lt;N$) qubits hover over the Schwarzschild black hole. We derive a comprehensive analytical expression for the coherence of mixed N-qubit systems, taking into account both accessible and inaccessible components in the curved spacetime background. Notably, as the number of qubits increases in the mixed W state, its coherence becomes more robust against the degrading effects of Hawking radiation, even as entanglement becomes more fragile. Moreover, with increasing Hawking temperature, W-state coherence surpasses that of the GHZ state, while the entanglement of the W state remains consistently weaker than that of the GHZ state. Interestingly, in Schwarzschild spacetime, fermionic fields exhibit stronger multiqubit entanglement, while bosonic fields show greater multiqubit coherence, revealing a fundamental contrast in their behavior under strong gravity. Our study reveals how Schwarzschild spacetime reshapes quantum resource trade-offs across states, statistics, and correlations, guiding relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Circular Orbits and Photon Orbits at Wormhole Throats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study timelike circular orbits and photon orbits at the throat of stationary and axisymmetric wormholes. Our minimal requirements on the spacetime are the existence of a global radial coordinate l, which connects both sides of the wormhole, two times differentiable metric components with respect to l at the wormhole throat and vanishing first derivatives of the metric components at the wormhole throat, which is the case for symmetrical wormholes. We derive expressions in terms of the metric components for the specific angular momentum $\ell$ of a test particle, that describe a possible spectrum of solutions for bound circular orbits at the wormhole throat. We identify a phase transition in the parameter space, which occurs if an ergoregion is present. Furthermore, we showcase expressions for the parameter space in terms of physical properties of the spacetime in the form of the throat circumference $C_T$ , the angular frequency of the wormhole $\omega$ and the gravitational redshift $z$. An analysis of these expressions and the characteristics of the photon orbits gives constraints on wormhole properties, as it hints to possible instabilities, such as for fast rotating wormholes and wormholes with an ergoregion. Through the use of accretion disk models, the existence of possible stable circular orbits could be linked to accretion disks surrounding the wormhole throat.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\bar{\mu}$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</description>

      <title>Identifying Proca-star mergers via consistent ultralight-boson mass estimates across gravitational-wave events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While black-hole and neutron-star mergers are the most plausible sources of current gravitational-wave observations, mergers of exotic compact objects may mimic these signals. Proca stars -- Bose-Einstein condensates of complex vector ultralight bosons -- have gained significant attention for their potential to replicate certain gravitational-wave events while yielding consistent estimates of the boson mass $\mu_{B}$ forming the stars. Using a mixture model within a Bayesian framework, we demonstrate that consistent boson-mass estimates across events can yield conclusive evidence for the existence for a number $n$ of Proca-star families characterized by respective boson masses $\mu_{B}^{i}$, even if no individual event can be conclusively identified as such. Our method provides posterior distributions for $n$ and $\mu_{B}^{i}$. Applying this framework to the high-mass events GW190521, GW190426\_190642, GW200220\_061928, we obtain a Bayes Factor ${\cal{B}}^{n=0}_{n=1} \simeq 2$ against the Proca-star hypothesis, primarily rooted in the limitation of current Proca-star merger simulations to intrinsically weak head-on cases. We discuss the use of priors that mitigate the impact of these limitations, which yields ${\cal{B}}^{n=1}_{n=0} \simeq 8$ in favour of a single Proca family hypothesis; and the inclusion of the gravitational-wave trigger S200114$\_$020818. Finally, we show that conclusive evidence $\log{\cal{B}}^{n=1}_{n=0} \geq 5$ could be achieved after 5 to 9 observations of similar event sets, at the $90\%$ credible level. This method provides a new way to detect exotic compact objects, somewhat using gravitational-wave detectors as particle detectors.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in Lorentz-violating gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of obtaining traversable wormholes supported by phantom scalar fields in Lorentz-violating gravity with an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor with a non-zero vacuum expectation value non-minimally coupled to the curvature tensor. This Lorentz violation framework shows to be a suitable scenario to search for wormhole solutions in the presence of Lorentz violation, since it introduces mild constraints on the areal radius. The vacuum expectation value of the antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, nonetheless, imposes constraints on the lapse function. As a consequence, under the vacuum configuration adopted, the allowed lapse functions can be either constant, linear or quadratic, depending on the self-interaction potential that drives the spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz symmetry. Thus, we find the Ellis-Bronnikov counterpart in this Lorentz-violating scenario as well as Lorentz-violating wormholes with a Rindler-type acceleration and an effective cosmological constant. Properties of these wormholes, such as their non-flat asymptotics, are investigated.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of pure dS$_3$ gravity in the static patch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum mechanical description of the de Sitter static patch in three-dimensional general relativity. We consider a Lorentzian path integral that conjecturally computes the Fourier transform of the spectrum of the static patch Hamiltonian. We regulate a saddle point for this integral by a complex deformation that connects it to future infinity. Our computation is thus closely connected with the wave function of de Sitter gravity on a torus at future infinity. Motivated by this, we identify an infinite number of saddle points that contribute to our Lorentzian path integral. Their sum gives a surprisingly simple result, which agrees with the expected features of the de Sitter static patch. For example, the thermal entropy, evaluated at the de Sitter temperature, agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. We also obtain a spectrum in the spin-zero sector, which is bounded, discrete, and has an integer degeneracy of states. It includes a dense spectrum of states, making both positive and negative contributions to the trace, arranged in such a way that negative contributions are invisible in the computation of any smooth observable. Nevertheless, several mysteries remain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theory of electromagnetic field, specified by an effective action functional, is considered. The causality condition is imposed in the form of a requirement that the group velocities of propagation of small and soft disturbances over the background of an external constant field should not exceed the speed of light in vacuum. It is shown that these conditions lead, in particular, to a very definite conclusion about the geometry of the local limit of the effective action. Namely, the surface, which is specified in the local limit by the nonlinear Lagrangian, considered as a function of two invariants of the field has positive Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we attempt to explore a possible connection between thermodynamic topology and the thermodynamic geometry formulation of black hole thermodynamics. We study the topological structure of black hole thermodynamic phase spaces by calculating the Euler characteristic (EC) using four well-known thermodynamic geometries: Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Geometrothermodynamics (GTD), and HPEM. We interpret the Euler characteristic as an indicator of the degree of microscopic interactions within the thermodynamic system. As the system approaches the spinoidal curve, the interaction strength increases significantly, eventually driving a phase transition. Beyond the spinoidal region, the interactions begin to weaken, and the system gradually stabilizes into a new phase configuration, reflected by a corresponding change in the topological structure of the thermodynamic state space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate quantum field theory in triangulated spacetime using compositional quantum field theory and tensor network methods. We show that gravitational interactions emerge as a low-energy effective phenomenon in this framework. For concrete calculations we use free massive scalar field theory in two-dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, but the results generalize to other models and higher dimensions. Finally, our results lead us to propose a new approach to the unification of quantum field theory with gravity, the QFT vector model, which combines insights and techniques from various current approaches to quantum gravity such as causal dynamical triangulations, random tensor models, group field theory, emergent gravity and holography.</description>

Abstract: In this second work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations with Dirichlet boundary data on a finite timelike boundary, provided the Brown-York stress tensor of the boundary is a Lorentz metric of the same sign as the induced Lorentz metric on the boundary. This is a convexity-type assumption which is an exact analog of a similar result in the Riemannian setting. This assumption on the (extrinsic) Brown-York tensor cannot be dropped in general.</description>

Abstract: To describe a general bound binary black hole system, we need to consider orbital eccentricity and the misalignment of black holes' spin vectors with respect to the orbital angular momentum. While binary black holes produced through many formation channels have negligible eccentricity close to merger, they often have a non-negligible eccentricity at formation, and dynamical interactions could produce binaries with non-negligible eccentricity in the bands of current and proposed gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Another quantity that carries information about the formation channel is the angle between each black hole's spin vector and the binary's orbital angular momentum (referred to as the spin tilt) at formation. The spin tilts inferred in GW astronomy are usually those when the binary is in the band of a GW detector, but these can differ significantly from those at formation. Therefore, it is necessary to evolve the binary back in time to compute the tilts at formation. For many formation scenarios, the tilts in the formal limit of infinite orbital angular momentum, also known as tilts at infinity, are a good approximation to those at formation. We thus generalize the publicly available \texttt{tilts\_at\_infinity} code to compute the tilts at infinity for eccentric, spin-precessing binaries. This code employs hybrid post-Newtonian evolution, starting with orbit-averaged evolution for higher frequencies and then transitioning to precession-averaged evolution to compute the tilts at infinity. We find that the transition frequency used in the quasicircular case still gives acceptably small errors in the eccentric case, and show that eccentricity and hybrid evolution both have a significant effect on the tilts at infinity for many binaries. Finally, we give examples of cases where the tilts at infinity are and are not a good approximation to the tilts at formation in the eccentric case.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons potentials of higher-dimensional Pontryagin densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the Chern-Simons potentials given the Pontryagin densities in arbitrary even dimensions $ D\geq4 $. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Pontryagin densities in $ D=4n-2 \, (n \geq 2) $ dimensions. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential of the Pontryagin density given an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of quantum superpositions in near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with quantum gravity corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum gravity corrected decoherence of quantum superpositions in the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. By employing the effective field theory approach, we model the black hole as a quantum system coupled to an external source via a scalar field, and derive the relation between the decoherence rate and the two-point correlation function of the operators acting on the black quantum system. By utilizing the low-energy Schwarzian effective theory, which captures the boundary dynamics of the $AdS_2$ near-horizon geometry of the near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, we compute the decoherence rate both in the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. We find that in the microcanonical ensemble, where the black hole energy is fixed, quantum gravity corrections do not modify the decoherence rate compared to the semiclassical prediction. However, in the canonical ensemble, where the black hole is in a thermal equilibrium state, quantum gravitational effects significantly enhance the decoherence rate at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that even in the near-extremal limit where Hawking radiation is suppressed, quantum gravitational fluctuations can strongly influence the coherence of nearby quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric extensions of nuclear equations of state: probing the breakdown scale of relativistic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological calculations of the properties of dense matter, such as relativistic mean-field theories, represent a pathway to predicting the microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars. However, such theories do not generically have well-controlled uncertainties and may break down within neutron stars. To faithfully represent the uncertainty in this breakdown scale, we develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. To achieve this, we use a nonparametric equation of state model to incorporate the correlations of the underlying relativistic mean-field theory equation of state at low pressures and transition to more flexible correlations above some chosen pressure scale. We perform astrophysical inference under various choices of the transition pressure between the theory-informed and theory-agnostic models. We further study whether the chosen relativistic mean-field theory breaks down above some particular pressure and find no such evidence. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations at about two-to-three times the precision of current constraints, we show that our method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study is made of Hawking radiation from four-dimensional black holes using effective field theory methods. The trace anomaly for the stress tensor in a general curved spacetime background is reproduced using Riegert's action. The semiclassical stress tensor is evaluated in a Schwarzschild background taking a time-independent limit for the quantum state. Imposing physical boundary conditions on an initial Cauchy surface leads to a unique state, analogous to the Unruh state with a vanishing ingoing flux and a finite outgoing flux. In particular, there is no sign of quantum hair arising from this nonlocal effective action.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we model the bounce phase, stability, and the reconstruction of the universe by non-minimal kinetic coupling. In the process, we obtained importance information about the energy density and the matter pressure of the universe in relation to the previous universe through the bounce quantum phase. The novelty of the work is that the scale factor is obtained directly from the model and is fitted with an exponential function, with this view we explore the process of the early universe even the bounce phase. After that, we plot the cosmological parameters in terms of time evolution. In what follows, we investigate the stability of the model by dynamical system analysis in a phase plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the universe, especially in the inflationary period, by using the phase-space trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a number of exact relations between optical observables, such as trigonometric parallax, position drift and the proper motion of a luminous source in addition to the variations of redshift and the viewing angle. These relations are valid in general relativity for any spacetime and they are of potential interest for astrometry and precise cosmology. They generalize the well-known Etherington's reciprocity relation between the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. Similar to Etherington's relation, they hold independently of the spacetime metric, the positions and the motions of a light source or an observer. We show that those relations follow from the symplectic property of the bi-local geodesic operator, i.e., the geometric object that describes the light propagation between two distant regions of a spacetime. The set of relations we present is complete in the sense that no other relations between those observables should hold in general. In the meantime, we develop the mathematical machinery of the bi-local approach to light propagation in general relativity and its corresponding Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the warm inflation mechanism in the presence of the Barrow holographic dark energy model. Warm inflation differs from other forms of inflation primarily in that it assumes that radiation and inflaton fields exist and interact throughout the inflationary process. After the warming process, energy moves from the inflaton to the radiation as a result of the interaction, keeping the cosmos warm. Here we have set up the warm inflationary mechanism using Barrow holographic dark energy as the driving agent. Warm inflation has been explored in a highly dissipative regime, and interesting results have been obtained. It is seen that the Barrow holographic dark energy can successfully drive a warm inflationary scenario in the early universe. Finally, the model was compared with the observational data, and compliance was found.</description>

      <title>A monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations and its solution with path-conservative finite difference CWENO schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new, monolithic first--order (both in time and space) BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The entire system of hyperbolic PDEs is solved in a completely unified manner via one single numerical scheme applied to both the conservative sector of the matter part and to the first--order strictly non--conservative sector of the spacetime evolution. The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method. In the future the new monolithic approach proposed in this paper may become an attractive alternative to traditional methods that couple central finite difference schemes with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation for the space-time part with totally different TVD schemes for the matter evolution and which are currently the state of the art in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, gravitational waveforms emitted by inspiralling compact binary systems on quasicircular orbits in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are computed in the lowest post-Newtonian approximation. By applying the stationary phase approximation, Fourier transforms of the tensor polarization modes are obtained, and correction terms in the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves relative to General Relativity results are derived. Moreover, post-Einsteinian parameters are identified, and potential constraints on the background value of the scalar field are obtained based on possible observations of the gravitational waves by the future ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, constraints on the background value of the scalar field are derived using updated observational data from the PSR J0737-3039 system. These latter constraints are comparable in order of magnitude to the best currently existing constraints, which were derived from observational data within the Solar System.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of relativistic stars made of isotropic matter within the framework of the minimal Standard Model Extension, where a Bumblebee field (BF) coupled to spacetime induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. We adopt analytic equations-of-state describing either condensate dark stars or strange quark stars. We solve the structure equations numerically, and we compute the mass-to-radius relationships. The influence of the Bumblebee parameter $\mathbf{l}$ is examined in detail, and an upper bound is obtained using the massive pulsar (PSR) J0740+6620 and the strangely light High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) J1731-347 compact object.</description>

Abstract: We study eccentric equatorial orbits of a stellar-mass black hole around an intermediate-mass slowly rotating Kerr black hole in the presence of gravitational radiation and a dark matter halo. The stellar-mass companion will inspiral towards the central black hole while emitting gravitational waves. The evolution is affected by the dynamical friction force caused by the presence of dark matter surrounding the intermediate-mass black hole at the core. Previous studies have shown that the presence of dark matter can be deduced from the gravitational waveforms. We explore the combined effects of slow-rotation of the central black hole and the presence of the dark matter halo around it on the system's gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime to model the process. The role of cosmological observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. Results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, with specific results for primordial black holes (PBHs). The timescale of evaporation is shown to depend significantly on the choice of cosmological observer, and may differ substantially from predictions based on stationary models in later times. Deviations are also shown with respect to the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study time-like geodesics around a spherically symmetric black hole in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, characterized by the parameter $l$, which induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The geodesic equations and effective potential are derived to investigate the influence of $l$. We calculate the marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, analyzing the parameter's impact. Periodic orbits are computed numerically and classified within the standard taxonomy, revealing significant effects of $l$ on their momentum and energy. Additionally, we explore an extreme mass ratio inspiral system under the adiabatic approximation to derive gravitational waveforms emitted by an object orbiting a supermassive black hole in KR gravity. These waveforms reflect the distinctive characteristics of periodic orbits and highlight the influence of $l$. With advancements in gravitational wave detection, these results offer insights into black holes influenced by Lorentz symmetry-breaking fields.</description>

      <title>From Matter Density to Deflection Angle and Gravitational Lensing Using a Perturbative Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a perturbative method to compute the deflection angle of null or timelike signals in spacetimes filled with a static and spherically symmetric (SSS) perfect fluid with fairly arbitrary density distributions. After solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, the metric functions of the spacetime are obtained either as asymptotic series or as expansions around a finite boundary. The deflection angles of null or timelike signals in the weak-field limit in such spacetimes can then be expressed as series expansions in terms of the impact parameter, with coefficients determined by the metric expansions and, in turn, the density distribution function. Gravitational lensing equations are also solved perturbatively to derive the apparent angles of the lensed images. Comparing our analytical formulas with numerical results demonstrates the validity and efficiency of our method and results. This procedure establishes a direct connection between the mass density, the deflection angle, and the apparent angles of gravitationally lensed images. We apply these methods and results to the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model and some other density profiles to analyze the influence of the density parameters.</description>

      <title>$f(T)$ Gravity: Background Dependence and Propagating Degrees of Freedom</title>

Abstract: The standard cosmological model, rooted in General Relativity (GR), has achieved remarkable success, yet it still faces unresolved issues like the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the Hubble tension. These challenges might imply the need for alternative gravitational theories. Teleparallel gravity offers a compelling framework by reformulating the gravitational interaction using torsion, rather than curvature, as its fundamental geometrical property. This paper delves into $f(T)$ gravity, an extension of the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which introduces non-linear modifications of the torsion scalar $T$. We focus on the role of spacetime-dependent Lorentz transformations in the vierbein formalism, examining their impact on both background solutions and perturbation dynamics. Special attention is given to the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW spacetime, as well as the anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime. Furthermore, the analysis of the propagating degrees of freedom on these spacetimes is performed. While it is well established that TEGR reproduces the same results as GR, the propagating degrees of freedom in its non-linear extension, $f(T)$ gravity, is still debated in the literature. In this work, we find that only two fields propagate in the gravity sector, independently of the background spacetime considered, either FLRW or Bianchi I. Although not definitive, this paper provides fresh insights into the issue of the propagating degrees of freedom in $f(T)$ gravity, opening the door to intriguing new directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian-Euclidean black holes and Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent papers on spacetimes with a signature-changing metric, the concept of a Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole and new elements for Lorentzian-Riemannian signature change have been introduced. A Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole is a signature-changing modification of the Schwarzschild spacetime satisfying the vacuum Einstein equations in a weak sense. Here the event horizon serves as a boundary beyond which time becomes imaginary. We demonstrate that the proper time needed to reach the horizon remains finite, consistently with the classical Schwarzschild solution. About Lorentzian to Riemannian metric transitions, we stress that the hypersurface where the metric signature changes is naturally a spacelike hypersurface which can be identified with the future or past causal boundary of the Lorentzian sector. Moreover, a number of geometric interpretations appear, as the degeneracy of the metric corresponds to the collapse of the causal cones into a line, the degeneracy of the dual metric corresponds to collapsing into a hyperplane, and additional geometric structures on the transition hypersurface (Galilean and dual Galilean) might be explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently suggested the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes is related to a class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theories described by Seiberg-Witten curves, a proposal that has been tested for a number of black hole spacetimes. The aim of this study is to clarify the key ideas of this conjecture to a non-high-energy-physics audience and test it in a setting that has not yet been explored: the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of Kerr-Newman black holes in the Dudley-Finley approximation. In the parameter space we explore, we find numerical evidence that the conjecture is valid for subextremal black holes and its slowest damped quasinormal frequencies, thereby providing further support for the conjecture's validity. In addition, we exploit the symmetries of the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills theory to obtain a strikingly simple isospectral version of the radial Dudley-Finley equation.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal approach for linear and non-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this numerical work, we deal with two distinct problems concerning the propagation of waves in cosmological backgrounds. In both cases, we employ a spacetime foliation given in terms of compactified hyperboloidal slices. These slices intersect future null infinity, so our method is well-suited to study the long-time behaviour of waves. Moreover, our construction is adapted to the presence of the time--dependent scale factor that describes the underlying spacetime expansion. First, we investigate decay rates for solutions to the linear wave equation in a large class of expanding FLRW spacetimes, whose non--compact spatial sections have either zero or negative curvature. By means of a hyperboloidal foliation, we provide new numerical evidence for the sharpness of decay--in--time estimates for linear waves propagating in such spacetimes. Then, in the spatially-flat case, we present numerical results in support of small data global existence of solutions to semi-linear wave equations in FLRW spacetimes having a decelerated expansion, provided that a generalized null condition holds. In absence of this null condition and in the specific case of $ \square_g \phi = (\partial_t \phi)^2 $ (Fritz John's choice), the results we obtain suggest that, when the spacetime expansion is sufficiently slow, solutions diverge in finite time for every choice of initial data.</description>

      <title>Black holes surrounded by massive vector fields in Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact black hole solution surrounded by massive vector fields predicted by Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity. KK gravity in four dimensions (4D) is of particular interest, as it predicts a tower of particle states, including gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 components, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity. The extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational sector modify the law of gravity, allowing the theory to explain the effects attributed to dark matter in the universe. In this paper, we construct a black hole solution surrounded by massive spin-1 gravitons within KK theory. In addition to the influence of the massive vector fields, we incorporate an interaction term between the black hole and the massive vector field. The black hole solution is affected by the mass of the spin-1 graviton and an additional parameter that encodes corrections to Newton's constant, as well as the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mass. We find that the coupling between the massive vector field and the black hole mimics the effect of an electric charge. To this end, we investigate the accretion disk, quasinormal modes (QNMs), and the stability of the black hole spacetime. Finally, we use Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* to constrain the black hole parameters.</description>

      <title>Shadows and optical appearance of quantum-corrected black holes illuminated by static thin accretions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, two new quantum-corrected black hole models satisfying covariance have been proposed within the framework of effective quantum gravity. In this paper, we study how the quantum parameter $\zeta$ affects the optical properties of two quantum-corrected black hole models. We first analyze the photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and innermost stable circular orbit as $\zeta$ varies, and constrain $\zeta$ using Event Horizon Telescope data. Additionally, by employing the ray-tracing method to study photon trajectories near the two quantum-corrected black holes, we find that $\zeta$ can reduce the range of impact parameters corresponding to the photon ring and lensed ring. We then examine the optical appearance of these black holes with thin accretion disks, showing $\zeta$ significantly brightens the first model's image but has little effect on the second. Meanwhile, we demonstrate the contributions of the transfer functions to the observed intensity of direct and lensed ring in the observer's field of view, which has rarely been separately illustrated in previous studies. Finally, we study the optical appearance of both quantum-corrected black holes under a static spherical accretion model, with results consistent with the above. Therefore, we conclude that the second quantum-corrected black hole is almost indistinguishable from the Schwarzschild black hole, while the first quantum-corrected black hole can be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole through its optical appearance.</description>

      <title>The Beltrami -- de Sitter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the well-known Beltrami-Klein model of non-Euclidean geometry on a $2-$dimensional disk, where the geodesics are the chords of the disk, with the $2-$dimensional de Sitter space. The geometry of the de Sitter space is defined on the complement of the Beltrami-Klein disk in the plane, with the de Sitter metric being the unique Lorentzian Einstein metric whose light cones form cones tangent to the disk in this complement. This leads to a Beltrami-de Sitter model on the plane ${\bf R}^2$, which is endowed with the Riemannian Beltrami metric on the disk and the Lorentzian de Sitter metric outside the disk in ${\bf R}^2$.
  We explore the relevance of this model for Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, first in the $2-$dimensional setting and subsequently in higher dimensions, including the physically significant case of four dimensions. In this context, we define a Radon-like transform between the de Sitter and Beltrami spaces, facilitating the purely geometric transformation of physical fields from the Lorentzian de Sitter space to the Riemannian Beltrami space.
  In the $2-$, and $3-$dimensional cases, we also uncover a hidden ${\bf G}_2$ symmetry associated with the de Sitter spaces in these dimensions, which is related to a certain vector distribution naturally defined by the geometry of the model. We suggest the potential for discovering similar hidden symmetries in the $n-$dimensional Beltrami-de Sitter model.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon particles in a nonuniform external magnetic field in Bonnor-Melvin rainbow gravity background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of rainbow gravity on Klein-Gordon (KG) bosons in a quantized nonuniform magnetic field in the background of Bonnor-Melvin (BM) spacetime with a cosmological constant. In the process, we show that the BM spacetime introduces domain walls (i.e., infinitely impenetrable hard walls) at \(r = 0\) and \(r = \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}\), as a consequence of the effective gravitational potential field generated by such a magnetized BM spacetime. As a result, the motion of KG particles/antiparticles is restricted indefinitely within the range \(r \in [0, \pi/\sqrt{2\Lambda}]\), and the particles and antiparticles cannot be found elsewhere. Next, we provide a conditionally exact solution in the form of the general Heun function \(H_G(a, q, \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, z)\). Within the BM domain walls and under the condition of exact solvability, we study the effects of rainbow gravity on KG bosonic fields in a quantized nonuniform external magnetic field in the BM spacetime background. We use three pairs of rainbow functions: \( f(u) = (1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|)^{-1}, \, h(u) = 1 \); and \( f(u) = 1, \, h(u) = \sqrt{1 - \tilde{\beta} |E|^\upsilon} \), with \(\upsilon = 1,2\), where \(u = |E| / E_p\), \(\tilde{\beta} = \beta / E_p\), and \(\beta\) is the rainbow parameter. We find that such pairs of rainbow functions, \((f(u), h(u))\), fully comply with the theory of rainbow gravity, ensuring that \(E_p\) is the maximum possible energy for particles and antiparticles alike. Moreover, we show that the corresponding bosonic states form magnetized, rotating vortices, as intriguing consequences of such a magnetized BM spacetime background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a $d$-dimensional constraint formula for the black hole shadow radius, providing a standardized framework for using observational confidence intervals to constrain the corresponding characteristic parameters in $d$-dimensional black hole solutions. This approach can correct the misapplication of shadow radius constraints in some previous studies. Subsequently, we selected two regular Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black hole solutions as a representative example to test the $d$-dimensional shadow constraint formula. Our analysis reveals that the characteristic parameters within these $d$-dimensional black hole solutions maintain physically meaningful bounded domains under shadow radius constraints. We further propose that this $d$-dimensional shadow constraint formula is universal and can be applied to constrain the characteristic parameters in other high-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole solutions.</description>

Abstract: Collective excitations (phonons) in barotropic, irrotational, inviscid fluids exhibit an effective Lorentz invariance, where the sound speed plays the role of the invariant speed of light in special relativity. By carefully selecting the interaction potentials, we explicitly construct two hydrodynamic models in which phonons obey doubly special relativistic kinematics, with the analogue Planck scale emerging from non-Newtonian behaviour at high energies. Specifically, we demonstrate that elastic storage leads to an approximate realization of Amelino-Camelia's scenario, while the Magueijo-Smolin model naturally emerges in the presence of elastic restoring forces.</description>

      <title>Extended Tsallis-Cirto entropy for black and white holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reference [1] we considered the black hole thermodynamics with the non-extensive entropy. This entropy obeys the composition rule which coincides with the composition rule in the non-extensive Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. Here we extend this approach to the thermodynamics of white holes. The entropy of the white hole is negative as follows from the rate of macroscopic quantum tunneling from black hole to white hole. The white hole entropy is with the minus sign the entropy of the black hole with the same mass, $S_{\rm WH}(M)=-S_{\rm BH}(M)$. This reflects the anti-symmetry with respect to time reversal, at which the shift vector in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This symmetry allows one to extend the Tsallis-Chirto entropy by adding a minus sign to the Tsallis-Chirto formula applied to white hole. As a result, the composition rule remains the same, with the only difference being that instead of entropy it contains the entropy modulus. The same non-extensive composition rule is obtained for the entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. This entropy is formed by the positive entropy of the outer horizon and the negative entropy of the inner horizon. The model of the black hole formed by "black hole atoms" with Planck-scale mass is also extended to include the negative entropy of white holes.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, but current constraints suggest they cannot compose all of DM. This implies that additional DM components could coexist with PBHs, one of which could form "dark dresses" (DDs) around PBHs. DDs would cause PBH binaries to experience dynamical friction (DF), which would accelerate their inspirals with respect to those in vacuum. Ignoring DF effects in matched-filtering searches could lead to significant sensitivity loss, especially in systems with asymmetric mass-ratios of q ~ 10^{-3}. We thus show that a method designed to find time-frequency power-law tracks from inspiraling PBHs in vacuum could actually handle the presence of DDs with minimal modifications. This method, the generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), maps points in the detector's time-frequency plane to lines in the source parameter space. We show that this pattern-recognition technique can recover simulated DD signals in Gaussian noise, marking an important step forward in developing DM-aware methods beyond matched filtering.</description>

      <title>Using nanokelvin quantum thermometry to detect timelike Unruh effect in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is found that the Unruh effect can not only arise out of the entanglement between two sets of modes spanning the left and right Rindler wedges, but also between modes spanning the future and past light cones. Furthermore, an inertial Unruh-DeWitt detector along a spacetime trajectory in one of these cones may exhibit the same thermal response to the vacuum as that of an accelerated detector confined in the Rindler wedge. This feature thus could be an alternative candidate to verify the ``Unruh effect", termed as the timelike Unruh effect correspondingly. In this paper we propose to detect the timelike Unruh effect by using an impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The impurity acts as the detector which interacts with the density fluctuations in the condensate, working as an effective quantum field. Following the paradigm of the emerging field of quantum thermometry, we combine quantum parameter estimation theory with the theory of open quantum systems to realize a nondemolition Unruh temperature measurement in the nanokelvin (nK) regime. Our results demonstrate that the timelike Unruh effect can be probed using a stationary two-level impurity with time-dependent energy gap immersed in a BEC within current technologies.</description>

      <title>Invariant tensions from holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14998v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of defining an invariant notion of tension in gravity. For spacetimes whose asymptotics are those of a Defect CFT we propose two independent definitions : Gravitational tension given by the one-point function of the dilatation current, and inertial tension, or stiffness, given by the norm of the displacement operator. We show that both reduce to the tension of the Nambu-Goto action in the limit of classical thin probe branes. Subtle normalisations of the relevant Witten diagrams are fixed by the Weyl and diffeomorphism Ward identities of the boundary DCFT. The gravitational tension is not defined for domain walls, whereas stiffness is not defined for point particles. When they both exist these two tensions are in general different, but the examples of line and surface BPS defects in $d=4$ show that superconformal invariance can identify them.</description>

      <title>Hints of Nonminimally Coupled Gravity in DESI 2024 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) are two of the most robust observations in cosmology. The recent BAO measurements from the DESI collaboration have presented, for the first time, inconsistency between BAO and CMB within the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM, indicating a preference for dynamical dark energy over a cosmological constant. We analyze the theoretical implication of the DESI BAO observation for dark energy and gravity employing a nonparametric reconstruction approach for both the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}(a)$ and the effective field theory coefficients. We find that the DESI data can rule out quintessence dark energy by indicating a crossing of the phantom divide at $z\lesssim1$. Furthermore, when analyzed within the broad context of Horndeski gravity which includes general relativity and many known modified gravity theories such as generalized Galileons, $f(R)$ and Brans-Dicke, our result implies that gravity should be nonminimally coupled to explain the observations, establishing the DESI result as the first hint of modified gravity. Based on these insights, we propose the \textit{thawing gravity} model to explain the nonminimal coupling and phantom crossing indicated by observation, which also fits better to DESI BAO, CMB and type Ia Supernovae data than $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond field, black holes and black strings in (2 + 1)D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is either at or enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The new black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also find that the masses of a class of the black holes can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the (independent component of the) Kalb-Ramond field in the dual black strings. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons. Black hole solutions with a ring curvature singularity in between their inner and outer horizons are also presented.</description>

      <title>The primordial non-Gaussianities for non-singular Horndeski cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have acquired and analyzed the bispectrum of primordial scalar perturbations and the corresponding non-Gaussianities in the particular model of the contracting Universe with strong gravity in the past within the framework of the Horndeski theory. The found shape function of the bispectrum did not correspond to the widely used local, equilateral, orthogonal or enfolded shapes. We also evaluate non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\text{NL}}$ for different wave numbers $\vec{k}_1$, $\vec{k}_2$, $\vec{k}_3$ configurations. The convenient ones in our case are: (i) $k_1=k_2$, $k_3\to 0$ (local configuration of wave numbers); (ii) $k_1=k_2=k_3$ (equilateral configuration); (iii) the enfolded one, where $k_1=k_2+k_3$, which is a linear combination of the equilateral and orthogonal configurations. For each separate configuration (local, equilateral, and enfolded) it is possible to satisfy the current observational bounds for non-linear parameter even under the restrictions of the applicability of regime, where the background evolution and perturbations are legitimately described within classical field theory and weakly coupled quantum theory at all times. However, one can not select the parameters of the model so that all three non-linear parameters $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{local}}$, $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{equil}}$, and $f_{\text{NL}}^{\text{enfold}}$ would simultaneously satisfy the acceptable observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian metric spaces and GH-convergence: the unbounded case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Lorentzian metric space which drops the boundedness condition from our previous work and argue that the properties defining our spaces are minimal. In fact, they are defined by three conditions given by (a) the reverse triangle inequality for chronologically related events, (b) Lorentzian distance continuity and relative compactness of chronological diamonds, and (c) a distinguishing condition via the Lorentzian distance function. By adding a countably generating condition we confirm the validity of desirable properties for our spaces including the Polish property. The definition of (pre)length space given in our previous work on the bounded case is generalized to this setting. We also define a notion of Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for Lorentzian metric spaces and prove that (pre)length spaces are GH-stable. It is also shown that our (sequenced) Lorentzian metric spaces bring a natural quasi-uniformity (resp. quasi-metric). Finally, an explicit comparison with other recent constructions based on our previous work on bounded Lorentzian metric spaces is presented.</description>

      <title>Harvesting primordial black holes from stochastic trees with $\texttt{FOREST}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework to implement stochastic inflation on stochastic trees, modelling the inflationary expansion as a branching process. Combined with the $\delta N$ formalism, this allows us to generate real-space maps of the curvature perturbation that fully capture quantum diffusion and its non-perturbative backreaction during inflation. Unlike lattice methods, trees do not proceed on a fixed background since new spacetime units emerge dynamically as trees unfold, naturally incorporating metric fluctuations. The recursive structure of stochastic trees also offers remarkable numerical efficiency, and we develop the FOrtran Recursive Exploration of Stochastic Trees ($\texttt{FOREST}$) tool and demonstrate its performance. We show how primordial black holes blossom at unbalanced nodes of the trees, and how their mass distribution can be obtained while automatically accounting for the "cloud-in-cloud" effect. In the "quantum-well" toy model, we find broad mass distributions, with mild power laws terminated by exponential tails. We finally compare our results with existing approximations in the literature and discuss several prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized charge current for a massless, minimally coupled, charged quantum scalar field on a charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole space-time, using the method of pragmatic mode-sum renormalization. Since the field exhibits superradiance, we consider the past Unruh, Boulware and Candelas-Chrzanowski-Howard states, and study how the renormalized current in these states depends on the charges of the black hole and scalar field. We also study the backreaction of the charge current on the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, we show that high-SNR BBHs can be confidently localized to specific Milky Way GCs with a sky localization accuracy of $\delta \Omega \sim 1$~deg$^2$, and address the large uncertainties in their distance measurement ($\delta R \sim 0.3 - 20$~kpc). The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

These include the computation of holographic timelike entanglement entropy and estimation of various other field theory observables for example, the flow central charge and the quantum complexity.

      <title>$T\overline{T}$ Deformation: Introduction and Some Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review explores recent advances in the theory of $T\bar{T}$ deformation, an irrelevant yet solvable deformation of quantum field theories defined via the quadratic form of the energy-momentum tensor. It addresses classical and quantum aspects, highlighting significant developments across various fields, including field theory, holography, and string theory. Classically, $T\bar{T}$ deformation manifests through multiple geometric interpretations, notably random geometry, Jackiw-Teitelboim-like gravity, and uniform light-cone gauge frameworks. For quantum aspects, the deformation introduces notable features such as non-locality, UV-IR mixing, solvable renormalization structures, and intriguing modifications to correlation functions and entanglement properties. Furthermore, the paper examines the profound relationship between $T\bar{T}$ deformation and holography, particularly within the mixed boundary conditions/cutoff AdS holography proposal and holographic entanglement entropy. Connections to string theory through single-trace deformations and their holographic duals further reveal the deformed structure of the worldsheet. This review synthesizes recent developments and outlines potential directions for future research in the study of $T\bar{T}$-like deformation.</description>

      <title>On the Explicit Asymptotic Symmetry Breaking of sl(3,R) Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic symmetry algebras (ASA) of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the framework of sl(3,R) symmetry. By explicitly constructing this algebra,
  we explore how the presence of the dilaton field influences the structure of asymptotic symmetries and symmetry breaking mechanisms at the AdS(2) boundary. For the sl(3,R) model, the
  dilaton field preserves a subset of the complete W(3)-symmetry, restricting the algebra to sl(3,R). These results provide deeper insights into the role of dilaton dynamics
  in holographic dualities, with implications for the thermodynamics and geometry of AdS(2). The findings pave the way for systematically exploring extended gauge symmetries in
  two-dimensional gravity and their relevance to higher-rank Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Elementary atoms in spaces of constant curvature by the Nikiforov-Uvarov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nikiforov-Uvarov method is a simple, yet elegant and powerful method for solving second-order differential equations of generalized hypergeometric type. In the past, it has been used to solve many problems in quantum mechanics and elsewhere. We apply this method to the classical problem of hydrogen-like atoms in spaces of constant curvature. Both the spectra of these atoms and their wave functions, including normalization, are easily obtained.</description>

      <title>Improved null tests of $\Lambda$CDM and FLRW in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DESI DR2 BAO data exclude the flat $\Lambda$CDM model at more than 2.5$\sigma$, depending on different data combinations when analyzed through the $w_0w_a$CDM parametrization. This simple parametrization may introduce bias in the results. We use null tests that probe for deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM at late times, independent of any specific dark energy parametrization. We provide several diagnostics for null tests and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, we derive diagnostics that improve on previous ones, such as the popular $O_{\rm m}$ diagnostic. The diagnostics are derived from both background and perturbed quantities. Using the combination of DESI DR2 BAO and supernova data, with or without CMB data, we find that deviations from flat $\Lambda$CDM are at $\sim1\sigma$ confidence level in most of the redshift range (more than 1$\sigma$ for a few small redshift intervals in a few cases). These deviations are minor for other non-DESI SDSS-IV BAO data combined with Pantheon+, with or without CMB data. Since spatial curvature can potentially modify the results, we also test for curvature in the general $\Lambda$CDM model and the general FLRW model. While there is slight evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature at lower redshifts in a general $\Lambda$CDM model, there is no statistically significant evidence in a general FLRW model.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$\textbf{$c$}$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dynamical Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is one of the most fundamental questions in cosmology. Using the cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN) and DESI's new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), we find the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of the evolution of dark matter in the dynamical dark matter (DDM) model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm0}+\omega_{dma}(1-a)$. Based on CMB data, we find a very strong linear relation $\omega_{dma}=-\omega_{dm0}$, inducing the single-parameter DDM model, $\omega_{dm}(a)=\omega_{dm}a$, where the $\sim2\,\sigma$ DDM evidences is well captured and even strengthened. We demonstrate that there are beyond $2\,\sigma$ evidences of the coexistence of DDM and dynamical dark energy using the combinations of CMB, DESI BAO and Pantheon+ SN data. In such models, at a beyond $5\,\sigma$ confidence level, we verify that the universe remains in a matter-dominated state for a substantial period in the past, accelerate in the distant future and finally becomes completely dominated by dark matter. We propose that the ultimate fate of the universe is the ``Super Rip'' induced by dark matter with an extremely negative pressure. Our findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing understanding of cosmic acceleration and deepen our insight into the universe's evolution.</description>

      <title>Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.</description>

      <title>A review of applications of Quantum Energy Teleportation: from experimental tests to thermodynamics and spacetime engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum energy teleportation (QET) exploits the existence of correlations to enable remote energy transfer without the need for physical energy carriers between emitter and receiver. This paper presents a review of the thermodynamic foundations of QET and reviews its first experimental demonstration (performed using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), along with its implementation on publicly available superconducting quantum hardware. Additionally, we review an application of QET in the field of quantum thermodynamics as an efficient algorithmic cooling technique to cool down individual parts of interacting systems. Finally, we will review how QET can be employed to optimally generate exotic quantum states characterized by negative average stress-energy densities, offering a new operational approach to engineering such states which are promising in the context of semiclassical gravity.</description>
