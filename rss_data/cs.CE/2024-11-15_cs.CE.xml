      <title>Synthesis Method for Obtaining Characteristic Modes of Multi-Structure Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient method of characteristic mode decomposition for multi-structure systems. Our approach leverages the translation and rotation matrices associated with vector spherical wavefunctions, enabling the synthesis of a total system's characteristic modes through independent simulation of each constituent structure. We simplify the computationally demanding translation problem by dividing it into three manageable sub-tasks: rotation, z-axis translation, and inverse rotation, which collectively enhance computational efficiency. Furthermore, this method facilitates the exploration of structural orientation effects without incurring additional computational overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present a series of compelling numerical examples that not only validate the accuracy of the method but also highlight its significant advantages.</description>

      <title>RNA-GPT: Multimodal Generative System for RNA Sequence Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNAs are essential molecules that carry genetic information vital for life, with profound implications for drug development and biotechnology. Despite this importance, RNA research is often hindered by the vast literature available on the topic. To streamline this process, we introduce RNA-GPT, a multi-modal RNA chat model designed to simplify RNA discovery by leveraging extensive RNA literature. RNA-GPT integrates RNA sequence encoders with linear projection layers and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) for precise representation alignment, enabling it to process user-uploaded RNA sequences and deliver concise, accurate responses. Built on a scalable training pipeline, RNA-GPT utilizes RNA-QA, an automated system that gathers RNA annotations from RNACentral using a divide-and-conquer approach with GPT-4o and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to efficiently handle large datasets and generate instruction-tuning samples. Our experiments indicate that RNA-GPT effectively addresses complex RNA queries, thereby facilitating RNA research. Additionally, we present RNA-QA, a dataset of 407,616 RNA samples for modality alignment and instruction tuning, further advancing the potential of RNA research tools.</description>

      <title>Improving hp-Variational Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Steady-State Convection-Dominated Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies two extensions of applying hp-variational physics-informed neural networks, more precisely the FastVPINNs framework, to convection-dominated convection-diffusion-reaction problems. First, a term in the spirit of a SUPG stabilization is included in the loss functional and a network architecture is proposed that predicts spatially varying stabilization parameters. Having observed that the selection of the indicator function in hard-constrained Dirichlet boundary conditions has a big impact on the accuracy of the computed solutions, the second novelty is the proposal of a network architecture that learns good parameters for a class of indicator functions. Numerical studies show that both proposals lead to noticeably more accurate results than approaches that can be found in the literature.</description>

      <title>Component based model order reduction with mortar tied contact for nonlinear quasi-static mechanical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a model order reduction technique for nonlinear structures assembled from components.The reduced order model is constructed by reducing the substructures with proper orthogonal decomposition and connecting them by a mortar-tied contact formulation. The snapshots for the substructure projection matrices are computed on the substructure level by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. The snapshots are computed using a random sampling procedure based on a parametrization of boundary conditions. To reduce the computational effort of the snapshot computation full-order simulations of the substructures are only computed when the error of the reduced solution is above a threshold. In numerical examples, we show the accuracy and efficiency of the method for nonlinear problems involving material and geometric nonlinearity as well as non-matching meshes. We are able to predict solutions of systems that we did not compute in our snapshots.</description>

      <title>Circularity of Thermodynamical Material Networks: Indicators, Examples, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition towards a circular economy has gained importance over the last years since the traditional linear take-make-dispose paradigm is not sustainable in the long term. Recently, thermodynamical material networks (TMNs) [1] have been proposed as an approach to design material flows based on the idea that any supply chain can be seen as a set of thermodynamic compartments that can be added, removed, modified or connected differently. Compared to the well-established material flow analysis (MFA), TMNs leverage dynamical energy balances and ordinary differential equations along with the usual mass balances, thus tackling circular economy as a material network design problem analogous to traditional engineering design approaches (e.g., design of thermodynamic cycles, electrical and hydraulic networks) rather than as an analysis of stock-and-flow data. Hence, TMNs allow the depiction of highly dynamic material stocks and flows whose variations can occur in less than 1 minute; achieving such modelling accuracy with MFA would be more data intensive. In this paper, we first develop several circularity indicators of TMNs using a graph-based formalism. Then, we illustrate their calculation using two numerical examples for the case of fluid materials and one numerical example for the case of solid materials, for which the detailed hybrid dynamical equations and simulation outputs are provided. The paper source code is publicly available.</description>
