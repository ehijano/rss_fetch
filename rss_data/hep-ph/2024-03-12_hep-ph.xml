      <title>Particle shells from relativistic bubble walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <title>OmniJet-$\alpha$: The first cross-task foundation model for particle physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models are multi-dataset and multi-task machine learning methods that once pre-trained can be fine-tuned for a large variety of downstream applications. The successful development of such general-purpose models for physics data would be a major breakthrough as they could improve the achievable physics performance while at the same time drastically reduce the required amount of training time and data.
  We report significant progress on this challenge on several fronts. First, a comprehensive set of evaluation methods is introduced to judge the quality of an encoding from physics data into a representation suitable for the autoregressive generation of particle jets with transformer architectures (the common backbone of foundation models). These measures motivate the choice of a higher-fidelity tokenization compared to previous works. Finally, we demonstrate transfer learning between an unsupervised problem (jet generation) and a classic supervised task (jet tagging) with our new OmniJet-$\alpha$ model. This is the first successful transfer between two different and actively studied classes of tasks and constitutes a major step in the building of foundation models for particle physics.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of astrophobic axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot axions are produced in the early Universe via their interactions with Standard Model particles, contributing to dark radiation commonly parameterized as $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$. In standard QCD axion benchmark models, this contribution to $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ is negligible after taking into account astrophysical limits such as the SN1987A bound. We therefore compute the axion contribution to $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ in so-called astrophobic axion models characterized by strongly suppressed axion couplings to nucleons and electrons, in which astrophysical constraints are relaxed and $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ may be sizable. We also construct new astrophobic models in which axion couplings to photons and/or muons are suppressed as well, allowing for axion masses as large as few eV. Most astrophobic models are within the reach of CMB-S4, while some allow for $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ as large as the current upper bound from Planck and thus will be probed by the Simons Observatory. The majority of astrophobic axion models predicting large $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$ is also within the reach of IAXO or even BabyIAXO.</description>

      <title>A Gravitational M\'enage \`a Trois: leptogenesis, primordial gravitational wave &amp; PBH-induced reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of %dynamically producing the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe uniquely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) that are formed in an inflaton-dominated background. Considering the inflaton $(\phi)$ to oscillate in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^n$, we show, it is possible to obtain the desired baryon asymmetry via vanilla leptogenesis from evaporating PBHs of initial mass $\lesssim 10$ g. We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $\beta$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state. We finally illustrate that such gravitational leptogenesis scenarios can be tested with upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors, courtesy of the blue-tilted primordial GW with inflationary origin, thus paving a way to probe a PBH-induced reheating together with leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Models of radiative linear seesaw with electrically charged mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two versions of radiative linear seesaw models, where electrically charged scalars and vector-like leptons generate the Dirac neutrino mass submatrix at one and two loop levels. In these models, the SM charged lepton masses are generated from a one loop level radiative seesaw mechanism mediated by charged exotic vector-like leptons and electrically neutral scalars running in the loops. These models can successfully accommodate the current amount of dark matter and baryon asymmetries observed in the Universe, as well as the muon anomalous magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Testing effective field theory with the most general neutron decay correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Built on the seminal works by Jackson-Treiman-Wyld and Ebel-Feldman, we derive the most general free neutron differential decay rate where all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) are polarized. This introduces 33 new correlations in addition to the 18 existing ones, which over-constrain the coupling constants in the low-energy effective field theory of charged weak interactions, and thus provides stringent tests of the validity of the theory framework itself. We classify the correlation coefficients in terms of their Standard Model limit and discrete symmetries, and study their expansion with respect to the new physics coupling strengths, supplemented by the experiment-independent $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ virtual electromagnetic radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>Symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from transverse momentum conservation and flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-particle cumulants method can be used to reveal long-range collectivity in small and large colliding systems. The four-particle symmetric cumulant $sc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$, three-particle asymmetric cumulant $ac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$, and the normalised cumulants $nsc_{2,4} \left \{ 4 \right \}$ and $nac_{2} \left \{ 3 \right \}$ from the transverse momentum conservation and flow are calculated. The interplay between the two effects is also investigated. Our results are in good agreement with the recent ATLAS measurements of multi-particle azimuthal correlations with the subevent cumulant method, which provides insight into the origin of collective flow in small systems.</description>

      <title>Dark matter, CE$\nu$NS and neutrino new physics scrutinized by a statistical method in Xenon-based experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter direct detection experiments are going to touch the neutrino floor with a good chance to measure coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) and a probe of neutrino-related new physics ($\nu$NP). In this study, we emphatically investigate the simultaneous presence of dark matter and $\nu$NP revealing a response resembling of Standard Model neutrino backgrounds in Xenon-based dark matter experiments. Demonstrated by three U(1) extension models, we figure out that dark matter signals can be distinguished from an excess or a depletion of neutrino contributions from $\nu$NP by a statistically defined distinction method in nuclear and electronic recoil spectra. We also present the influence of $\nu$NP on the exclusion limits for spin-independent dark matter-nucleon interactions. Our work might pave the way for new physics discrimination in future dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from basis light-front quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain all the leading-twist quark generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness within the basis light-front quantization framework. We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian in the valence Fock sector consisting of a three-dimensional confinement potential and a one-gluon exchange interaction with fixed coupling. We find that the qualitative behaviors of our GPDs are similar to those of other theoretical calculations. We further examine the GPDs within the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, $\sigma=\frac{1}{2} b^- P^+$, which is identified as the Fourier conjugate of the skewness. The GPDs in the $\sigma$-space show diffraction patterns, which are akin to the diffractive scattering of a wave in optics.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of quark-gluon plasma at finite temperature and chemical potential and QCD phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the shear viscosity of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in the full QCD phase diagram within the framework of kinetic theory with the relaxation time approximation based on the $2 \leftrightarrow 2$ elastic scatterings of quark quasiparticles. The temperature and chemical potential dependent masses of particles, including $u, d, s$ quarks, their antiparticles, and exchanged mesons, are calculated in the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona Lasinio (PNJL) model. The results indicate that, at small chemical potential, the value of $\eta/s$ has a minimum near the Mott dissociation of mesons and increases rapidly in the lower-temperature side of the chiral crossover phase transition. At large chemical potential (high density), $\eta/s$ in the QGP phase is dominated by the temperature, and the value of $\eta/s$ is greatly enhanced at lower temperature. At intermediate temperature and chemical potential near the QCD phase transition, the situation is relatively complicated. The behavior of $\eta/s$ is influenced by the competition between temperature, density effect, and QCD phase transition.</description>

      <title>DEMPgen: Physics event generator for Deep Exclusive Meson Production at Jefferson Lab and the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, as they provide access to Generalized Parton Distributions over a broad kinematic range, and are the only means of measuring pion and kaon charged electric form factors at high $Q^2$. Such investigations are a particularly useful tool in the study of hadronic structure in QCD's transition regime from long-distance interactions described in terms of meson-nucleon degrees of freedom, to short-dist ance interactions governed by hard quark-gluon degrees of freedom. To assist the planning of future experimental investigations of DEMP reactions in this transition regime, such as at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we have written a special purpose event generator, DEMPgen. Several types of DEMP reactions can be generated: $t$-channel $p(e,e^{\prime}\pi^+)n$, $p(e,e^{\prime}K^+)\Lambda[\Sigma^0]$, and $\vec{n}(e,e^{\prime}\pi^-)p$ from a polarized $^3$He target. DEMPgen is modular in form, so that additional reactions can be added over time. The generator produces kinematically-complete reaction events which are absolutely-normalized, so that projected event rates can be predicted, and detector resolution requirements studied. The event normalization is based on parameterizations of theoretical models, appropriate to the kinematic regime under study. Both fixed target modes and collider beam modes are supported. This paper presents the structure of the generator, the model parameterizations used for absolute event weighting, the kinematic distributions of the generated particles, some initial results using the generator, and instructions for its use.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk of this paper centers around the tension between confinement and freedom in QCD. I discuss how it can be understood heuristically as a manifestation of self-adhesive glue and how it fits within the larger contexts of energy-time uncertainty and $\textit{real virtuality}$. I discuss the possible emergence of $\textit{treeons}$ as a tangible ingredient of (at least) pure gluon $SU(3)$. I propose $\textit{flux channeling}$ as a method to address that and allied questions about triality flux numerically, and indicate how to implement it for electric and magnetic flux in material systems. That bulk is framed with broad-stroke, necessarily selective sketches of the past and possible future of strong interaction physics. At the end, I've added an expression of gratitude for my formative experience at the Erice school, in 1973.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent gluon distributions of proton within basis light-front quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gluon transverse-momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) are very important for revealing the internal structure of the proton. They correspond to a variety of experiments and are among the major tasks of the future electron-ion colliders. In this paper, we calculate the T-even gluon TMDs at the leading twist within the Basis Light-front Quantization framework. We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton obtained from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with Quantum Chromodynamics input determined for its valence Fock sector with three constituent quarks and an additional Fock sector, encompassing three quarks and a dynamical gluon, with a three-dimensional confinement. After obtaining the numerical results we investigate the properties of gluon TMDs by checking whether they satisfy the Mulders-Rodrigues inequalities and investigate the correlations between transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. With their connection to unintegrated gluon distributions in mind, we further investigate the limiting behaviours of gluon TMDs in the small-$x$ and large-$x$ regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperon within reconstructed jets in hadronic collisions offers a complementary platform to probe the polarized fragmentation function $D_{1T}^\perp$. We illustrate that by performing a global analysis of the transverse polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in different kinematic regions and in different hadronic collisions, such as $pp$, $p\bar p$, $pA$, and $\gamma A$ collisions, we can pin down the flavor dependence of $D_{1T}^\perp$ which has been poorly constrained. Besides the single inclusive jet production, the $\gamma/Z^0$-boson associated jet production supplements with more capability in removing ambiguities in the flavor dependence of $D_{1T}^\perp$.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 10$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 0.5$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Strategy to measure tau $g-2$ via photon fusion in LHC proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the tau-lepton ($\tau$) anomalous magnetic moment $a_\tau=(g_\tau-2)/2$ in photon fusion production ($\gamma\gamma\to\tau\tau$) tests foundational Standard Model principles. However, $\gamma\gamma\to\tau\tau$ eludes observation in LHC proton collisions (pp) despite enhanced new physics sensitivity from higher-mass reach than existing probes. We propose a novel strategy to measure $\text{pp}\to\text{p}(\gamma\gamma\to\tau\tau)\text{p}$ by introducing the overlooked electron-muon signature with vertex isolation for signal extraction. Applying the effective field theory of dipole moments, we estimate 95% CL sensitivity of $-0.0092&lt;a_{\tau}&lt;0.011$ assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity and 5% systematics. This fourfold improvement beyond existing constraints opens a crucial path to unveiling new physics imprinted in tau-lepton dipoles.</description>

      <title>The Phenomenology of Sphaleron in Modified Mirror Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate sphaleron solutions of the field equations in the modified mirror model. This model is based on SU(3)$_1$ $\otimes$ SU(3)$_2$ $\otimes$ SU(2)$_L$ $\otimes$ SU(2)$_R$ $\otimes$ U(1)$_{Y}$ $\otimes$ U(1)$_{X}$ gauge group. Different from the usual Weinberg-Salam theory, we will have two types of fields, the ordinary (standard model) and its mirror partners. In this paper, we will focus only on the case when the doublet scalar of the mirror sector has a very large vacuum expectation value (VEV) compared to the VEV of the SM Higgs. We study two scenarios related to the sphaleron solutions in this model, depending on the value of the coupling $\alpha$. For the case of $\alpha=0$, each sector has its sphaleron and the sphaleron energy depends on the VEV of scalars for each sector. In the case $\alpha \neq 0$, we find that the sphaleron energy in the SM sector can be either increased or decreased depending on the relative sign of the coupling $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>The role of the short-distance interaction in $e^+e^-\to \gamma X(3872)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the cross-section data from the $e^+e^-\to \gamma J/\psi\omega$ process to explore both short-distance and long-distance interactions for the radiative transition $Y(4200)\to \gamma X(3872)$. We investigate the short-distance effects through the E1 transition among the $c\bar{c}$ components, and the long-distance effects via hadronic loop diagrams. Our numerical analysis reveals that short-distance interactions play a significantly larger role in the radiative transition than that of the long-distance interactions. This finding underscores the importance of the compact $c\bar{c}$ components in both the initial and final states for accurately understanding the cross-section $\sigma[e^+e^-\to \gamma J/\psi\omega]$. Furthermore, with the help of relative branch ratio $\mathcal{R}$ we estimate the $\Gamma[Y(4200)\to\gamma X(3872)]$ implied in the the experimental study. Finally, we also discuss the possible existence of $\psi(4040)$ signal within the cross-section data.</description>

      <title>Nonleptonic three-body charmed baryon weak decays with H(15)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonleptonic three-body charmed baryon weak decays of $\mathbf{B}_{c}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}_{n}PP^{\prime}$ under the $SU(3)_{F}$ flavor symmetry, where $\mathbf{B}_{c}$ denotes the anti-triplet charmed baryon, comprising $(\Xi^{0}_{c},-\Xi^{+}_{c},\Lambda^{+}_{c})$, and $\mathbf{B}_{n}$ and $P(P^{\prime})$ represent octet baryon and pseudoscalar meson states, respectively. In addition to 12 parameters from the contributions of the color-antisymmetric part of the effective Hamiltonian, denoted as $H(\bar{\mathbf{6}})$, there are 4 parameters from the color-symmetric one, $H(\mathbf{15})$, which were not included in the previous study. With 16 parameters in total and 28 experimental data points, we obtain the minimal $\chi^2$ over degree of freedom of $\chi^{2}/d.o.f=1.5$, which is a great improvement comparing to that without $H(\mathbf{15})$. With the better fitting values, we evaluate the branching ratios and up-down asymmetries of $\mathbf{B}_{c}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}_{n}PP^{\prime}$, which present some interesting results such as $\mathcal{B}\,(\Lambda^{+}_{c}\rightarrow(\Xi(1690)^{0}\rightarrow\Sigma^{+}K^{-})\,K^{+})\equiv(1.5\pm0.4)\times10^{-3}$ and potential $SU(3)$ breaking effects in $\Xi^{+}_{c}\rightarrow p\pi^{+}K^{-}$ and $\Lambda^{+}_{c}\rightarrow \Sigma^{+}\pi^{-}K^{+}$ to be verified by the experiments at BESIII, Belle-II and LHCb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to identify whether a sterile neutrino is Dirac-type or Majorana-type by counting the peak of the rapidity distribution at lepton colliders. Our method requires only one charged-lepton tagging, and the nature of sterile neutrinos can be pinned down once they are confirmed.</description>

      <title>Study of dark matter scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei within chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dark matter, assumed to be composed by weak interacting massive particles (WIMPs), scattering off ${}^2$H and ${}^4$He nuclei. In order to parameterize the WIMP-nucleon interaction the chiral effective field theory approach is used. Considering only interactions invariant under parity, charge conjugation and time reversal, we examine five interaction types: scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial and tensor. Scattering amplitudes between two nucleons and a WIMP are determined up to second order of chiral perturbation theory. We apply this program to calculate the interaction rate as function of the WIMP mass and of the magnitude of the WIMP-quark coupling constants. From our study, we conclude that the scalar nuclear response functions result much greater than the others due to theirs large combination of low energy constants. We verify that the leading order contributions are dominant in this low energy processes. We also provide an estimate for the background due to atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Energy loss of a heavy fermion in a collisional QED plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the energy loss of heavy fermions moving in a plasma, taking into account the modification of the photon collective modes induced by collisions using a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collisional kernel. We include contributions from both hard and soft scatterings of the heavy fermion using a collisionally modified hard-thermal-loop resummed propagator. Using this method, one does not need to introduce a separation scale between hard- and soft-momentum exchanges. To place our calculation in context, we review other theoretical approaches to computing the collisional energy loss of fermions and discuss the systematics and results obtained in each approach compared to using a resummed propagator for both hard and soft momentum exchanges. Our final results indicate that self-consistently including the effect of collisions in the self-energies of the resummed propagator results in an increased energy loss compared to using collisionless hard-thermal-loop propagators. The effect becomes larger as the magnitude of the coupling constant and the velocity of the fermion increase.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the convergence of expansions at finite baryon chemical potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convergence of three different expansion schemes at finite baryon chemical potentials, including the conventional Taylor expansion, the Pad\'e approximants, and the $T'$ expansion proposed recently in lattice QCD simulations, have been investigated in a low energy effective theory within the fRG approach. It is found that the $T'$ expansion or the Pad\'e approximants would hardly improve the convergence of expansion in comparison to the conventional Taylor expansion, within the expansion orders considered in this work. Furthermore, we find that the consistent regions of the three different expansions are in agreement with the convergence radius of the Lee-Yang edge singularities.</description>

      <title>NLO+NLL' accurate predictions for three-jet event shapes in hadronic Higgs decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present resummed predictions at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy matched to the exact next-to-leading order results for a set of classical event-shape observables in hadronic Higgs decays, i.e., for the channels $H\to gg$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$. We furthermore consider soft-drop grooming of the hadronic final states and derive corresponding $\text{NLO}+\text{NLL}^\prime$ predictions for the groomed thrust observable. Differences in the QCD radiation pattern of gluon- and quark-initiated final states are imprinted in the event-shape distributions, offering separation power for the two decay channels. In particular, we show that ungroomed event shapes in $H\to gg$ decays develop a considerably harder spectrum than in $H\to b\bar b$ decays. We highlight that soft-drop grooming can substantially alter this behaviour, unless rather inclusive grooming parameters are chosen.</description>

      <title>Gluon Double-Spin Asymmetry in the Longitudinally Polarized $p+p$ Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the first-ever small-$x$ expression for the inclusive gluon production cross section in the central rapidity region of the longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions. The cross section depends on the polarizations of both protons, therefore comprising the numerator of the longitudinal double-spin asymmetry $A_{LL}$ for the produced gluons. The cross section is calculated in the shock wave formalism and is expressed in terms of the polarized dipole scattering amplitudes on the projectile and target protons. We show that the small-$x$ evolution corrections are included into our cross section expression if one evolves these polarized dipole amplitudes using the double-logarithmic helicity evolution derived in \cite{Kovchegov:2015pbl, Kovchegov:2016zex, Kovchegov:2018znm, Cougoulic:2022gbk}. Our calculation is performed for the gluon sector only, with the quark contribution left for future work. When that work is complete, the resulting formula will be applicable to longitudinally polarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions, as well as to polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) on a proton or a nucleus. Our results should allow one to extend the small-$x$ helicity phenomenology analysis of \cite{Adamiak:2023yhz} to the jet/hadron production data reported for the longitudinally polarized proton-proton collisions at RHIC and to polarized SIDIS measurements at central rapidities to be performed at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Search for anti-quark nuggets via their interaction with the LHC beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anti-quark nuggets (AQNs) have been suggested to solve the dark matter (DM) and the missing antimatter problem in the universe and have been proposed as an explanation of various observations. Their size is in the {\mu}m range and their density is about equal to the nuclear density with an expected flux of about $0.4 / km^2 / year$. For the typical velocity of DM constituents ($\sim$250 km/s), the solar system bodies act as highly performing gravitational lenses. Here we assume that DM streams or clusters are impinging, e.g., on the Earth, as it was worked out for DM axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Interestingly, in the LHC beam, unforeseen beam losses are triggered by so-called Unidentified Falling Objects (UFOs), which are believed to be constituted of dust particles with a size in the {\mu}m range and a density of several orders of magnitude lower than AQNs. Prezeau suggested that streaming DM constituents incident on the Earth should result in jet-like structures ("hairs") exiting the Earth, or a kind of caustics. Such ideas open novel directions in the search for DM. This work suggests a new analysis of the UFO results at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming that they are eventually, at least partly, due to AQNs. Firstly, a reanalysis of the existing data from the 4000 beam monitors since the beginning of the LHC is proposed, arguing that dust and AQNs should behave differently. The feasibility of this idea has been discussed with CERN accelerator people and potential collaborators.</description>

      <title>Propagation speeds of relativistic conformal fluids from a generalized relaxation time approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the propagation speeds for a conformal real relativistic fluid. We begin from a kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation, where the relaxation time is an arbitrary function of the particle energy in the Landau frame. We propose a parameterization of the one particle distribution function designed to contain a second order Chapman-Enskog solution as a particular case. We derive the hydrodynamic equations applying the moments method to this parameterized one particle distribution function, and solve for the propagation speeds of linearized scalar, vector and tensor perturbations. For relaxation times of the form $\tau=\tau_0(-\beta_{\mu}p^{\mu})^{-a}$, with $-\infty&lt; a&lt;2$, where $\beta_{\mu}=u_{\mu}/T$ is the temperature vector in the Landau frame, we show that the Anderson-Witting prescription $a=1$ yields the fastest speeds.</description>

      <title>Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Accessing the speed of sound in relativistic ultracentral nucleus-nucleus collisions using the mean transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that the speed of sound of the strong interaction at high temperature can be measured using the variation of the mean transverse momentum with the particle multiplicity in ultracentral heavy-ion collisions. We test this correspondence by running hydrodynamic simulations at zero impact parameter with several equations of state, at several colliding energies from 0.2 TeV to 15 TeV per nucleon pair. The correspondence is found to be precise and robust for a smooth, boost-invariant fluid and an ideal detector. We discuss the differences between this ideal setup and an actual experiment. We conclude that the extraction of the speed of sound from data is reliable, and that the main uncertainty comes from our poor knowledge of the distribution of density fluctuations at the early stages of the collision.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the possibility to observe neutrinos emitted from a failed core collapse Supernova in the various experiments at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. We show that the veto regions of dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments can be used as a network of small detectors to measure Supernova neutrinos. In addition we show that this network can measure very precisely the moment of black hole formation, which can be then used in the nearby VIRGO detector and future Einstein Telescope to look for the gravitational wave counterpart to the neutrino signal.</description>

      <title>From S-matrix theory to strings: Scattering data and the commitment to non-arbitrariness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early history of string theory is marked by a shift from strong interaction physics to quantum gravity. The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the "hadronic string theory"), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to "non-arbitrariness", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory.</description>

      <title>Injection spectra of different species of cosmic rays from AMS-02, ACE-CRIS and Voyager-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of energy spectra of different cosmic ray species were obtained in recent years, by particularly the AMS-02 experiment on the International Space Station. It has been shown that apparent differences exist in different groups of the primary cosmic rays. However, it is not straightforward to conclude that the source spectra of different particle groups are different since they will experience different propagation processes (e.g., energy losses and fragmentations) either. In this work, we study the injection spectra of different nuclear species using the measurements from Voyager-1 outside the solar system, and ACR-CRIS and AMS-02 on top of atmosphere, in a physical framework of cosmic ray transportation. Two types of injection spectra are assumed, the broken power-law and the non-parametric spline interpolation form. The non-parametric form fits the data better than the broken power-law form, implying that potential structures beyond the constrained spectral shape of broken power-law may exist. For different nuclei the injection spectra are overall similar in shape but do show some differences among each other. For the non-parametric spectral form, the helium injection spectrum is the softest at low energies and the hardest at high energies. For both spectral shapes, the low-energy injection spectrum of neon is the hardest among all these species, and the carbon and oxygen spectra have more prominent bumps in 1-10 GV in the R2dN/dR presentation. Such differences suggest the existence of differences in the sources or acceleration processes of various nuclei of cosmic rays.</description>

Abstract: We put forward a concrete experimental setup allowing to measure light-by-light scattering in the collision of two optical high-intensity laser beams at state-of-the-art high-field facilities operating petawatt class laser systems. Our setup uses the same focusing optics for both laser beams to be collided and employs a dark-field approach for the detection of the single-photon-level nonlinear quantum vacuum response in the presence of a large background. Based on an advanced modeling of the colliding laser fields, we in particular provide reliable estimates for the prospective numbers of signal photons scattered into the dark-field for various laser polarizations.</description>

      <title>Topological solitons stabilized by a background gauge field and soliton-anti-soliton asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological lumps supported by the second homotopy group $\pi_2(S^2) \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ in a gauged $O(3)$ model without any potential term coupled with a (non)dynamical $U(1)$ gauge field. It is known that gauged-lumps are stable with an easy-plane potential term but are unstable to expand if the model has no potential term. In this paper, we find that these gauged lumps without a potential term can be made stable by putting them in a uniform magnetic field, irrespective of whether the gauge field is dynamical or not. In the case of the non-dynamical gauge field, only either of lumps or anti-lumps stably exists depending on the sign of the background magnetic field, and the other is unstable to shrink to be singular. We also construct coaxial multiple lumps whose size and mass exhibit a behaviour of droplets. In the case of the dynamical gauge field, both the lumps and anti-lumps stably exist with different masses; the lighter (heavier) one corresponds to the (un)stable one in the case of the nondynamical gauge field. We find that a lump behaves as a superconducting ring and traps magnetic field in its inside, with the total magnetic field reduced from the background magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Bjorken and threshold limit of a space-like structure function in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate a simple coordinate-space structure function $f_a(z^2m^2,\lambda)$ in the 2D $U(N)$ Gross-Neveu model to next-to-leading order in the large $N$ expansion. We analytically perform the twist expansion in the Bjorken limit through double Mellin-representations. Hard and non-perturbative scaling functions at leading and next-to-leading powers are naturally generated in their Borel representations. At leading power (LP), the factorization formula is explicitly verified, and the issue of ``scale-dependency'' of perturbative and non-perturbative functions is explained naturally. At NLP, there are three series of non-perturbative functions and the related hard functions. The renormalon cancellation pattern between the hard function at LP and the non-perturbative function at NLP is verified explicitly. We also investigate the threshold expansion of the structure function and its relation to the twist expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase-space of homogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes within symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity. Specifically, we consider the Kantowski-Sachs and locally rotational Bianchi III geometries to describe the physical space. By analyzing the phase-space, we reconstruct the cosmological history dictated by $f(Q)$-gravity and comment about the theory's viability. Our findings suggest that the free parameters of the connection must be constrained to eliminate nonlinear terms in the field equations. Consequently, new stationary points emerge, rendering the theory cosmologically viable. We identify the existence of anisotropic accelerated universes, which may correspond to the pre-inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>New aspect of chiral and axial breaking in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violation of the $U(1)$ axial symmetry in QCD is stricter than the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, simply because of the presence of the quantum axial anomaly. If the QCD gauge coupling is sent to zero, the strength of the $U(1)$ axial breaking coincides with that of the chiral $SU(2)$ breaking, which we shall in short call an axial-chiral coincidence. This coincidence is trivial since QCD then becomes a non-interacting theory. Actually, there exists another limit in the QCD parameter space, where an axial-chiral coincidence occurs even with nonzero QCD gauge coupling, that can be dubbed a nontrivial coincidence: it is the case with the massive light quarks $(m_l\neq 0)$ and the massless strange quark ($m_s=0$), due to the flavor-singlet nature of the topological susceptibility. This coincidence is robust and tied to the anomalous chiral Ward-Takahashi identity, which is operative even at hot QCD. This implies that the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry is restored simultaneously with the $U(1)$ axial symmetry at high temperatures. This simultaneous restoration is independent of $m_l (\neq 0)$, hence is irrespective to the order of the chiral phase transition. In this paper, we discuss how the real-life QCD can be evolved from the nontrivial chiral-axial coincidence limit, by working on a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with the $U(1)$ axial anomaly contribution properly incorporated. It is shown that at high temperatures the large differences between the restorations of the chiral $SU(2)$ symmetry and the $U(1)$ axial symmetry for two light quarks and a sufficiently large current mass for the strange quark is induced by a significant interference of the topological susceptibility. Thus the deviation from the nontrivial coincidence, which is monitored by the strange quark mass controlling the topological susceptibility, provides a new way of understanding the chiral $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ axial breaking in QCD.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark pair production at lepton colliders at NNNLO in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the total cross-section and invariant mass distribution for heavy-quark pair production in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. The obtained results are expressed as piecewise functions defined by several deeply expanded power series, facilitating a rapid numerical evaluation. Utilizing top-pair production at a collision energy of 500 GeV as a benchmark, we observe a correction of approximately $0.1\%$ for the total cross-section and around $10\%$ for the majority of the invariant mass distribution range. These results play a crucial role in significantly reducing theoretical uncertainty: the scale dependence has been diminished to $0.06\%$ for the total cross-section and to $5\%$ for the invariant mass distribution. This reduction of uncertainty meets the stringent requirements of future lepton colliders.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of neutral current Drell-Yan production at large invariant dilepton masses can be used to test the energy scale dependence (running) of the electroweak mixing angle. In this work, we make use of a novel implementation of the full next-to-leading order electroweak radiative corrections to the Drell-Yan process using the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ renormalization scheme for the electroweak mixing angle. The potential of future analyses using proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6~\mathrm{TeV}$ in the Run 3 and High-Luminosity phases of the LHC is explored. In this way, the Standard Model predictions for the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ running at $\mathrm{TeV}$ scales can be probed.</description>

More observables, which can be measured at BESIII and possibly at LHCb, are also suggested.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Transition Form Factors of Baryon Resonances</title>

Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical advancements have led to significant progress in our understanding of the electromagnetic structure of nucleons ($N$), nucleon excitations ($N^\ast$), and other baryons. These breakthroughs have been made possible by the capabilities of modern facilities, enabling the induction of photo- and electro-excitation of nucleon resonances. Recent experimental advances have sparked notable developments in theoretical approaches. New theoretical methods have been tested and proven to be robust, marking the beginning of a new era in our understanding on baryons. We present a comprehensive review of progress in experimental data on $\gamma^\ast N \to N^\ast$ reactions. Additionally, we discuss various analyses and theoretical results. Some of these methods have matured in their predictive power, offering new perspectives on exotic hadrons with multiquark components. We place special emphasis on both the low-$Q^2$ and large-$Q^2$ regions to reinforce crucial physical constraints on observables that hold in these limits. Furthermore, we illustrate that the combination of lattice QCD with chiral effective field theory and quark models, respectively, proves beneficial in interpreting data and applying constraints within those different regimes. As a practical contribution and for future reference, we review the formulas for helicity amplitudes, multipole form factors and the relations between these two sets of functions for transitions to resonances with general spin $J \geq \frac{1}{2}$. These formulas are ubiquitous and play a pivotal role in experimental and theoretical studies on baryon structure. Notably, the multipole transition form factors for $J \ge \frac{3}{2}$ resonances serve as valuable tools to test perturbative QCD results in the large-$Q^2$ region, thanks to the correlations between electric and magnetic transition form factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to probe primordial inhomogeneity in hot and dense matter which could be realized in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Although the Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry is commonly used to infer the system size, the cluster size should be detected if substructures emerge in space. We demonstrate that a signal peak in the HBT two-particle correlation stands at the relative momentum corresponding to the spatial scale of pseudo one-dimensional modulation. We assess detectability using the data prepared by an event generator (AMPT model) with clustering implemented in the particle distribution.</description>

Abstract: The impact of recent LHC top-quark pair production single differential cross section measurements at 13 TeV collision energy on the structure of the proton is explored. In particular, the impact of these high-precision data on the gluon and other parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton at intermediate and large partonic momentum fraction $x$ is analyzed. This study extends the CT18 global analysis framework to include these new data. The interplay between top-quark pair and inclusive jet production as well as other processes at the LHC, is studied. In addition, a study of the impact of scale choice on the theory description of the new 13 TeV $t\bar t$ measurements is performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We newly develop a renormalization group (RG) improvement for thermally resummed effective potentials. In this method, $\beta$-functions are consistently defined in resummed perturbation theories, so that order-by-order RG invariance is not spoiled after thermal resummation. With this improvement, scale dependences of phase transition quantities such as a critical temperature, which are known to be notoriously large at the one-loop order, are greatly reduced compared to calculations with the conventional $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme. By taking advantage of the RG invariance, we also devise a resummation method that can incorporate potentially harmful large logarithmic terms and temperature-dependent power corrections in a generic form. We point out that a resummed one-loop effective potential refined by the method can give results that agree with those obtained by resummed two-loop effective potentials within errors.</description>

      <title>LHC Study of Third-Generation Scalar Leptoquarks with Machine-Learned Likelihoods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of machine-learning algorithms on LHC searches for leptoquarks in final states with hadronically decaying tau leptons, multiple $b$-jets, and large missing transverse momentum. Pair production of scalar leptoquarks with decays only into third-generation leptons and quarks is assumed. Thanks to the use of supervised learning tools with unbinned methods to handle the high-dimensional final states, we consider simple selection cuts which would possibly translate into an improvement in the exclusion limits at the 95$\%$ confidence level for leptoquark masses with different values of their branching fraction into charged leptons. In particular, for intermediate branching fractions, we expect that the exclusion limits for leptoquark masses extend to $\sim$1.3 TeV. As a novelty in the implemented unbinned analysis, we include a simplified estimation of some systematic uncertainties with the aim of studying their possible impact on the stability of the results. Finally, we also present the projected sensitivity within this framework at 14 TeV for 300 and 3000 fb$^{-1}$ that extends the upper limits to $\sim$1.6 and $\sim$1.8 TeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Capping the positivity cone: dimension-8 Higgs operators in the SMEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SMEFT Wilson coefficients are subject to various positivity bounds in order to be consistent with the fundamental principles of S-matrix. Previous bounds on dimension-8 SMEFT operators have been obtained using the positivity part of UV partial wave unitarity and form a (projective) convex cone. We derive a set of linear UV unitarity conditions that go beyond positivity and are easy to implement in an optimization scheme with dispersion relations in a multi-field EFT. Using Higgs scattering as an example, we demonstrate how to obtain closed bounds in the space of the three relevant dimension-8 coefficients, making use of the UV unitarity conditions as well as so-called null constraints that arise from full crossing symmetry. Specifically, we show that they are bounded by inequalities schematically going like $C&lt;O\left((4\pi)^2\right)$. We compare the newly obtained upper bounds with the traditional perturbative unitarity bounds from within the EFT, and discuss some phenomenological implications of the two-sided positivity bounds in the context of experimental probes of Vector Boson Scattering.</description>

Abstract: Recently the ATLAS collaboration has reported the first results of searches for heavy scalar resonances decaying into a $Z$ boson and a lighter new scalar resonance, where the $Z$ boson decays leptonically and the lighter scalar decays into a top-quark pair, giving rise to $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$ final states. This had previously been identified as a smoking-gun signature at the LHC for a first-order electroweak phase transition (FOEWPT) within the framework of two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs). In addition, ATLAS also presented new limits where the $Z$ boson decays into pairs of neutrinos and the lighter scalar resonance into bottom-quark pairs, giving rise to the $\nu \nu b \bar b$ final state. We analyze the impact of these new searches on the 2HDM parameter space, with emphasis on their capability to probe currently allowed 2HDM regions featuring a strong FOEWPT. We also study the complementarity of these new searches with other LHC probes that could target the FOEWPT region of the 2HDM. Remarkably, the ATLAS search in the $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$ final state shows a local $2.85\,\sigma$ excess (for masses of about 650 GeV and 450 GeV for the heavy and light resonance) in the 2HDM parameter region that would yield a FOEWPT in the early universe, which could constitute the first experimental hint of baryogenesis at the electroweak scale. We analyze the implications of this excess, and discuss the detectability prospects for the associated gravitational wave signal from the FOEWPT. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity reach of the $\ell^+ \ell^- t \bar{t}$ signature for the upcoming runs of the LHC. Finally, we introduce the python package thdmTools, a state-of-art tool for the exploration of the 2HDM.</description>

      <title>Decipher the width of the $X(3872)$ via the QCD sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we take the $X(3872)$ as the hidden-charm tetraquark state with both isospin $I=0$ and $1$ components, then investigate the strong decays $X(3872)\to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$, $J/\psi\omega$, $\chi_{c1}\pi^0$, $D^{*0}\bar{D}^0$ and $D^{0}\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ with the QCD sum rules. We take account of all the Feynman diagrams, and acquire four QCD sum rules based on rigorous quark-hadron duality. We obtain the total decay width about $1\,\rm{MeV}$, which is in excellent agreement with the experiment data $ \Gamma_{X}=1.19\pm 0.21\,\rm{MeV}$ from the Particle Data Group, it is the first time to reproduce the tiny width of the $X(3872)$ via the QCD sum rules, which supports assigning the $X(3872)$ as the hidden-charm tetraquark state with the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive constraints on heavy sterile neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae</title>

Abstract: Sterile neutrinos with masses up to $\mathcal{O} (100)$ MeV can be copiously produced in a supernova (SN) core, through the mixing with active neutrinos. In this regard the SN 1987A detection of neutrino events has been used to put constraints on active-sterile neutrino mixing, exploiting the well-known SN cooling argument. We refine the calculation of this limit including neutral current interactions with nucleons, that constitute the dominant channel for sterile neutrino production. We also include, for the first time, the charged current interactions between sterile neutrinos and muons, relevant for the production of sterile neutrinos mixed with muon neutrinos in the SN core. Using the recent modified luminosity criterion, we extend the bounds to the case where sterile states are trapped in the stellar core. Additionally, we study the decays of heavy sterile neutrinos, affecting the SN explosion energy and possibly producing a gamma-ray signal. We also illustrate the complementarity of our new bounds with cosmological bounds and laboratory searches.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like ultralight dark matter from observations of the HL Tauri protoplanetary disk</title>

Abstract: Dark matter may consist of axion-like particles (ALPs). When polarized electromagnetic radiation passes through the dark-matter media, interaction with background ALPs affects the polarization of photons. The condensate of axionic dark matter experiences periodic oscillations, and the period of the oscillations is of order of years for ultra-light dark matter. This would result in observable periodic changes in the polarization plane, determined by the phases of the ALP field at the Earth and at the source. In this paper, we use recent polarimetric observations of the HL Tauri protoplanetary disk performed in different years to demonstrate the lack of changes of polarization angles, and hence to constrain masses and photon couplings of the hypothetical axion-like ultralight dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effect of isospin-violating dark matter-nucleon interactions on direct detection constraints in the regime of small dark matter mass and large scattering cross section. Isospin-violation can lead to both reductions in sensitivity (due to a reduced cross section for scattering with nuclei in the detector) and enhancements in sensitivity (due to a reduced cross section for scattering in the overburden). Isospin-violating effects can thus open up some closed regions of parameter space, while closing off other regions.</description>

      <title>Light-by-Light Scattering at Next-to-Leading Order in QCD and QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of Light-by-Light (LbL) scattering at the Large Hadron Collider has revived interest in this fundamental process, and especially of the accurate prediction of its cross-section, which we present here for the first time at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in both QCD and QED. We compare two radically different computational approaches, both exact in the fermion mass dependence, thus offering a strong cross-check of our results. The first approach is a fully analytic method to calculate compact and well-organized two-loop helicity amplitudes. The second one is entirely numerical and leverages the Local Unitarity construction. Our two calculations agree with each other and conclude that including the exact fermion mass contribution typically increases the size of the NLO corrections. Moreover, we find that the exact result converges slowly to the massless limit of the high-energy regime, thus emphasizing the importance of including the full mass dependence at NLO. We also compare our results with the ATLAS measurement of LbL in ultra-peripheral lead-lead collisions, and find that the inclusion of exact NLO corrections reduces, but does not eliminate, the existing tension with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Charged-current non-standard neutrino interactions at Daya Bay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full data set of the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment is used to probe the effect of the charged current non-standard interactions (CC-NSI) on neutrino oscillation experiments. Two different approaches are applied and constraints on the corresponding CC-NSI parameters are obtained with the neutrino flux taken from the Huber-Mueller model with a $5\%$ uncertainty. For the quantum mechanics-based approach (QM-NSI), the constraints on the CC-NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\alpha}$ and $\epsilon_{e\alpha}^{s}$ are extracted with and without the assumption that the effects of the new physics are the same in the production and detection processes, respectively. The approach based on the effective field theory (EFT-NSI) deals with four types of CC-NSI represented by the parameters $[\varepsilon_{X}]_{e\alpha}$. For both approaches, the results for the CC-NSI parameters are shown for cases with various fixed values of the CC-NSI and the Dirac CP-violating phases, and when they are allowed to vary freely. We find that constraints on the QM-NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\alpha}$ and $\epsilon_{e\alpha}^{s}$ from the Daya Bay experiment alone can reach the order $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$ for the former and $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the latter, while for EFT-NSI parameters $[\varepsilon_{X}]_{e\alpha}$, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for both cases.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Axion Domain Wall Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD axion can solve the Strong CP Problem and be the dark matter of our universe. If the PQ symmetry breaking scale associated with the axion is below the inflationary reheating temperature, axion strings and domain walls populate the universe. Most of these strings and walls decay away into axion dark matter, but a small subset of the walls will be self-enclosed surfaces that are not attached to any strings. These enclosed walls can collapse in on themselves, compressing a large amount of energy into a small volume and potentially forming primordial black holes (PBHs). We study the number density and dynamics of these self-enclosed walls, taking into account their size distribution, Hubble expansion, asphericities, and all stages of domain wall dynamics using a combination of semi-analytic and numerical approaches. We find that axion models with a high axion decay constant $f_a$, such as those of interest in early matter-dominated cosmologies, yield a PBH abundance potentially observable by future gravitational lensing surveys. We note that the formalism developed here is also useful for predicting relic PBH abundances in other models that exhibit unstable domain walls.</description>

      <title>Investigating the M1 radiative decay behaviors and the magnetic moments of the predicted triple-charm molecular-type pentaquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electromagnetic properties including the M1 radiative decay widths and the magnetic moments of the isoscalar $\Xi_{c c} D^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}D_{1}$, and $\Xi_{cc}D_{2}^{*}$ triple-charm molecular-type pentaquark candidates, where we adopt the constituent quark model and consider both the $S$-$D$ wave mixing effect and the coupled channel effect. Our numerical results suggest that the M1 radiative decay widths and the magnetic moments of the isoscalar $\Xi_{c c} D^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}D_{1}$, and $\Xi_{cc}D_{2}^{*}$ triple-charm molecular-type pentaquark candidates can reflect their inner structures, and the study of the electromagnetic properties is the important step to construct the family of the triple-charm molecular-type pentaquarks. With the accumulation of the experimental data during the high-luminosity phase of LHC, we expect that the present work combined with the corresponding mass spectrum information can encourage the experimental colleagues at LHCb to focus on the isoscalar $\Xi_{c c} D^{(*)}$, $\Xi_{cc}D_{1}$, and $\Xi_{cc}D_{2}^{*}$ triple-charm molecular-type pentaquark candidates.</description>

Abstract: We present a minimal framework that realises successful Dirac Leptogenesis through the Affleck-Dine mechanism. A single right-handed neutrino and a neutrinophillic Higgs doublet are introduced to the Standard Model, which couple via a Yukawa interaction. The inflationary setting is induced by a combination of the two Higgs doublets, with their global symmetry violating interactions leading to a net charge generation via the Affleck-Dine mechanism. This simple Standard Model extension exhibits a unique and connected set of phenomenological implications including the resultant baryon asymmetry, inflationary predictions, cosmological implications, relic right-handed neutrinos, and its low energy phenomenology, while also being able to be embedded in various neutrino mass generating mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Probing Light Inelastic Dark Matter from Direct Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Different dark matter (DM) candidates could have different types of DM-lepton and/or DM-quark interactions. For direct detection experiments, this leads to diversity in the recoil spectra, where both DM-electron and DM-nucleus scatterings may contribute. Furthermore, kinematic effects such as those of the inelastic scattering can also play an important role in shaping the recoil spectra. In this work, we systematically study signatures of the light exothermic inelastic DM from the recoil spectra including both the DM-electron scattering and Migdal effect. Such inelastic DM has mass around (sub-)GeV scale and the DM mass-splitting ranges from 1keV to 30keV. We analyze the direct detection sensitivities to such light inelastic DM. For different inelastic DM masses and mass-splittings, we find that the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect can contribute significantly and differently to the direct detection signatures. Hence, it is important to perform combined analysis to include both the DM-electron recoil and Migdal effect. We further demonstrate that this analysis has strong impacts on the cosmological and laboratory bounds for the inelastic DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the tensor polarization and the resulted spin alignment of a generic vector meson in local equilibrium up to the first order in hydrodynamic gradients using thermal field theory with dissipative effects incorporated. Several new contributions, including a novel shear-induced tensor polarization (SITP), are discovered and turn out sensitive to the in-medium spectral properties of the vector mesons. The phenomenological study reveals that these contributions, especially SITP, could generate substantial spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions, and potentially helps us to understand the large spin alignment observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Using Pulsar Parameter Drifts to Detect Sub-Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves with frequencies below 1~nHz are notoriously difficult to detect. With periods exceeding current experimental lifetimes, they induce slow drifts in observables rather than periodic correlations. Observables with well-known intrinsic contributions provide a means to probe this regime. In this work, we demonstrate the viability of using observed pulsar timing parameters to discover such "ultralow" frequency gravitational waves, presenting two complementary observables for which the systematic shift induced by ultralow-frequency gravitational waves can be extracted. Using existing data for these parameters, we search the ultralow frequency regime for continuous-wave signals, finding a sensitivity near the expected prediction from inspirals of supermassive black holes. We do not see an excess in the data, setting a limit on the strain of $ 1.3 \times 10 ^{ - 12} $ at $ 450~{\rm pHz} $ with a sensitivity dropping approximately quadratically with frequency until $ 10~{\rm pHz}$. Our search method opens a new frequency range for gravitational wave detection and has profound implications for astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Cluster formation near midrapidity -- can the mechanism be identified experimentally?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12019v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of weakly bound clusters in the hot and dense environment at midrapidity is one of the surprising phenomena observed experimentally in heavy-ion collisions from a low center of mass energy of a few GeV up to a ultra-relativistic energy of several TeV. Three approaches have been advanced to describe the cluster formation: coalescence at kinetic freeze-out, cluster formation during the entire heavy-ion collision by potential interaction between nucleons and deuteron production by hadronic reactions. We identify experimental observables, which can discriminate these production mechanisms for deuterons.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIa. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}$ - $E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Influences of tilted thin accretion disks on the observational appearance of hairy black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on the observational appearance of black holes, both in general relativity and modified gravity, has been in full swing since the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration announced photos of M87$^{*}$ and Sagittarius A$^{*}$. Nevertheless, limited attention has been given to the impact of tilted accretion disks on black hole images. This paper investigates the $230$ GHz images of non-rotating hairy black holes illuminated by tilted, thin accretion disks in Horndeski gravity with the aid of a ray tracing method. The results indicate that reducing the scalar hair parameter effectively diminishes image luminosity and extends both the critical curve and the inner shadow. This trend facilitates the differentiation between hairy black holes and Schwarzschild black holes, especially in certain parameter spaces where the current Event Horizon Telescope array is capable of capturing such variations. Furthermore, we observe that the inclination of the tilted accretion disk can mimic the observation angle, consequently affecting image brightness and the morphology of the inner shadow. In specific parameter spaces, alterations in the tilt or position of the accretion disk can lead to a drift in the light spot within the images of hairy black holes. This finding may establish a potential correlation between the precession of the tilted accretion disk and image features. Additionally, through an examination of images depicting hairy black holes surrounded by two thin accretion disks, we report the obscuring effect of the accretion environment on the inner shadow of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on interactions between dark energy and dark matter with momentum and energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We place observational constraints on a dark energy (DE) model in which a quintessence scalar field $\phi$ is coupled to dark matter (DM) through momentum and energy exchanges.The momentum transfer is weighed by an interaction between the field derivative and DM four velocity with a coupling constant $\beta$, whereas the energy exchange is characterized by an exponential scalar-field coupling to the DM density with a coupling constant $Q$. A positive coupling $\beta$ leads to the suppression for the growth of DM density perturbations at low redshifts, whose property offers a possibility for resolving the $\sigma_8$ tension problem. A negative coupling $Q$ gives rise to a $\phi$-matter-dominated epoch, whose presence can reduce the sound horizon around the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) decoupling epoch. Using the data of Planck 2018, 12-th Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Phantheon supernovae samples, and 1-year dark energy survey, we find that the two couplings are constrained to be $\beta=0.332^{+1.246}_{-0.237}$ and $Q =-0.0312^{+0.0312}_{-0.0085}$ at 68\,\% confidence level (CL). Thus, there is an interesting observational signature of the momentum exchange ($\beta \neq 0$) between DE and DM, with a peak of the probability distribution of the energy transfer coupling at $Q&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Rapidity scan approach for net-baryon cumulants with a statistical thermal model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing rapidity-dependent measurements to map the QCD phase diagram provides a complementary approach to traditional beam-energy-dependent measurements around midrapidity. The changing nature of thermodynamic properties of QCD matter along the beam axis in heavy-ion collisions at low collision energies both motivates and poses challenges for this method. In this study, we derive the analytical cumulant-generating function for subsystems within distinct rapidity windows, while accounting for global net-baryon charge conservation of the full system. Rapidity-dependent net-baryon cumulants are then calculated for a system exhibiting inhomogeneity along the beam axis, and their sensitivity to finite acceptances through changing rapidity bin widths is explored. We highlight the nontrivial behaviors exhibited by these cumulants, underscoring their importance in establishing a noncritical baseline for interpreting net-proton cumulants in the search for the QCD critical point. Finally, we discuss the implications of the rapidity scan for mapping the QCD phase diagram within the current context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method to compute the gravitational form factor $D(Q^2)$ in holographic QCD by exploiting the remarkable correspondence between semi-classical light-front QCD and semi-classical field theories in wrapped spacetime in 5D. The use of light-front holography bridges physics at large $Q^2$ as attained in light-front QCD and physics at small $Q^2$ where the coupling to scalar and tensor fields, i.e. glueballs, are dominant. As an application, we compute the $D$-term for the pion, and compare the results with recent lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Observables from classical black hole scattering in Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity from worldline quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we compute the two observables, impulse and waveform, in a black hole scattering event for the Scalar-Tensor theory of gravity with a generic scalar potential using the techniques of Worldline Quantum Field Theory. We mainly investigate the corrections to the above mentioned observables due to the extra scalar degree of freedom. For the computation of impulse, we consider the most general scenario by making the scalar field massive and then show that each computed diagram has a smooth massless limit. We compute the waveform for scalar and graviton up to 2PM, taking the scalar as massless. Furthermore, we discuss if the scalar has mass and how the radiation integrals get more involved than the massless case. We also arrive at some analytical results using stationary phase approximation. Interestingly, we also show that the $\lambda_4 \varphi^4$ interaction vertex does not contribute to the radiation by showing that the integral has no non-zero finite value.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>An analytical approximation of the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation in the ultraslow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation can enter an ultraslow-roll (USR) stage, if there is a plateau on the inflaton potential. During this stage, the primordial curvature perturbation ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its power spectrum ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ can be remarkably enhanced on small scales. In this work, an analytical approximation is provided to systematically study the evolution of ${\mathcal R}_k$ in the USR inflation. We first discuss the asymptotic solutions of the moduli and arguments of ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its time derivative ${\mathcal R}_{k,N}$ on the sub- and super-horizon scales separately and find that all these solutions have simple exponential forms. Then, ${\mathcal R}_k$ on five typical scales are investigated in order. Our analytical approximation predicts that ${\mathcal R}_k$ first revolves around the origin in the complex plane, but if it crosses the horizon around the start of the USR stage, there appears a subsequent linear evolution towards or away from the origin. This behavior naturally explains the shape of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ from the sharp dip to the peak and matches the numerical results perfectly. Moreover, the minimum of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ is exactly proved to be nonvanishing. Our analytical approximation will help the model building in primordial black hole and gravitational wave physics.</description>
