      <title>Pinball: A Cryogenic Predecoder for Quantum Error Correction Decoding Under Circuit-Level Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle common, sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources present in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below a useful level in practical scenarios. Furthermore, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.
  To address these shortcomings, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22 nm FDSOI technology, we achieve a peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 4 K power budget of 1.5 W, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.</description>

      <title>Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and Pickup-Delivery: integrating classical and quantum optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and Pickup and Delivery, an advanced and practical extension of classical routing models. This variant integrates the characteristics of the Steiner Traveling Salesman Problem with time-window constraints, pickup and delivery operations and vehicle capacity limitations. These features closely mirror the complexities of contemporary logistics challenges, including last-mile distribution, reverse logistics and on-demand service scenarios. To tackle the inherent computational difficulties of this NP-hard problem, we propose two specialized mathematical formulations: an arc-based model and a node-oriented model, each designed to capture distinct structural aspects of the problem. We further introduce a preprocessing reduction method that eliminates redundant arcs, significantly enhancing computational performance and scalability. Both formulations are implemented using classical and quantum optimization approaches. In particular, the classical models are solved with Gurobi, whereas the quantum implementation is carried out on D-Wave's LeapCQMHybrid platform, a hybrid quantum-classical environment that integrates quantum annealing with classical optimization techniques for constrained problem solving. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed formulations and the preprocessing reduction method. The analyses performed assess the structural properties of the two models, their computational behavior, and the impact of preprocessing on problem size and solution efficiency.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Arbitrary Single-Qubit Rotations on an Embedded Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present a technique for using machine learning (ML) for single-qubit gate synthesis on field programmable logic for a superconducting transmon-based quantum computer based on simulated studies. Our approach is multi-stage. We first bootstrap a model based on simulation with access to the full statevector for measuring gate fidelity. We next present an algorithm, named adapted randomized benchmarking (ARB), for fine-tuning the gate on hardware based on measurements of the devices. We also present techniques for deploying the model on programmable devices with care to reduce the required resources. While the techniques here are applied to a transmon-based computer, many of them are portable to other architectures.</description>
