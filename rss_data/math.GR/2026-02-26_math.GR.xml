      <title>Chirality and Racemization on Isotopy Classes of Loops: A Groupoid-Based Structural Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of chirality and racemization on isotopy classes of finite loops, formulated intrinsically within the loop isotopy groupoid understood in the categorical sense. Motivated by earlier work on quasigroups \cite{InoueQuasiChirality} and by the classical medical paradigm of mirror-related enantiomers, we restrict admissible mirror transitions to those generated by intrinsic, unit-preserving symmetries. Within this framework, racemization is modeled as a two-state dynamics on isotopy classes, with an effective rate determined by the presence of mirror-isotopisms. Our main result shows that this rate vanishes if and only if no loop isotopism exists between a loop and its opposite, providing a structural criterion for chirality. A strengthened variant based on translation-generated symmetries is discussed in the appendix.</description>

      <title>On subgroup growth of iterated wreath products in product action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are hereditarily just infinite groups of any subgroup growth type between $n$ and $n^{\log n}$. This is obtained calculating the subgroup growth type of a family of hereditarily just infinite profinite groups obtained via iterated wreath products of finite permutation groups with respect to product actions.</description>

      <title>On a Cauchy theorem for finite skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22080v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major problems in the structural theory of skew braces consists in the classification of skew braces of finite order up to isomorphism. In this light, the open question of the existence of a Cauchy theorem for finite skew braces is of great interest. We prove a positive answer for the classes of finite two-sided skew braces and bi-skew braces. Consequences and related structural results are also outlined.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Equations over Graph Products and the Exponent of Periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1977, Makanin established the decidability of equations in free monoids. A key ingredient in his proof is the exponent of periodicity: for a word $w$, it is the largest exponent $e$ such that $w$ contains a nonempty factor of the form $p^e$. Makanin showed that if a system of equations in a free monoid has a solution with sufficiently large exponent of periodicity, then it has infinitely many solutions. However, the converse -- whether the existence of infinitely many solutions implies the existence of solutions with arbitrarily large exponent of periodicity -- remains open.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem for quadratic equations in finitely generated groups. Using normal forms to define the exponent of periodicity, we identify structural conditions on groups and their normal forms that guarantee that infinite solution sets of quadratic systems have an unbounded exponent of periodicity. We prove that these conditions are preserved under graph products and, in particular, hold for all finitely generated right-angled Artin groups. In addition, we show that they also hold for finitely generated (graph products of) torsion-free nilpotent and hyperbolic groups, and we characterize the Baumslag-Solitar groups satisfying them.</description>

      <title>Three-Sign Cancellation Hypernumber Systems and Associator Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a three-sign cancellation hypernumber system $H$ which extends the real field by adjoining a third sign $\Lambda$. The underlying set is $H=\{0\}\cup\{+,-,\Lambda\}\times\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, with a single-valued multiplication and a hyperaddition $\boxplus$ designed to encode cancellation phenomena between positive and negative reals. The classical real line embeds as a genuine subfield $\mathbb{R}_{\mathrm{cl}}\subset H$, and all field operations agree with the usual ones on $\mathbb{R}$. The additive structure of $H$ is almost associative but not a canonical hypergroup. We give an explicit description of where associativity fails and compute, for triples of the form $(+,a),(-,b),(\Lambda,c)$, a closed formula for the associativity defect $\kappa(a,b,c)=2\min(a,b)=a+b-|a-b|$, which coincides with the loss of absolute value when adding $a$ and $-b$ in $\mathbb{R}$. To explain this behaviour, we construct an ambient ''cancellation monoid'' $(K,\oplus)$ on $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ which is strictly associative and records both real sums and accumulated cancellation mass. We prove that $H$ cannot be recovered from $K$ by any simple projection, and formulate an ambient reconstruction problem. In addition, scalar multiplication by real numbers (defined via the embedded copy of $\mathbb{R}$) distributes over $\boxplus$, and the sign-layer admits a canonical hypergroup envelope governing the possible signs of hypersums. The results provide a controlled example of a nonassociative hyperaddition sitting over the real field and suggest several directions for multisign generalizations and connections with hyperfields and tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>Strata of Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Weyl group W is a union of strata (certain subsets which are unions of conjugacy classes) which are the nonempty fibres of a map from W to the set of irreducible representations of W. We give an explicit description of strata in terms of a certain modified centralizer group. We also define superstrata of a connected reductive group and state a conjecture about them.</description>

      <title>Structural and rigidity properties of Lie skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate structural and rigidity properties of \emph{Lie skew braces} (LSBs), objects essentially known in the literature as \emph{post--Lie groups}, obtained by endowing a manifold with two compatible group laws that share the same identity element. LSBs extend skew left braces, which are central to the study of non-involutive set-theoretic solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation, to the smooth category. Our first main result shows that, for every connected LSB $(G,\cdot,\circ)$, linearity (in the simply-connected case) and solvability carry over from $(G,\cdot)$ to $(G,\circ)$, whereas the converse direction is rigid: if $(G,\circ)$ is nilpotent (respectively, semisimple) then $(G,\cdot)$ is forced to be solvable (respectively, isomorphic to $(G,\circ)$). Our second results provides two ``flexibility'' statements: every non-linear simply connected Lie group \((G, \cdot )\) admits an LSB \((G,\cdot,\circ)\) such that \((G,\circ)\) is linear, and every simply connected solvable Lie group \((G, \circ )\) supports a LSB \((G,\cdot,\circ)\) such that \((G,\cdot)\) is nilpotent. A third result provides a complete existence table for non-trivial LSBs across the six standard Lie-group classes, abelian, nilpotent (non-abelian), solvable (non-nilpotent), simple, semisimple (non-simple) and mixed type, identifying precisely when a LSB can be built and when only the trivial or no structure occurs. Both the explicit constructions and the properties established in our theorems rely on a factorisation technique for Lie groups, on the correspondence between LSBs and regular subgroups of the affine group $\operatorname{Aff}(G,\cdot)$, which renders LSB theory equivalent to simply transitive affine actions, and on the theory of post-Lie algebras together with their integrability properties.</description>

      <title>Branch iterated Galois groups with positive fixed-point proportion and positive Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we prove that the arithmetic profinite iterated monodromy group of a post-critically infinite unicritical polynomial is regular branch (and so of positive Hausdorff dimension), and has positive fixed-point proportion when the degree is odd. The examples are instances of a bigger family of regular branch groups constructed in this article, whose fixed-point proportion can be computed explicitly and is positive in many cases. This gives the first examples outside the binary rooted tree where a level-transitive group has positive Hausdorff dimension and positive fixed-point proportion, answering in the negative a question of Jones (2008).</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Finding Subgroups of a Given Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a subgroup of a given order in a finite group, where the group is represented by its Cayley table. We analyze the complexity of the problem in the special case of abelian groups and present an optimal algorithm for finding a subgroup of a given order when the input is given in the form of a Cayley table. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has addressed the complexity of this problem under the Cayley table representation.</description>

      <title>Invariant covers of multipartite hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the following ``symmetric analogue'' of Lov\'asz's estimate (1975): if an $r$-partite hypergraph of rank $r\geqslant2$ has a cover of cardinality $n&lt;\infty$, then it admits a cover of cardinality at most $nr/2$, which is invariant with respect to all automorphisms preserving the parts. We obtain also symmetric analogues of generalisations of Lov\'asz's estimate due to Aharoni, Holzman, and Krivelevich (1996).</description>
