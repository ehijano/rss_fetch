      <title>Emergent multifractality in power-law decaying eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstate multifractality is of significant interest with potential applications in various fields of quantum physics. Most of the previous studies concentrated on fine-tuned quantum models to realize multifractality which is generally believed to be a critical phenomenon and fragile to random perturbations. In this work, we propose a set of generic principles based on the power-law decay of the eigenstates which allow us to distinguish a fractal phase from a genuine multifractal phase. We demonstrate the above principles in a 1d tight-binding model with inhomogeneous nearest-neighbor hopping that can be mapped to the standard quantum harmonic oscillator via energy-coordinate duality. We analytically calculate the fractal dimensions and the spectrum of fractal dimensions which are in agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Linear-time classical approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing low-energy configurations (i.e., approximate optimization) of classical spin glasses is of relevance to both condensed matter and combinatorial optimization. Recent theoretical work opens the possibility to make its time complexity with quantum annealing generically polynomial, and D-Wave experiments can now achieve approximate optimization of cubic-lattice classical Ising spin glasses with $\sim$$10^4$ spins. It is therefore timely to ask which short-range classical spin glasses are good candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage in the time complexity of approximate optimization. One intuition is to consider models with very rugged energy landscapes in configuration space, where optimization is extremely slow with state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo methods. However, here we provide evidence that short-range classical spin glasses may be approximately optimized in linear time and space with a very simple deterministic tensor-network heuristic regardless of ruggedness. On the cubic lattice with up to 50$\times$50$\times$50 spins, we obtain energy errors of $\lesssim$3\% for the $\pm J$ model used in recent D-Wave experiments, and $\lesssim$5\% for much harder planted-solution instances, all in less than one hour per instance. For cubic-lattice-Ising reductions of unweighted Max-Cut on random 3-regular graphs with up to 300 vertices, we find energy errors of $&lt;$1\% and approximation ratios of about 72-88\%. These results inform the search for quantum advantage and suggest an efficient classical method for generating warm starts for other spin-glass optimization algorithms. Our algorithm is amenable to massive parallelization and may also allow for low-power, accelerated implementations with photonic matrix-multiplication hardware.</description>

      <title>Bounding multifractality by observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractal dimensions have been used as a quantitative measure for structure of eigenstates of quantum many-body systems, useful for comparison to random matrix theory predictions or to distinguish many-body localized systems from chaotic ones. For chaotic systems at midspectrum the states are expected to be ``ergodic'', infinite temperature states with all fractal dimensions approaching 1 in the thermodynamic limit. However, when moving away from midspectrum, the states develop structure, as they are expected to follow the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, with few-body observables predicted by a finite-temperature ensemble. We discuss how this structure of the observables can be used to bound the fractal dimensions from above, thus explaining their typical arc-shape over the energy spectrum. We then consider how such upper bounds act as a proxy for the fractal dimension over the many-body localization transition, thus formally connecting the single-particle and Fock space pictures discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Observation of Non-Ergodic States in Two-Dimensional Non-Topological Bubble Lattices</title>

Abstract: Disordered 2D lattices, including hexatic and various glassy states, are observed in a wide range of 2D systems including colloidal nanoparticle assemblies and fluxon lattices. Their disordered nature determines the stability and mobility of these systems, as well as their response to the external stimuli. Here we report on the controlled creation and characterization of a disordered 2D lattice of non-topological magnetic bubbles in the non-centrosymmetric ferrimagnetic alloy Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. By analyzing the type and frequency of fundamental lattice defects, such as dislocations, the orientational correlation, as well as the induced motion of the lattice in an external field, a non-ergodic glassy state, stabilized by directional application of an external field, is revealed.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of random matrices with generalised correlations: a path integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.06225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random matrix theory allows one to deduce the eigenvalue spectrum of a large matrix given only statistical information about its elements. Such results provide insight into what factors contribute to the stability of complex dynamical systems. In this letter, we study the eigenvalue spectrum of an ensemble of random matrices with correlations between any pair of elements. To this end, we introduce an analytical method that maps the resolvent of the random matrix onto the response functions of a linear dynamical system. The response functions are then evaluated using a path integral formalism, enabling us to make deductions about the eigenvalue spectrum. Our central result is a simple, closed-form expression for the leading eigenvalue of a large random matrix with generalised correlations. This formula demonstrates that correlations between matrix elements that are not diagonally opposite, which are often neglected, can have a significant impact on stability.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of random-matrix universality in persistent Lotka-Volterra communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of a random matrix often only depends on the first and second moments of its elements, but not on the specific distribution from which they are drawn. The validity of this universality principle is often assumed without proof in applications. In this Letter, we offer a pertinent counterexample in the context of the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations. Using dynamic mean-field theory, we derive the statistics of the interactions between species in an evolved ecological community. We then show that the full statistics of these interactions, beyond those of a Gaussian ensemble, are required to correctly predict the eigenvalue spectrum and therefore stability. Consequently, the universality principle fails in this system. We thus show that the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices can be used to deduce the stability of ``feasible'' ecological communities, but only if the emergent non-Gaussian statistics of the interactions between species are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Temporal Contrastive Learning through implicit non-equilibrium memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The backpropagation method has enabled transformative uses of neural networks. Alternatively, for energy-based models, local learning methods involving only nearby neurons offer benefits in terms of decentralized training, and allow for the possibility of learning in computationally-constrained substrates. One class of local learning methods constrasts the desired, clamped behavior with spontaneous, free behavior. However, directly contrasting free and clamped behaviors requires explicit memory. Here, we introduce `Temporal Contrastive Learning', an approach that uses integral feedback in each learning degree of freedom to provide a simple form of implicit non-equilibrium memory. During training, free and clamped behaviors are shown in a sawtooth-like protocol over time. When combined with integral feedback dynamics, these alternating temporal protocols generate an implicit memory necessary for comparing free and clamped behaviors, broadening the range of physical and biological systems capable of contrastive learning. Finally, we show that non-equilibrium dissipation improves learning quality and determine a Landauer-like energy cost of contrastive learning through physical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nature of temperature chaos in spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperature chaos (TC) in spin glasses has been claimed to exist no matter how small the temperature change, $\Delta T$. However, experimental studies have exhibited a finite value of $\Delta T$ for a transition to TC. This paper explores the onset of TC with much higher resolution than before and over a larger temperature range. We find that TC is always present, though small at the smallest $\Delta T$ that we can reliably measure. However, it grows rapidly as $\Delta T$ increases, the region of rapid growth coinciding with the $\Delta T$ predicted from renormalization group arguments and observed experimentally. We are able to transcend the full range of TC, from the completely reversible state to one that is maximally decorrelated from the initially prepared state.</description>

      <title>Fate of pseudo mobility-edge and multiple states in non-Hermitian Wannier-Stark lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between non-reciprocity and disorder-free localization has emerged as a fascinating open question. Here, we explore the effects of pseudo mobility edges (MEs) along with different types of eigenstates in a one-dimensional (1D) lattice subjected to a non-reciprocal finite-height Wannier-Stark ladder. Utilizing the transfer matrix method, we analytically investigate the pseudo mobility edges under non-reciprocity, which accurately describe the boundary between ergodic and non-ergodic states. The ergodic states, under nonreciprocity, form topological point gaps in the complex plane, with the corresponding eigenstates localized at the boundaries. The localization of mixed states induced by the skin effect and Wannier-Stark ladder is further amplified under non-reciprocity. Through similarity transformations, the fate of multiple eigenstates under non-reciprocal transitions can be captured. Finally, we use wave packet dynamics as a means to detect these emerging states. Our findings broaden the understanding of disorder-free localization in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Dispersal-induced instability in complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.04206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In his seminal work in the 1970s, Robert May suggested that there is an upper limit to the number of species that can be sustained in stable equilibrium by an ecosystem. This deduction was at odds with both intuition and the observed complexity of many natural ecosystems. The so-called stability-diversity debate ensued, and the discussion about the factors contributing to ecosystem stability or instability continues to this day. We show in this work that dispersal can be a destabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work on pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach. We demonstrate how a stable equilibrium in a complex ecosystem with trophic structure can become unstable with the introduction of dispersal in space, and we discuss the factors which contribute to this effect. Our work highlights that adding more details to the model of May can give rise to more ways for an ecosystem to become unstable. Making May's simple model more realistic is therefore unlikely to entirely remove the upper bound on complexity.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Heatbath Algorithm in LFT using Generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Heatbath Algorithm is commonly used for sampling in local lattice field theories, but performing exact updates or sampling from the local density is challenging when dealing with continuous variables. Heatbath methods rely on rejection-based sampling at each site, which can suffer from low acceptance rates if the proposal distribution is not optimally chosen a nontrivial task. In this work, we propose a novel, straightforward approach for generating proposals at each lattice site for the phi4 and XY models using generative AI models. This method learns a conditional local distribution, without requiring training samples from the target, conditioned on both neighboring sites and action parameter values.</description>

      <title>Practical Few-Atom Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) harnesses quantum systems to tackle intricate computational problems with exceptional efficiency and minimized energy usage. This paper presents a QRC framework that utilizes a minimalistic quantum reservoir, consisting of only a few two-level atoms within an optical cavity. The system is inherently scalable, as newly added atoms automatically couple with the existing ones through the shared cavity field. We demonstrate that the quantum reservoir outperforms traditional classical reservoir computing in both memory retention and nonlinear data processing through two tasks, namely the prediction of time-series data using the Mackey-Glass task and the classification of sine-square waveforms. Our results show significant performance improvements with an increasing number of atoms, facilitated by non-destructive, continuous quantum measurements and polynomial regression techniques. These findings confirm the potential of QRC as a practical and efficient solution to addressing complex computational challenges in quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>
