      <title>Report on the Advanced Linear Collider Study Group (ALEGRO) Workshop 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The workshop focused on the application of ANAs to particle physics keeping in mind the ultimate goal of a collider at the energy frontier (10\,TeV, e$^+$/e$^-$, e$^-$/e$^-$, or $\gamma\gamma$). The development of ANAs is conducted at universities and national laboratories worldwide. The community is thematically broad and diverse, in particular since lasers suitable for ANA research (multi-hundred-terawatt peak power, a few tens of femtosecond-long pulses) and acceleration of electrons to hundreds of mega electron volts to multi giga electron volts became commercially available. The community spans several continents (Europe, America, Asia), including more than 62 laboratories in more than 20 countries. It is among the missions of the ICFA-ANA panel to feature the amazing progress made with ANAs, to provide international coordination and to foster international collaborations towards a future HEP collider. The scope of this edition of the workshop was to discuss the recent progress and necessary steps towards realizing a linear collider for particle physics based on novel-accelerator technologies (laser or beam driven in plasma or structures). Updates on the relevant aspects of the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) Roadmap Process as well as of the P5 (in the US) were presented, and ample time was dedicated to discussions. The major outcome of the workshop is the decision for ALEGRO to coordinate efforts in Europe, in the US, and in Asia towards a pre-CDR for an ANA-based, 10\,TeV CM collider. This goal of this coordination is to lead to a funding proposal to be submitted to both EU and EU/US funding agencies. This document presents a summary of the workshop, as seen by the co-chairs, as well as short 'one-pagers' written by the presenters at the workshop.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Test of Compact, Distributed-Charge, X-Band Accelerator Systems that Enable Image-Guided, VHEE FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10 {\mu}A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical" footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual micro-bunches per RF pulse enables &gt; 10 nC of charge to be produced in a macrobunch of &lt; 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.</description>

      <title>Determination of lattice functions and 2nd-order transfer matrix for High Power Cyclotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.01397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes the development of beam dynamic simulation code for cyclotron. Starting from a description of beam dynamics in the cyclotron, lattice functions were determined and the solutions for the 2nd-order nonlinear Hamiltonian were revised. Based on the description of beam dynamics in the cyclotron, simulation code was also developed for cyclotron design.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle accelerators generate charged-particle beams with tailored distributions in six-dimensional position-momentum space (phase space). Knowledge of the phase space distribution enables model-based beam optimization and control. In the absence of direct measurements, the distribution must be tomographically reconstructed from its projections. In this paper, we highlight that such problems can be severely underdetermined and that entropy maximization is the most conservative solution strategy. We leverage normalizing flows -- invertible generative models -- to extend maximum-entropy tomography to six-dimensional phase space and perform numerical experiments to validate the model's performance. Our numerical experiments demonstrate consistency with exact two-dimensional maximum-entropy solutions and the ability to fit complicated six-dimensional distributions to large measurement sets in reasonable time.</description>
