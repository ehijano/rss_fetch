      <title>A note on spectral properties of random $S$-adic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with random $S$-adic systems arising from an i.i.d.\ sequence of unimodular substitutions. Using equidistribution results of Benoist and Quint, we show in Theorem 3.3 that, under some natural assumptions, if the Lyapunov exponent of the spectral cocycle is strictly less that 1/2 of the Lyapunov exponent of the random walk on $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ driven by the sequence of substitution matrices, then almost surely the spectrum of the $S$-adic $\mathbb{Z}$-action is singular with respect to any (fixed in advance) continuous measure.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Reducibility of $C^k$ Quasi-Periodic Cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2022] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture in positive characteristic holds for bounded-degree self-maps of projective varieties. The key ingredient of the proof is a Mordell-Lang-type result for arbitrary algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic, which is also interesting on its own. Moreover, we propose a geometric version of dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Decay of Correlations via induced Weak Gibbs Markov maps for non-H\"{o}lder observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the results of [Ullah, A., Vilarinho, H,.: Statistical properties of dynamical systems via induced weak Gibbs Markov maps. arXiv:2311.17531 (2023)] by considering larger classes of observables. More precisely, we obtain estimates on the decay of correlations, Central Limit Theorem and Large Deviations for dynamical systems having an induced weak Gibbs Markov map, for larger classes of observables with weaker regularity than H\"{o}lder.</description>

      <title>Memoryless concretization relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of memoryless concretization relation (MCR) to describe abstraction within the context of controller synthesis. This relation is a specific instance of alternating simulation relation (ASR), where it is possible to simplify the controller architecture. In the case of ASR, the concretized controller needs to simulate the concurrent evolution of two systems, the original and abstract systems, while for MCR, the designed controllers only need knowledge of the current concrete state. We demonstrate that the distinction between ASR and MCR becomes significant only when a non-deterministic quantizer is involved, such as in cases where the state space discretization consists of overlapping cells. We also show that any abstraction of a system that alternatingly simulates a system can be completed to satisfy MCR at the expense of increasing the non-determinism in the abstraction. We clarify the difference between the MCR and the feedback refinement relation (FRR), showing in particular that the former allows for non-constant controllers within cells. This provides greater flexibility in constructing a practical abstraction, for instance, by reducing non-determinism in the abstraction. Finally, we prove that this relation is not only sufficient, but also necessary, for ensuring the above properties.</description>

Abstract: A cellular automaton (CA)-based modeling approach to simulate wildfire spread, emphasizing its strengths in capturing complex fire dynamics and its integration with geographic information systems (GIS).
  The model introduces an enhanced CA-based methodology for wildfire prediction, emphasizing interactions between neighboring cells and incorporating major determinants of fire spread, including wind direction, wind speed, and vegetation density, while also accounting for spotting and probabilistic transitions between states in the model to mirror real-world fire behavior.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory model order reduction of large-scale dynamical systems with root mean squared error measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The root mean squared error is an important measure used in a variety of applications such as structural dynamics and acoustics to model averaged deviations from standard behavior. For large-scale systems, simulations of this quantity quickly become computationally prohibitive. Classical model order reduction techniques attempt to resolve this issue via the construction of surrogate models that emulate the root mean squared error measure using an intermediate linear system. However, this approach requires a potentially large number of linear outputs, which can be disadvantageous in the design of reduced-order models. In this work, we consider directly the root mean squared error as the quantity of interest using the concept of quadratic-output models and propose several new model reduction techniques for the construction of appropriate surrogates. We test the proposed methods on a model for the vibrational response of a plate with tuned vibration absorbers.</description>

      <title>Local first integrals for stochastic differential equations</title>

Abstract: Poincar\'{e}'s classical results [H. Poincar\'{e}, Sur l'int\'{e}gration des \'{e}quations diff\'{e}rentielles du premier order et du premier degr\'{e} I and II, Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 5 (1891) 161-191; 11 (1897) 193-239] first provide a link between the existence of analytic first integrals and the resonant relations for analytic dynamical systems. In this paper, we show that by appropriately selecting the definition of the stochastic local first integrals, we are able to obtain the stochastic version of Poincar\'e non-integrability theorem. More specifically, we introduce two definitions of local first integrals for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the sense of probability one and expectation, respectively. We present the necessary conditions for the existence of functionally independent analytic or rational first integrals of SDEs via the resonances. We also show that for given integrable ordinary differential equations with some nondegeneracy conditions, there exists a linear stochastic perturbation such that the corresponding disturbed SDEs have no any analytic first integrals. Some examples are given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>SINDy-RL: Interpretable and Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown significant promise for uncovering sophisticated control policies that interact in environments with complicated dynamics, such as stabilizing the magnetohydrodynamics of a tokamak fusion reactor or minimizing the drag force exerted on an object in a fluid flow. However, these algorithms require an abundance of training examples and may become prohibitively expensive for many applications. In addition, the reliance on deep neural networks often results in an uninterpretable, black-box policy that may be too computationally expensive to use with certain embedded systems. Recent advances in sparse dictionary learning, such as the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), have shown promise for creating efficient and interpretable data-driven models in the low-data regime. In this work we introduce SINDy-RL, a unifying framework for combining SINDy and DRL to create efficient, interpretable, and trustworthy representations of the dynamics model, reward function, and control policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches on benchmark control environments and challenging fluids problems. SINDy-RL achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DRL algorithms using significantly fewer interactions in the environment and results in an interpretable control policy orders of magnitude smaller than a deep neural network policy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a continuous opinion and discrete action dynamics model coupled with an external observation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a set of consumers in a city or town (who thus generate pollution) whose opinion is governed by a continuous opinion and discrete action (CODA) dynamics model. This dynamics is coupled with an observation signal dynamics, which defines the information the consumers have access to regarding the common pollution. We show that the external observation signal has a significant impact on the asymptotic behavior of the CODA model. When the coupling is strong, it induces either a chaotic behavior or convergence towards a limit cycle. When the coupling is weak, a more classical behavior characterized by local agreements in polarized clusters is observed. In both cases, conditions under which clusters of consumers don't change their actions are provided.Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the derived analytical results.</description>

      <title>On using Machine Learning Algorithms for Motorcycle Collision Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally, motorcycles attract vast and varied users. However, since the rate of severe injury and fatality in motorcycle accidents far exceeds passenger car accidents, efforts have been directed toward increasing passive safety systems. Impact simulations show that the risk of severe injury or death in the event of a motorcycle-to-car impact can be greatly reduced if the motorcycle is equipped with passive safety measures such as airbags and seat belts. For the passive safety systems to be activated, a collision must be detected within milliseconds for a wide variety of impact configurations, but under no circumstances may it be falsely triggered. For the challenge of reliably detecting impending collisions, this paper presents an investigation towards the applicability of machine learning algorithms. First, a series of simulations of accidents and driving operation is introduced to collect data to train machine learning classification models. Their performance is henceforth assessed and compared via multiple representative and application-oriented criteria.</description>

      <title>Trust AI Regulation? Discerning users are vital to build trust and effective AI regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is general agreement that some form of regulation is necessary both for AI creators to be incentivised to develop trustworthy systems, and for users to actually trust those systems. But there is much debate about what form these regulations should take and how they should be implemented. Most work in this area has been qualitative, and has not been able to make formal predictions. Here, we propose that evolutionary game theory can be used to quantitatively model the dilemmas faced by users, AI creators, and regulators, and provide insights into the possible effects of different regulatory regimes. We show that creating trustworthy AI and user trust requires regulators to be incentivised to regulate effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of two mechanisms that can achieve this. The first is where governments can recognise and reward regulators that do a good job. In that case, if the AI system is not too risky for users then some level of trustworthy development and user trust evolves. We then consider an alternative solution, where users can condition their trust decision on the effectiveness of the regulators. This leads to effective regulation, and consequently the development of trustworthy AI and user trust, provided that the cost of implementing regulations is not too high. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the effect of different regulatory regimes from an evolutionary game theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>A characterisation of linear repetitivity for cut and project sets with general polytopal windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cut and project method is a central construction in the theory of Aperiodic Order for generating quasicrystals with pure point diffraction. Linear repetitivity ({\bf LR}) is a form of ideal regularity of aperiodic patterns. Recently, Koivusalo and the present author characterised {\bf LR} for cut and project sets with convex polytopal windows whose supporting hyperplanes are commensurate with the lattice, the weak homogeneity property. For such cut and project sets, we show that {\bf LR} is equivalent to two properties. One is a low complexity condition, which may be determined from the cut and project data by calculating the ranks of the intersections of the projection of the lattice to the internal space with the subspaces parallel to the supporting hyperplanes of the window. The second condition is that the projection of the lattice to the internal space is Diophantine (or `badly approximable'), which loosely speaking means that the lattice points in the total space stay far from the physical space, relative to their norm. We review then extend these results to non-convex and disconnected polytopal windows, as well as windows with polytopal partitions producing cut and project sets of labelled points. Moreover, we obtain a complete characterisation of {\bf LR} in the fully general case, where weak homogeneity is not assumed. Here, the Diophantine property must be replaced with an inhomogeneous analogue. We show that cut and project schemes with internal space isomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^n \oplus G \oplus \mathbb{Z}^r\), for \(G\) finite Abelian, can, up to MLD equivalence, be reduced to ones with internal space \(\mathbb{R}^n\), so our results also cover cut and project sets of this form, such as the (generalised) Penrose tilings.</description>

      <title>Koopman operators with intrinsic observables in rigged reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and its spectra. We propose an estimation method, what we call Jet Dynamic Mode Decomposition (JetDMD), leveraging the intrinsic structure of RKHS and the geometric notion known as jets to enhance the estimation of the Koopman operator. This method refines the traditional Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) in accuracy, especially in the numerical estimation of eigenvalues. This paper proves JetDMD's superiority through explicit error bounds and convergence rate for special positive definite kernels, offering a solid theoretical foundation for its performance. We also delve into the spectral analysis of the Koopman operator, proposing the notion of extended Koopman operator within a framework of rigged Hilbert space. This notion leads to a deeper understanding of estimated Koopman eigenfunctions and capturing them outside the original function space. Through the theory of rigged Hilbert space, our study provides a principled methodology to analyze the estimated spectrum and eigenfunctions of Koopman operators, and enables eigendecomposition within a rigged RKHS. We also propose a new effective method for reconstructing the dynamical system from temporally-sampled trajectory data of the dynamical system with solid theoretical guarantee. We conduct several numerical simulations using the van der Pol oscillator, the Duffing oscillator, the H\'enon map, and the Lorenz attractor, and illustrate the performance of JetDMD with clear numerical computations of eigenvalues and accurate predictions of the dynamical systems.</description>
