      <title>On quantum models for opinion and voting intention polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we construct a connection between two quantum voting models presented previously. We propose to try to determine the result of a vote from associated given opinion polls. We introduce a density operator relative to the family of all candidates to a particular election. From an hypothesis of proportionality between a family of coefficients which characterize the density matrix and the probabilities of vote for all the candidates, we propose a numerical method for the entire determination of the density operator. This approach is a direct consequence of the Perron-Frobenius theorem for irreductible positive matrices. We applyour algorithm to synthetic data and to operational results issued from the French presidential election of April 2012.</description>

      <title>100 years of plastic -- using the past to guide the future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust and credible material flow data are required to support the ongoing efforts to reconcile the economic and social benefits of plastics with their human and environmental health impacts. This study presents a global, but regionalized, life cycle material flow analysis (MFA) of all plastic polymers and applications for the period 1950-2020. It also illustrates how this dataset can be used to generate possible scenarios for the next 30 years. The historical account documents how the relentless growth of plastic production and use has consistently outpaced waste management systems worldwide and currently generates on the order of 60 Mt of mismanaged plastic waste annually. The scenarios show that robust interventions are needed to avoid annual plastic waste mismanagement from doubling by 2050.</description>

      <title>Spatial prisoner's dilemma optimally played in small-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is commonly found in ecological and social systems even when it apparently seems that individuals can benefit from selfish behavior. We investigate how cooperation emerges with the spatial prisoner's dilemma played in a class of networks ranging from regular lattices to random networks. We find that, among these networks, small-world topology is the optimal structure when we take into account the speed at which cooperative behavior propagates. Our results may explain why the small-world properties are self-organized in real networks.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Opinion Formation of Emotional Eccitable Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bounded confidence model represents a widely adopted framework for modeling opinion dynamics wherein actors have a continuous-valued opinion and interact and approach their positions in the opinion space only if their opinions are within a specified confidence threshold. Here, we propose a novel framework where the confidence bound is determined by a decreasing function of their emotional arousal, an additional independent variable distinct from the opinion value. Additionally, our framework accounts for agents' ability to broadcast messages, with interactions influencing the timing of each other's message emissions. Our findings underscore the significant role of synchronization in shaping consensus formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that variable confidence intervals alter the impact of step length when navigating the opinion space, leading to deviations from observations in the traditional Deffuant model.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Urban Morphogenesis: A Morphospace Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities emerged independently across different world regions and historical periods, raising fundamental questions: How did the first urban settlements develop? What social and spatial conditions enabled their emergence? Are these processes universal or context-dependent? Moreover, what distinguishes cities from other human settlements? This paper investigates the drivers of city creation through a hybrid approach that integrates urban theory with the biological concept of morphospace (the space of all possible configurations) and archaeological evidence. It examines the transition from sedentary hunter-gatherer communities to urban societies, identifying key forces such as defence, social hierarchy formation, population scale, and work specialization, culminating in increasingly complex divisions of labour as a central driver of urbanization. Morphogenesis is conceptualised as a trajectory across morphospace, shaped by structure-seeking selection processes that balance density, permeability, and information as critical dimensions. The study highlights the non-ergodic nature of urban morphogenesis, where configurations are progressively selected based on their fitness to support the diversifying interactions between mutually dependent agents. The morphospace framework effectively distinguishes between theoretical spatial configurations, non-urban and proto-urban settlements, and contemporary cities. This analysis supports the proposition that cities emerge and evolve as solutions balancing density, permeability, and informational organization, enabling them to support increasingly complex societal functions.</description>

      <title>A Parrondo paradox in susceptible-infectious-susceptible dynamics over periodic temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many social and biological networks periodically change over time with daily, weekly, and other cycles. Thus motivated, we formulate and analyze susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic models over temporal networks with periodic schedules. More specifically, we assume that the temporal network consists of a cycle of alternately used static networks, each with a given duration. We observe a phenomenon in which two static networks are individually above the epidemic threshold but the alternating network composed of them renders the dynamics below the epidemic threshold, which we refer to as a Parrondo paradox for epidemics. We find that network structure plays an important role in shaping this phenomenon, and we study its dependence on the connectivity between and number of subpopulations in the network. We associate such paradoxical behavior with anti-phase oscillatory dynamics of the number of infectious individuals in different subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Content Aware Analysis of Scholarly Networks: A Case Study on CORD19 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationships among key elements of the scientific research network, namely articles, researchers, and journals. We introduce a novel approach to use semantic information through the HITS algorithm-based propagation of topic information in the network. The topic information is derived by using the Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linkage. In our case, MedCAT is used to extract the topics from the CORD19 Dataset, which is a corpus of academic articles about COVID-19 and the coronavirus scientific network. Our approach focuses on the COVID-19 domain, utilizing the CORD-19 dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of integrating topic-related information within the citation framework. Through the application of a hybrid HITS algorithm, we show that incorporating topic data significantly influences article rankings, revealing deeper insights into the structure of the academic community.</description>
