      <title>Ordinal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinal data analysis is an interesting direction in machine learning. It mainly deals with data for which only the relationships `$&lt;$', `$=$', `$&gt;$' between pairs of points are known. We do an attempt of formalizing structures behind ordinal data analysis by introducing the notion of ordinal spaces on the base of a strict axiomatic approach. For these spaces we study general properties as isomorphism conditions, connections with metric spaces, embeddability in Euclidean spaces, topological properties etc.</description>

      <title>Minimum spanning paths and Hausdorff distance in finite ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a minimum weight spanning tree of a finite ultrametric space can be always found in the form of path. As a canonical representing tree such path uniquely defines the whole space and, moreover, it has much more simple structure. Thus, minimum spanning paths are a convenient tool for studying finite ultrametric spaces. To demonstrate this we use them for characterization of some known classes of ultrametric spaces. The explicit formula for Hausdorff distance in finite ultrametric spaces is also found. Moreover, the possibility of using minimum spanning paths for finding this distance is shown.</description>

      <title>Hereditary properties of finite ultrametric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characterization of finite homogeneous ultrametric spaces and finite ultrametric spaces generated by unrooted labeled trees is found in terms of representing trees. A characterization of finite ultrametric spaces having perfect strictly $n$-ary trees is found in terms of special graphs connected with the space. Further, we give a detailed survey of some special classes of finite ultrametric spaces, which were considered in the last ten years, and study their hereditary properties. More precisely, we are interested in the following question. Let $X$ be an arbitrary finite ultrametric space from some given class. Does every subspace of $X$ also belong to this class?</description>

      <title>Thurston construction mapping classes with minimal dilatation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pair of filling curves $\alpha, \beta$ on a surface of genus $g$ with $n$ punctures, we explicitly compute the mapping classes realizing the minimal dilatation over all the pseudo-Anosov maps given by the Thurston construction on $\alpha,\beta$. We do so by solving for the minimal spectral radius in a congruence subgroup of $\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We apply this result to realized lower bounds on intersection number between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to give the minimal dilatation over any Thurston construction pA map on $\Sigma_{g,n}$ given by a filling pair $\alpha \cup \beta$.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a determinstic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave determinstic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, with partially identical shapes and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the homeomorphism groups of ordinals equipped with their order topology, focusing on successor ordinals whose limit capacity is also a successor. This is a rich family of groups that has connections to both permutation groups and homeomorphism groups of manifolds.
  For ordinals of Cantor--Bendixson degree one, we prove that the homeomorphism group is strongly distorted and uniformly perfect, and we classify its normal generators. As a corollary, we recover and provide a new proof of the classical result that the subgroup of finite permutations in the symmetric group on a countably infinite set is the maximal proper normal subgroup.
  For ordinals of higher Cantor--Bendixson degree, we establish a semi-direct product decomposition of the (pure) homeomorphism group. When the limit capacity is one, we further compute the abelianizations and determine normal generating sets of minimal cardinality for these groups.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Interleaving Distance for Mapper Graphs with a Loss Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15130v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data consisting of a graph with a function mapping into $\mathbb{R}^d$ arise in many data applications, encompassing structures such as Reeb graphs, geometric graphs, and knot embeddings. As such, the ability to compare and cluster such objects is required in a data analysis pipeline, leading to a need for distances between them. In this work, we study the interleaving distance on discretization of these objects, called mapper graphs when $d=1$, where functor representations of the data can be compared by finding pairs of natural transformations between them. However, in many cases, computation of the interleaving distance is NP-hard. For this reason, we take inspiration from recent work by Robinson to find quality measures for families of maps that do not rise to the level of a natural transformation, called assignments. We then endow the functor images with the extra structure of a metric space and define a loss function which measures how far an assignment is from making the required diagrams of an interleaving commute. Finally we show that the computation of the loss function is polynomial with a given assignment. We believe this idea is both powerful and translatable, with the potential to provide approximations and bounds on interleavings in a broad array of contexts.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Without Open Sets: A Net Approach to Homotopy Theory in Limit Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convergence spaces are a generalization of topological spaces. The category of convergence spaces is well-suited for Algebraic Topology, one of the reasons is the existence of exponential objects provided by continuous convergence. In this work, we use a net-theoretic approach to convergence spaces. The goal is to simplify the description of continuous convergence and apply it to problems related to homotopy theory. We present methods to develop the basis of homotopy theory in limit spaces, define the fundamental groupoid, and prove the groupoid version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for limit spaces.</description>
