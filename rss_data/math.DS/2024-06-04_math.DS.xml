      <title>Continuous dependence for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the continuous dependence on initial values and parameters of solutions as well as invariant measures for McKean-Vlasov SDEs under distribution-dependent Lyapunov conditions. In contrast to the classical SDEs, the solutions for McKean-Vlasov SDEs do not converge in probability although the initial values converge in probability, which is due to the mismatch of the distances between measures. Finally, we give some examples to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Shadowing of non-transversal heteroclinic chains in lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with dynamical systems on complex lattices possessing chains of non-transversal heteroclinic connections between several periodic orbits. The systems we consider are inspired by the so-called \emph{toy model systems} (TMS) used to prove the existence of energy transfer from low to high frequencies in the \emph{nonlinear cubic Schr\"odinger equation} (NLS) or generalizations. Using the geometric properties of the complex projective space as a base space, we generate in a natural way collections of such systems containing this type of chains, both in the Hamiltonian and in the non-Hamiltonian setting. On the other hand, we characterize the property of block diagonal dynamics along the heteroclinic connections that allows these chains to be shadowed, a property which in general only holds for transversal heteroclinic connections. Due to the lack of transversality, only finite chains are shadowed, since there is a dropping dimensions mechanism in the evolution of any disk close to them. The main shadowing technical tool used in our work is the notion of covering relations as introduced by one of the authors.</description>

      <title>Modeling the distribution of insulin in pancreas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintenance of adequate physical and functional pancreatic $\beta$-cell mass is critical for the prevention or delay of diabetes mellitus. It is well established that insulin potently activates mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling cascades in cultured $\beta$-cells. Loss of $\beta$-cell insulin receptors is sufficient to induce type 2 diabetes in mice. However, it remains unclear whether the {\em in vitro} effect in human islets and the {\em in vivo} effects in mice can be applied to human physiology. The major obstacle to a complete understanding of the effects of insulin's feedback in human pancreas is the absence of technology to measure the concentrations of insulin inside of pancreas. To contextualize recent {\em in vitro} data, it is essential to know the local concentration and distribution of insulin in pancreas. To this end, we continue to estimate the local insulin concentration within pancreas. In this paper, we investigate the distribution of insulin concentration along the pancreatic vein through a novel mathematical modeling approach using existing physiological data and islet imaging data, in contrast to our previous work focusing on the insulin level within an islet. Our studies suggest that, in response to an increase in glucose, the insulin concentration along the pancreatic vein increases nearly linearly in the fashion of increasing quicker in tail area but slower in head area depending of the initial distribution.</description>

      <title>Smooth orbit equivalence rigidity for dissipative geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a smooth closed orientable surface. A Gaussian thermostat on $M$ can be seen as the geodesic flow of a certain metric connection with torsion. These flows may not preserve any smooth volume form. We prove that if two Gaussian thermostats on $M$ with negative thermostat curvature are related by a smooth orbit equivalence isotopic to the identity, then the two background metrics are conformally equivalent via a smooth diffeomorphism of $M$ isotopic to the identity. We also give a relationship between the thermostat forms themselves. Finally, we prove the same result for Anosov magnetic flows.</description>

      <title>A detailed analysis of the origin of deep-decoupling oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is influenced substantially by the formation of deep water in the North Atlantic. In many ocean models, so-called deep-decoupling oscillations have been found, whose timescale depends on the characteristics of convective vertical mixing processes. Their precise origin and sensitivity to the representation of mixing have remained unclear so far. To study this problem, we revisit a conceptual Welander model for the evolution of temperature and salinity in two vertically stacked boxes for surface and deep water, which interact through diffusion and/or convective adjustment. The model is known to exhibit several types of deep-decoupling oscillations, with phases of weak diffusive mixing interspersed with strong convective mixing, when the switching between them is assumed to be instantaneous. We present a comprehensive study of oscillations in Welander's model with non-instantaneous switching between mixing phases, as described by a smooth switching function. A dynamical systems approach allows us to distinguish four types of oscillations, in terms of their phases of diffusive versus convective mixing, and to identify the regions in the relevant parameter plane where they exist. The characteristic deep-decoupling oscillations still exist for non-instantaneous switching, but they require switching that is considerably faster than needed for sustaining oscillatory behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a gradual freshwater influx can lead to transitions between different vertical mixing oscillations. Notably, the convective mixing phase becomes shorter and even disappears, resulting in long periods of much reduced deep water formation. The results are relevant for the interpretation of ocean-climate variability in models and (proxy) observations.</description>

      <title>Elementary solution to the fair division problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new and relatively elementary approach is proposed for solving the problem of fair division of a continuous resource (measurable space, pie, etc.) between several participants, the selection criteria of which are described by charges (signed measures). The setting of the problem with charges is considered for the first time. The problem comes down to analyzing the properties of the trajectories of a specially constructed dynamical system acting in the space of finite measurable partitions. Exponentially fast convergence to a limit solution is proved for both the case of true measures and the case of charges.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of General Impulsive VS-EIAR Epidemic Models with Application to Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in a VS-EIAR epidemiological model considering vaccinated individuals ${V_i: i=1,\ldots,n}$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}^{*}$. The dynamic of the VS-EIAR model involves several ordinary differential equations that describe the changes in the vaccinated, susceptible, infected, exposed, asymptomatic, and deceased population groups. Our aim is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, infected, and asymptomatic individuals by administering vaccination doses to susceptible individuals and treatment to infected population. To achieve this, we utilize optimal control theory to regulate the dynamic of our considered epidemic model within a terminal optimal time $\tau^{*}$. Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) will be employed to establish the existence of an optimal control time $(v^{*}(t), u^{*}(t))$. We also incorporate an impulsive VS-EIAR epidemic model, with special attention given to immigration or the travel of certain population groups. Finally, we provide a numerical simulation to demonstrate the practical implementation of the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stability of phase diagram for a gradient ODE with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem governed by the gradient ODE $x'=\nabla F(x)$ in $\R^d$ on which we assume that it has a finite number of hyperbolic equilibria whose stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversally. This problem is perturbed by the memory term $x'(t)=\nabla F(x(t))+\varepsilon\int_{-\infty}^t M(t-s)x(s)\, ds$ where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small constant. The key result is that the structure of connections between the equlibria of the unperturbed problem is exactly preserved for a small $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic optimization for continuous functions on non-Markov shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodic optimization aims to describe dynamically invariant probability measures that maximize the integral of a given function. For a wide class of intrinsically ergodic subshifts over a finite alphabet, we show that the space of continuous functions on the shift space splits into two subsets: one is a $G_\delta$ dense set for which all maximizing measures have `relatively small' entropy; the other is contained in the closure of the set of functions having uncountably many, fully supported ergodic measures with `relatively large' entropy. This result considerably generalizes and unifies the results of Morris (2010) and Shinoda (2018), and applies to a wide class of intrinsically ergodic non-Markov symbolic dynamics without Bowen's specification property, including any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map, some coded shifts and multidimensional $\beta$-transformations. Along with these examples of application, we provide an example of an intrinsically ergodic subshift with positive obstruction entropy to specification.</description>

      <title>Snapshot-driven Rational Interpolation of Parametric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven modeling is relevant for many applications in which the model depends on parameters that can potentially vary in both space and time. In this paper, we present a method to obtain a global parametric model based on snapshots of the parameter space. The parameter snapshots are interpolated using the classical univariate Loewner framework and the global bivariate transfer function is extracted using a linear fractional transformation (LFT). Rank bounds for the minimal order of the global realization are also derived. The results are supported by various numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Charactarisation of distal actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$ and an automorphism $T$ of $G$, we consider the action of $T$ on Sub$_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. We study the action of $T$ on Sub$^p_G$, the closure in Sub$_G$ of the set of closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$. We relate the distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of the closed subgroup generated by $T$ in Aut$(G)$ when $T$ acts distally on the maximal central torus and $G$ is not a vector group. We extend these results to the action of subgroups ${\mathcal H}$ of Aut$(G)$ and equate the distal action of any closed subgroup ${\mathcal H}$ on Sub$^p_G$ with that of every element in ${\mathcal H}$. Moreover, we show that a connected Lie group $G$ acts distally on Sub$^p_G$ by conjugation if and only if $G$ is either compact or it is isomorphic to a direct product of a compact group and a vector group. Our results generalise some results proven by Shah and Yadav.</description>

      <title>A behavioural approach to port-controlled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give insight in the structure of port-Hamiltonian systems as control systems in between two closed Hamiltonian systems. Using the language of category theory, we identify systems with their behavioural representation and view a port-control structure with desired structural properties on a given closed system as an extension of this system which itself may be embedded in a "larger" closed system. The latter system describes the nature of the ports (e.g. Hamiltonian, metriplectic etc.). This point of view allows us to describe meaningful port-control structures for a large family of systems, which is illustrated with Hamiltonian and metriplectic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $R$ of integers is a set of Bohr recurrence if every rotation on $\mathbb{T}^d$ returns arbitrarily close to zero under some non-zero multiple of $R$. We show that the set $\{k!\, 2^m3^n\colon k,m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a set of Bohr recurrence. This is a particular case of a more general statement about images of such sets under any integer polynomial with zero constant term. We also show that if $P$ is a real polynomial with at least one non-constant irrational coefficient, then the set $\{P(2^m3^n)\colon m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{T}$, thus providing a joint generalization of two well-known results, one of Furstenberg and one of Weyl.</description>

      <title>Secret sharing on the Poisson-Furstenberg boundary I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Vadim Kaimanovich presented a particular example of a measure on a product of two standard lamplighter groups such that the Poisson boundary of the induced random walk is non-trivial, but the boundary on the marginals is trivial. This was surprising since such behavior is not possible for measures of finite entropy. As we show in this paper, this secret-sharing phenomenon is possible precisely for pairs of amenable groups with non-trivial ICC-factors.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic and Macroscopic Entropy Balance Equations in a Stochastic Dynamics and Its Deterministic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy, its production, and its change in a dynamical system can be understood from either a fully stochastic dynamic description or from a deterministic dynamics exhibiting chaotic behavior. By taking the former approach based on the general diffusion process with diffusion $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x)$ and drift $\bf b(\bf x)$, where $\alpha$ represents the ``size parameter'' of a system, we show that there are two distinctly different entropy balance equations. One reads ${\rm d} S^{(\alpha)}/{\rm d} t = e^{(\alpha)}_p + Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ for all $\alpha$. However, the leading $\alpha$-order, ``extensive'', terms of the entropy production rate $e^{(\alpha)}_p$ and heat exchange rate $Q^{(\alpha)}_{ex}$ are exactly cancelled. Therefore, in the asymptotic limit of $\alpha\to\infty$, there is a second, local ${\rm d} S/{\rm d} t = \nabla\cdot{\bf b}({\bf x}(t))+\left({\bf D}:{\bf \Sigma}^{-1}\right)({\bf x}(t))$ on the order of $O(1)$, where $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf D}(\bf x(t))$ represents the randomness generated in the dynamics usually represented by metric entropy, and $\tfrac{1}{\alpha}{\bf \Sigma}({\bf x}(t))$ is the covariance matrix of the local Gaussian description at ${\bf x}(t)$, which is a solution to the ordinary differential equation $\dot{\bf x}={\bf b}(\bf x)$ at time $t$. This latter equation is akin to the notions of volume-preserving conservative dynamics and entropy production in the deterministic dynamic approach to nonequilibrium thermodynamics {\it \`{a} la} D. Ruelle. As a continuation of [17], mathematical details with sufficient care are given in four Appendices.</description>

      <title>A quantitative dichotomy for Lyapunov exponents of non-dissipative SDEs with an application to electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a quantitative dichotomy for the top Lyapunov exponent of a class of non-dissipative SDEs on a compact manifold in the small noise limit. Specifically, we prove that in this class, either the Lyapunov exponent is zero for all noise strengths, or it is positive for all noise strengths and that the decay of the exponent in the small-noise limit cannot be faster than linear in the noise parameter. As an application, we study the top Lyapunov exponent for the motion of a charged particle in randomly-fluctuating magnetic fields, which also involves an interesting geometric control problem.</description>

      <title>Crossed product splitting of intermediate operator algebras via 2-cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the C*-algebra inclusions $B \subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ arising from inclusions $B \subset A$ of $\Gamma$-C*-algebras. The main result shows that, when $B \subset A$ is C*-irreducible in the sense of R{\o}rdam, and is centrally $\Gamma$-free in the sense of the author, then after tensoring with the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$, all intermediate C*-algebras $B \subset C\subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ enjoy a natural crossed product splitting \[\mathcal{O}_2\otimes C=(\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes D) \rtimes_{{\rm r}, \gamma, \mathfrak{w}} \Lambda\] for $D:= C \cap A$, some $\Lambda&lt;\Gamma$, and a subsystem $(\gamma, \mathfrak{w})$ of a unitary perturbed cocycle action $\Lambda \curvearrowright \mathcal{O}_2\otimes A$. As an application, we give a new Galois's type theorem for the Bisch--Haagerup type inclusions \[A^K \subset A\rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma\] for actions of compact-by-discrete groups $K \rtimes \Gamma$ on simple C*-algebras.
  Due to a K-theoretical obstruction, the operation $\mathcal{O}_2\otimes -$ is necessary to obtain the clean splitting. Also, in general 2-cocycles $\mathfrak{w}$ appearing in the splitting cannot be removed even further tensoring with any unital (cocycle) action. We show them by examples, which further show that $\mathcal{O}_2$ is a minimal possible choice.
  We also establish a von Neumann algebra analogue, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ is replaced by the type I factor $\mathbb{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb{N}))$.</description>

      <title>Multiple-arc optimization of low-thrust earth-moon orbit transfers leveraging implicit costate transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers from a prescribed low Earth orbit to a specified low lunar orbit. The well-established indirect formulation of minimum-time orbit transfers is extended to a multibody dynamical framework, with initial and final orbits around two distinct primaries. To do this, different representations, useful for describing orbit dynamics, are introduced, i.e., modified equinoctial elements (MEE) and Cartesian coordinates (CC). Use of two sets of MEE, relative to either Earth or Moon, allows simple writing of the boundary conditions about the two celestial bodies, but requires the formulation of a multiple-arc trajectory optimization problem, including two legs: (a) geocentric leg and (b) selenocentric leg. In the numerical solution process, the transition between the two MEE representations uses CC, which play the role of convenient intermediate, matching variables. The multiple-arc formulation at hand leads to identifying a set of intermediate necessary conditions for optimality, at the transition between the two legs. This research proves that a closed-form solution to these intermediate conditions exists, leveraging implicit costate transformation. As a result, the parameter set for an indirect algorithm retains the reduced size of the typical set associated with a single-arc optimization problem. The indirect heuristic technique, based on the joint use of the necessary conditions and a heuristic algorithm (i.e., differential evolution in this study) is proposed as the numerical solution method, together with the definition of a layered fitness function, aimed at facilitating convergence. The minimum-time trajectory of interest is sought in a high-fidelity dynamical framework, with the use of planetary ephemeris and the inclusion of the simultaneous gravitational action of Sun, Earth, and Moon, along the entire transfer path.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of unstable blowup in a quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>

Abstract: In the work Cho et al. [Jpn. J. Ind. Appl. Math. 33 (2016): 145-166] the authors conjecture that the quadratic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) $ i u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $ for $ x \in \mathbb{T}$ is globally well-posed for real initial data. While this may be true in a generic sense, we present evidence that this conjecture is false. Moreover we conjecture that the set of real initial data which blows up under the NLS dynamics is the stable manifold of the zero equilibrium for the nonlinear heat equation $ u_t = u_{xx} + u^2 $.</description>

Abstract: A pair $(A,\mathbf{b})$ of a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be $\textit{infinitely badly approximable}$ if \[ \liminf_{\mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{Z}^n, \|\mathbf{q}\|\to\infty} \|\mathbf{q}\|^{\frac{n}{m}}\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{b}\|_{\mathbb{Z}} =\infty, \] where $\|\cdot\|_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the distance from the nearest integer vector. In this article, we introduce a novel concept of singularity for $(A,\mathbf{b})$ and characterize the infinitely badly approximable property by this singular property. As an application, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the infinitely badly approximable set. We also discuss dynamical interpretations on the space of grids in $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$.</description>

      <title>Criteria for extension of commutativity to fractional iterates of holomorphic self-maps in the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a univalent non-elliptic self-map of the unit disc $\mathbb D$ and let $(\psi_{t})$ be a continuous one-parameter semigroup of holomorphic functions in $\mathbb D$ such that $\psi_{1}\neq\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb D}$ commutes with $\varphi$. This assumption does not imply that all elements of the semigroup $(\psi_t)$ commute with $\varphi$. In this paper, we provide a number of sufficient conditions that guarantee that ${\psi_t\circ\varphi=\varphi\circ\psi_t}$ for all ${t&gt;0}$: this holds, for example, if $\varphi$ and $\psi_1$ have a common boundary (regular or irregular) fixed point different from their common Denjoy-Wolff point $\tau$, or when $\psi_1$ has a boundary regular fixed point ${\sigma\neq\tau}$ at which $\varphi$ is isogonal, or when $(\varphi-\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb D})/(\psi_1-\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb D})$ has an unrestricted limit at $\tau$. In addition, we analyze how $\varphi$ behaves in the petals of the semigroup $(\psi_t)$.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>

      <title>Crossing Numbers of Billiard Curves in the Multidimensional Box via Translation Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The billiard table is modeled as an $n$-dimensional box $[0,a_1]\times [0,a_2]\times \ldots \times [0,a_n] \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with each side having real-valued lengths $a_i$ that are pairwise commensurable. A ball is launched from the origin in direction $d=(1,1,\ldots,1)$. The ball is reflected if it hits the boundary of the billiard table. It comes to a halt when reaching a corner. We show that the number of intersections of the billiard curve at any given point on the table is either $0$ or a power of $2$. To prove this, we use algebraic and number theoretic tools to establish a bijection between the number of intersections of the billiard curve and the number of satisfying assignments of a specific constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <title>How to discretize continuous state-action spaces in Q-learning: A symbolic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.</description>

      <title>Sofic approximation sequences and sofic mean dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to strengthen our understanding of sofic mean dimension of two typical classes of sofic group actions. First, we study finite group actions. We prove that sofic mean dimension of any amenable group action does not depend on the choice of sofic approximation sequences. Previously, this result was known only if the acting group is an infinite amenable group. Moreover, we investigate the full shifts, for all sofic groups and all alphabets. We show that sofic mean dimension of any full shift depends purely on its alphabet. Our method is a refinement of the classical technique in relation to the estimates from above and below, respectively, for mean dimension of some typical actions. The key point of our results is that they apply to all compact metrizable spaces without any restriction (in particular, the alphabet concerned in a full shift and the space involved in a finite group action are not required to be finite-dimensional).
  Furthermore, we improve the quantitative knowledge of sofic mean dimension, restricted to finite-dimensional compact metrizable spaces, for those two typical classes of sofic group actions. As a direct consequence of the main ingredient of our proof, we obtain the exact value of sofic mean dimension of all the actions of finite groups on finite-dimensional compact metrizable spaces. Previously, only an upper bound for these actions was given. Besides, we also get the exact value of sofic mean dimension of full shifts when the alphabet is finite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Discrete subgroups with finite Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure in higher rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple real algebraic group and $\Gamma&lt;G$ be its Zariski dense discrete subgroup. We prove that if $\Gamma\backslash G$ admits any finite Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure, then $\Gamma$ is virtually a product of higher rank lattices and discrete subgroups of rank one factors of $G$. This may be viewed as a measure-theoretic analogue of classification of convex cocompact actions by Kleiner-Leeb and Quint, which was conjectured by Corlette in 1994. The key ingredients in our proof are the product structure of leafwise measures and the high entropy method of Einsiedler-Katok-Lindenstrauss. In a companion paper jointly with Edwards and Oh, we use this result to show that the bottom of the $L^2$ spectrum has no atom in any infinite volume quotient of a higher rank simple algebraic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper by Guglielmi and Hairer (SIADS 2015), an analysis in the $\varepsilon\to 0$ limit was proposed of regularized discontinuous ODEs in codimension-2 switching domains; this was obtained by studying a certain 2-dimensional system describing the so-called hidden dynamics. In particular, the existence of a unique limit solution was not proved in all cases, a few of which were labeled as ambiguous, and it was not clear whether or not the ambiguity could be resolved. In this paper, we show that it cannot be resolved in general. A first contribution of this paper is an illustration of the dependence of the limit solution on the form of the switching function. Considering the parameter dependence in the ambiguous class of discontinuous systems, a second contribution is a bifurcation analysis, revealing a range of possible behaviors. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of solutions in the transition from codimension-2 domains to codimension-3 when there is a limit cycle in the hidden dynamics.</description>

Additionally, we demonstrate the dynamic behavior of the zero distribution of the partition function when a sequence of appropriate regions is selected. Through this analysis, it is shown that the density of zeros around temperature $0$ exponentially diminishes at a rate of $\frac{1}{3^n}$, and the pressure function approaches the logarithmic function.</description>

      <title>Real-time hybrid testing using iterative control for periodic oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time hybrid testing is a method in which a substructure of the system is realised experimentally and the rest numerically. The two parts interact in real time to emulate the dynamics of the full system. Such experiments however are often difficult to realise as the actuators and sensors, needed to ensure compatibility and force-equilibrium conditions at the interface, can seriously affect the predicted dynamics of the system and result in stability and fidelity issues. The traditional approach of using feedback control to overcome the additional unwanted dynamics is challenging due to the presence of an outer feedback loop, passing interface displacements or forces to the numerical substructure. We, therefore, advocate for an alternative approach, removing the problematic interface dynamics with an iterative scheme to minimise interface errors, thus, capturing the response of the true assembly. The technique is examined by hybrid testing of a bench-top four-storey building with different interface configurations, where using conventional hybrid measurement techniques is very challenging. A case where the physical part exhibits nonlinear restoring force characteristics is also considered. These tests show that the iterative approach is capable of handling even scenarios which are theoretically infeasible with feedback control.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes an extreme $C^k$ reducibility theorem of quasi-periodic $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ cocycles in the local perturbative region, revealing both the essence of Eliasson [Commun.Math.Phys.1992] and Hou-You [Invent.Math.2012] in respectively the non-resonant and resonant cases. By paralleling further the reducibility process with the almost reducibility, we are able to acquire the least initial regularity as well as the least loss of regularity for the whole KAM iterations. This, in return, makes various spectral applications of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators wide open.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

Abstract: In this article, an iterated function system (IFS) is considered on the real projective line $\mathbb{RP}^1$ so that the attractor is a Cantor-like set. Hausdorff dimension of this attractor is estimated. The existence of a probability measure associated with this IFS on $\mathbb{RP}^1$ is also demonstrated. It is shown that the $n$-th quantization error of order $r$ for the push-forward measure is a constant multiple of the $n$-th quantization error of order $r$ of the original measure. Finally, an upper bound for the $n$-th quantization error of order $2$ for this measure is provided.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid mathematical modeling approach that effectively couples Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), exemplified through the simulation of epidemiological processes. The hybrid model aims to integrate the spatially detailed representation of disease dynamics provided by PDEs with the computational efficiency of ODEs. In the presented epidemiological use-case, this integration allows for the rapid assessment of public health interventions and the potential impact of infectious diseases across large populations. We discuss the theoretical formulation of the hybrid PDE-ODE model, including the governing equations and boundary conditions. The model's capabilities are demonstrated through detailed simulations of disease spread in synthetic environments and real-world scenarios, specifically focusing on the regions of Lombardy, Italy, and Berlin, Germany. Results indicate that the hybrid model achieves a balance between computational speed and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for policymakers in real-time decision-making and scenario analysis in epidemiology and potentially in other fields requiring similar modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Boundary actions by higher-rank lattices: Classification and embedding in low dimensions, local rigidity, smooth factors</title>

Abstract: We study actions by lattices in higher-rank (semi)simple Lie groups on compact manifolds. By classifying certain measures invariant under a related higher-rank abelian action (the diagonal action on the suspension space) we deduce a number of new rigidity results related to standard projective actions (i.e. boundary actions) by such groups.
  Specifically, in low dimensions we show all actions (with infinite image) are conjugate to boundary actions. We also show standard boundary actions (e.g. projective actions on generalized flag varieties) are local rigid and classify all smooth actions that are topological factors of such actions. Finally, for volume-preserving actions in low dimensions (with infinite image) we provide a mechanism to detect the presence of "blow-ups" for the action by studying measures that are $P$-invariant but not $G$-invariant for the suspension action.</description>

      <title>General fractals represented by $\mathcal{F}$-limit sets of compression maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.08634v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a simple and systematic way to represent general (inhomogeneous) fractals that may look different at different scales and places. By using set-valued compression maps, we express these general fractals as $\mathcal{F}$-limit sets, which are represented as sequences of points in a fixed parameterization space $M$. By choosing different types of sequences in $M$, we get various types of fractals: from self-simlilar to non self-similar, and from deterministic to random. The computational complexity of producing a general fractal is independent of the sequence in $M$, and as a result, is the same as that of an iterated function system obtained from a constant sequence. In the metric space setting, we also estimate the Hausdorff dimension of limit sets for collections of sets that do not necessarily satisfy the Moran structure conditions. In particular, we introduce the concept ``uniform covering condition" for the study of the lower bound of the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set, and provide sufficient conditions for this condition. Specific examples (Cantor-like sets, Sierpi\'nski-like Triangles, etc.) with the calculations of their corresponding Hausdorff dimensions are also studied.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Galois groups for quadratic rational functions with colliding critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field, and let $f\in K(z)$ be rational function. The preimages of a point $x_0\in P^1(K)$ under iterates of $f$ have a natural tree structure. As a result, the Galois group of the resulting field extension of $K$ naturally embeds into the automorphism group of this tree. In unpublished work from 2013, Pink described a certain proper subgroup $M_{\ell}$ that this so-called arboreal Galois group $G_{\infty}$ must lie in if $f$ is quadratic and its two critical points collide at the $\ell$-th iteration. After presenting a new description of $M_{\ell}$ and a new proof of Pink's theorem, we state and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for $G_{\infty}$ to be the full group $M_{\ell}$.</description>

      <title>Zeros of random polynomials undergoing the heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the empirical distribution of the complex roots of high-degree random polynomials, when the polynomial undergoes the heat flow. In one prominent example of Weyl polynomials, the limiting zero distribution evolves from the circular law into the elliptic law until it collapses to the Wigner semicircle law, as was recently conjectured for characteristic polynomials of random matrices by Hall and Ho, 2022. Moreover, for a general family of random polynomials with independent coefficients and isotropic limiting distribution of zeros, we determine the zero distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials in terms of its logarithmic potential. Furthermore, we explicitly identify two critical time thresholds, at which singularities develop and at which the limiting distribution collapses to the semicircle law. We completely characterize the limiting root distribution of the heat-evolved polynomials before singularities develop as the push-forward of the initial distribution under a transport map. Finally, we discuss the results from the perspectives of partial differential equations (in particular Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Burgers' equation), optimal transport, and free probability. The theory is accompanied by explicit examples, simulations, and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Set Descriptive Complexity of Solvable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, we introduced and studied a precise class of dynamical systems called solvable systems. These systems present a dynamic ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with solvable right-hand terms and unique evolution. They correspond to a class of systems for which a transfinite method exist to compute the solution. We also presented several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems might describe ordinal Turing computations. In the current article, we study in more depth solvable systems, using tools from descriptive set theory. By establishing a correspondence with the class of well-founded trees, we construct a coanalytic ranking over the set of solvable functions and discuss its relation with other existing rankings for differentiable functions, in particular with the Kechris-Woodin, Denjoy and Zalcwasser ranking. We prove that our ranking is unbounded below the first uncountable ordinal.</description>
