      <title>Single file motion of robot swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results on the single file motion of a group of robots interacting with each other through position sensors. We successfully replicate the fundamental diagram typical of these systems, with a transition from free flow to congested traffic as the density of the system increases. In the latter scenario we also observe the characteristic stop-and-go waves. The unique advantages of this novel system, such as experimental stability and repeatability, allow for extended experimental runs, facilitating a comprehensive statistical analysis of the global dynamics. Above a certain density, we observe a divergence of the average jam duration and the average number of robots involved in it. This discovery enables us to precisely identify another transition: from congested intermittent flow (for intermediate densities) to a totally congested scenario for high densities. Beyond this finding, the present work demonstrates the suitability of robot swarms to model complex behaviors in many particle systems.</description>

      <title>Epidemic modelling requires knowledge of the social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compartmental models of epidemics are widely used to forecast the effects of communicable diseases such as COVID-19 and to guide policy. Although it has long been known that such processes take place on social networks, the assumption of random mixing is usually made, which ignores network structure. However, super-spreading events have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous. The random-mixing assumption would then produce an overestimation of the herd-immunity threshold for given $R_0$; and a (more significant) overestimation of $R_0$ itself. These two errors compound each other, and can lead to forecasts greatly overestimating the number of infections. Moreover, if networks are heterogeneous and change in time, multiple waves of infection can occur, which are not predicted by random mixing. A simple SIR model simulated on both Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and scale-free networks shows that details of the network structure can be more important than the intrinsic transmissibility of a disease. It is therefore crucial to incorporate network information into standard models of epidemics.</description>
