      <title>Scalable Computation of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Energy Functions for Polynomial Drift Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a scalable tensor-based approach to computing controllability and observability-type energy functions for nonlinear dynamical systems with polynomial drift and linear input and output maps. Using Kronecker product polynomial expansions, we convert the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations for the energy functions into a series of algebraic equations for the coefficients of the energy functions. We derive the specific tensor structure that arises from the Kronecker product representation and analyze the computational complexity to efficiently solve these equations. The convergence and scalability of the proposed energy function computation approach is demonstrated on a nonlinear reaction-diffusion model with cubic drift nonlinearity, for which we compute degree 3 energy function approximations in $n=1023$ dimensions and degree 4 energy function approximations in $n=127$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems through Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control design approach for stabilizing nonlinear control systems. Our key observation is that the set of points where the decrease condition of a control Lyapunov function (CLF) is feasible can be regarded as a safe set. By leveraging a nonsmooth version of control barrier functions (CBFs) and a weaker notion of CLF, we develop a control design that forces the system to converge to and remain in the region where the CLF decrease condition is feasible. We characterize the conditions under which our controller asymptotically stabilizes the origin or a small neighborhood around it, even in the cases where it is discontinuous. We illustrate our design in various examples.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Optimization-Based Separation: the Case of Mixed-Integer Rounding Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-Integer Rounding (MIR) cuts are effective at improving the dual bound in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MIP). However, in practice, MIR cuts are separated heuristically rather than using optimization as the latter is prohibitively expensive. We present a hybrid cut generation framework in which we train a Machine Learning (ML) model to inform cut generation for a family of similar instances. Our framework solves a MIP-based separation problem to generate high-quality MIR cuts, then learns to identify useful constraints that led to these effective cuts. At test time, the predictions of the ML model allow us to solve a reduced MIP-based separation problem. We present computational results for this approach on datasets of randomly perturbed MIPLIB2017 instances.</description>

      <title>An inexact golden ratio primal-dual algorithm with linesearch step for a saddle point problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an inexact golden ratio primal-dual algorithm with linesearch step(IP-GRPDAL) for solving the saddle point problems, where two subproblems can be approximately solved by applying the notations of inexact extended proximal operators with matrix norm. Our proposed IP-GRPDAL method allows for larger stepsizes by replacing the extrapolation step with a convex combination step. Each iteration of the linesearch requires to update only the dual variable, and hence it is quite cheap. In addition, we prove convergence of the proposed algorithm and show an O(1/N) ergodic convergence rate for our algorithm, where N represents the number of iterations. When one of the component functions is strongly convex, the accelerated O(1/N2) convergence rate results are established by choosing adaptively some algorithmic parameters. Furthermore, when both component functions are strongy convex, the linear convergence rate results are achieved. Numerical simulation results on the sparse recovery and image deblurring problems illustrate the feasibility and efficiency of our inexact algorithms.</description>

      <title>A robust stochastic control problem with applications to monotone mean-variance problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a robust stochastic control problem with a monotone mean-variance cost functional and random coefficients. The main technique is to find the saddle point through two backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with unbounded coefficients. We further show that the robust stochastic control problem shares the same optimal control and optimal value with the stochastic control problem with a mean-variance cost functional. The results obtained are then applied to monotone mean-variance and mean-variance portfolio selection problems and monotone mean-variance and mean-variance investment-reinsurance problems.</description>

      <title>The Blessing of Strategic Customers in Personalized Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a feature-based personalized pricing problem in which the buyer is strategic: given the seller's pricing policy, the buyer can augment the features that they reveal to the seller to obtain a low price for the product. We model the seller's pricing problem as a stochastic program over an infinite-dimensional space of pricing policies where the radii by which the buyer can perturb the features are strictly positive. We establish that the sample average approximation of this problem is asymptotically consistent; that is, we prove that the objective value of the sample average approximation converges almost surely to the objective value of the stochastic problem as the number of samples tends to infinity under mild technical assumptions. This consistency guarantee thus shows that incorporating strategic consumer behavior into a data-driven pricing problem can, in addition to making the pricing problem more realistic, also help prevent overfitting.</description>

      <title>A lifted Bregman strategy for training unfolded proximal neural network Gaussian denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unfolded proximal neural networks (PNNs) form a family of methods that combines deep learning and proximal optimization approaches. They consist in designing a neural network for a specific task by unrolling a proximal algorithm for a fixed number of iterations, where linearities can be learned from prior training procedure. PNNs have shown to be more robust than traditional deep learning approaches while reaching at least as good performances, in particular in computational imaging. However, training PNNs still depends on the efficiency of available training algorithms. In this work, we propose a lifted training formulation based on Bregman distances for unfolded PNNs. Leveraging the deterministic mini-batch block-coordinate forward-backward method, we design a bespoke computational strategy beyond traditional back-propagation methods for solving the resulting learning problem efficiently. We assess the behaviour of the proposed training approach for PNNs through numerical simulations on image denoising, considering a denoising PNN whose structure is based on dual proximal-gradient iterations.</description>

      <title>Systemic values-at-risk and their sample-average approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of sample-average approximations (SAA) for set-valued systemic risk measures. We assume that the systemic risk measure is defined using a general aggregation function with some continuity properties and value-at-risk applied as a monetary risk measure. We focus on the theoretical convergence of its SAA under Wijsman and Hausdorff topologies for closed sets. After building the general theory, we provide an in-depth study of an important special case where the aggregation function is defined based on the Eisenberg-Noe network model. In this case, we provide mixed-integer programming formulations for calculating the SAA sets via their weighted-sum and norm-minimizing scalarizations. To demonstrate the applicability of our findings, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis by generating a financial network based on the preferential attachment model and modeling the economic disruptions via a Pareto distribution.</description>

      <title>String Diagram of Optimal Transports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical framework of optimal transports (OTs), namely string diagrams of OTs. Our target problem is a safety problem on string diagrams of OTs, which requires proving or disproving that the minimum transportation cost in a given string diagram of OTs is above a given threshold. We reduce the safety problem on a string diagram of OTs to that on a monolithic OT by composing cost matrices. Our novel reduction exploits an algebraic structure of cost matrices equipped with two compositions: a sequential composition and a parallel composition. We provide a novel algorithm for the safety problem on string diagrams of OTs by our reduction, and we demonstrate its efficiency and performance advantage through experiments.</description>

      <title>RPLUW/M: Enabling RPL on the Internet of Underwater Things</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread use of the Internet of Things, underwater control and monitoring systems for purposes such as ocean data sampling, natural disaster prevention, underwater surveillance, submarine exploration, and the like have become a popular and challenging topic in computers. So far, various topology control and routing solutions have been proposed for these networks. However, as technology expands and applications grow, so does the need for a stable underwater communication platform. On the other hand, underwater communication is associated with challenges such as node mobility, long propagation delays, low bandwidth, limited resources, and high error rates. In this research, for the first time, a topology control platform based on the RPL tree is modelled by applying its structural changes underwater. The proposed RPLUW methods in the case of RPLUWM fixed nodes are introduced to support the mobility of nodes underwater. Flexible objective functions, utilisation of decision-making systems, and application of control schedules in these methods have increased network life, reduced overhead, and increased node efficiency. The simulation results of the proposed method, in comparison with recent methods in this field, show an increase in network efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization has become a standard paradigm for solving large-scale decision-making problems and training large machine learning models without centralizing data. However, this paradigm introduces new privacy and security risks, with malicious agents potentially able to infer private data or impair the model accuracy. Over the past decade, significant advancements have been made in developing secure decentralized optimization and learning frameworks and algorithms. This survey provides a comprehensive tutorial on these advancements. We begin with the fundamentals of decentralized optimization and learning, highlighting centralized aggregation and distributed consensus as key modules exposed to security risks in federated and distributed optimization, respectively. Next, we focus on privacy-preserving algorithms, detailing three cryptographic tools and their integration into decentralized optimization and learning systems. Additionally, we examine resilient algorithms, exploring the design and analysis of resilient aggregation and consensus protocols that support these systems. We conclude the survey by discussing current trends and potential future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supply optimization is a complex and challenging task in the magazine retail industry because of the fixed inventory assumption, irregular sales patterns, and varying product and point-of-sale characteristics. We introduce AthenIA, an industrialized magazine supply optimization solution that plans the supply for over 20,000 points of sale in France. We modularize the supply planning process into a four-step pipeline: demand sensing, optimization, business rules, and operating. The core of the solution is a novel group conformalized quantile regression method that integrates domain expert insights, coupled with a supply optimization technique that balances the costs of out-of-stock against the costs of over-supply. AthenIA has proven to be a valuable tool for magazine publishers, particularly in the context of evolving economic and ecological challenges.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman Methods: A Mean Field Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.11371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman methods are widely used for state estimation in the geophysical sciences. Their success stems from the fact that they take an underlying (possibly noisy) dynamical system as a black box to provide a systematic, derivative-free methodology for incorporating noisy, partial and possibly indirect observations to update estimates of the state; furthermore the ensemble approach allows for sensitivities and uncertainties to be calculated. The methodology was introduced in 1994 in the context of ocean state estimation. Soon thereafter it was adopted by the numerical weather prediction community and is now a key component of the best weather prediction systems worldwide. Furthermore the methodology is starting to be widely adopted for numerous problems in the geophysical sciences and is being developed as the basis for general purpose derivative-free inversion methods that show great promise. Despite this empirical success, analysis of the accuracy of ensemble Kalman methods, in terms of their capabilities as both state estimators and quantifiers of uncertainty, is lagging. The purpose of this paper is to provide a unifying mean field based framework for the derivation and analysis of ensemble Kalman methods. Both state estimation and parameter estimation problems (inverse problems) are considered, and formulations in both discrete and continuous time are employed. For state estimation problems, both the control and filtering approaches are considered; analogously for parameter estimation problems, the optimization and Bayesian perspectives are both studied. The mean field perspective provides an elegant framework, suitable for analysis; furthermore, a variety of methods used in practice can be derived from mean field systems by using interacting particle system approximations. The approach taken also unifies a wide-ranging literature in the field and suggests open problems.</description>

      <title>Relative-Interior Solution for the (Incomplete) Linear Assignment Problem with Applications to the Quadratic Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the set of optimal solutions of the dual linear programming formulation of the linear assignment problem (LAP) to propose a method for computing a solution from the relative interior of this set. Assuming that an arbitrary dual-optimal solution and an optimal assignment are available (for which many efficient algorithms already exist), our method computes a relative-interior solution in linear time. Since the LAP occurs as a subproblem in the linear programming (LP) relaxation of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), we employ our method as a new component in the family of dual-ascent algorithms that provide bounds on the optimal value of the QAP. To make our results applicable to the incomplete QAP, which is of interest in practical use-cases, we also provide a linear-time reduction from the incomplete LAP to the complete LAP along with a mapping that preserves optimality and membership in the relative interior. Our experiments on publicly available benchmarks indicate that our approach with relative-interior solution can frequently provide bounds near the optimum of the LP relaxation and its runtime is much lower when compared to a commercial LP solver.</description>

      <title>A Mini-Batch Quasi-Newton Proximal Method for Constrained Total-Variation Nonlinear Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the years, computational imaging with accurate nonlinear physical models has drawn considerable interest due to its ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions. However, such nonlinear models are computationally demanding. A popular choice for solving the corresponding inverse problems is accelerated stochastic proximal methods (ASPMs), with the caveat that each iteration is expensive. To overcome this issue, we propose a mini-batch quasi-Newton proximal method (BQNPM) tailored to image-reconstruction problems with total-variation regularization. It involves an efficient approach that computes a weighted proximal mapping at a cost similar to that of the proximal mapping in ASPMs. However, BQNPM requires fewer iterations than ASPMs to converge. We assess the performance of BQNPM on three-dimensional inverse-scattering problems with linear and nonlinear physical models. Our results on simulated and real data show the effectiveness and efficiency of BQNPM,</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores fundamental properties of convex interval-valued functions defined on Riemannian manifolds. The study employs generalized Hukuhara directional differentiability to derive KKT-type optimality conditions for an interval-valued optimization problem on Riemannian manifolds. Based on type of functions involved in optimization problems, we consider the following cases:
  1. objective function as well as constraints are real-valued;
  2. objective function is interval-valued, and constraints are real-valued;
  3. objective function as well as constraints are interval-valued.
  The whole theory is justified with the help of examples. The order relation that we use throughout the paper is a total order relation defined on the collection of all closed and bounded intervals in $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>On the power of linear programming for K-means clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [SIAM J. Optim., 2022], the authors introduced a new linear programming (LP) relaxation for K-means clustering. In this paper, we further investigate both theoretical and computational properties of this relaxation. As evident from our numerical experiments with both synthetic real-world data sets, the proposed LP relaxation is almost always tight; i.e. its optimal solution is feasible for the original nonconvex problem. To better understand this unexpected behaviour, on the theoretical side, we focus on K-means clustering with two clusters, and we obtain sufficient conditions under which the LP relaxation is tight. We further analyze the sufficient conditions when the input is generated according to a popular stochastic model and obtain recovery guarantees for the LP relaxation. We conclude our theoretical study by constructing a family of inputs for which the LP relaxation is never tight. Denoting by $n$ the number of data points to be clustered, the LP relaxation contains $\Omega(n^3)$ inequalities making it impractical for large data sets. To address the scalability issue, by building upon a cutting-plane algorithm together with the GPU implementation of PDLP, a first-order method LP solver, we develop an efficient algorithm that solves the proposed LP and hence the K-means clustering problem, for up to $n \leq 4000$ data points.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback Synthesis Orbit Geometry: Quotient Manifolds and LQG Direct Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider direct policy optimization for the linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. Over the past few years, it has been recognized that the landscape of dynamic output-feedback controllers of relevance to LQG has an intricate geometry, particularly pertaining to the existence of degenerate stationary points, that hinders gradient methods. In order to address these challenges, in this paper, we adopt a system-theoretic coordinate-invariant Riemannian metric for the space of dynamic output-feedback controllers and develop a Riemannian gradient descent for direct LQG policy optimization. We then proceed to prove that the orbit space of such controllers, modulo the coordinate transformation, admits a Riemannian quotient manifold structure. This geometric structure--that is of independent interest--provides an effective approach to derive direct policy optimization algorithms for LQG with a local linear rate convergence guarantee. Subsequently, we show that the proposed approach exhibits significantly faster and more robust numerical performance as compared with ordinary gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Nonconvergence of a sum-of-squares hierarchy for global polynomial optimization based on push-forward measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a closed set, and consider the problem of computing the minimum $f_{\min}$ of a polynomial $f$ on $\mathbf{X}$. Given a measure $\mu$ supported on $\mathbf{X}$, Lasserre (SIAM J. Optim. 21(3), 2011) proposes a decreasing sequence of upper bounds on $f_{\min}$, each of which may be computed by solving a semidefinite program. When $\mathbf{X}$ is compact, these bounds converge to $f_{\min}$ under minor assumptions on $\mu$. Later, Lasserre (Math. Program. 190, 2020) introduces a related, but far more economical sequence of upper bounds which rely on the push-forward measure of $\mu$ by $f$. While these new bounds are weaker a priori, they actually achieve similar asymptotic convergence rates on compact sets. In this work, we show that no such free lunch exists in the non-compact setting. While convergence of the standard bounds to $f_{\min}$ is guaranteed when $\mathbf{X} = \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mu$ is a Gaussian distribution, we prove that the bounds relying on the push-forward measure fail to converge to $f_{\min}$ in that setting already for polynomials of degree $6$.</description>

      <title>A Single-Loop Finite-Time Convergent Policy Optimization Algorithm for Mean Field Games (and Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding an equilibrium of a mean field game (MFG) -- a policy performing optimally in a Markov decision process (MDP) determined by the induced mean field, where the mean field is a distribution over a population of agents and a function of the policy itself. Prior solutions to MFGs are built upon either the contraction assumption on a mean field optimality-consistency operator or strict weak monotonicity. The class of problems satisfying these assumptions represent only a small subset of MFGs, to which any MFG admitting more than one equilibrium does not belong. In this work, we expand the class of solvable MFGs by introducing a "herding condition" and propose a direct gradient-based policy optimization algorithm that provably finds an (not necessarily unique) equilibrium within the class. The algorithm, named Accelerated Single-loop Actor Critic Algorithm for Mean Field Games (ASAC-MFG), is data-driven, single-loop, and single-sample-path. We characterize the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of ASAC-MFG to a mean field equilibrium building on a novel multi-time-scale analysis. We support the theoretical results with illustrative numerical simulations.
  As an additional contribution, we show how the developed novel analysis can benefit the literature on average-reward MDPs. An MFG reduces to a standard MDP when the transition kernel and reward are independent of the mean field. As a byproduct of our analysis for MFGs, we get an actor-critic algorithm for finding the optimal policy in average-reward MDPs, with a convergence guarantee matching the state-of-the-art. The prior bound is derived under the assumption that the Bellman operator is contractive, which never holds in average-reward MDPs. Our analysis removes this assumption.</description>

      <title>On modeling NP-Complete problems as polynomial-sized linear programs: Escaping/Side-stepping the "barriers"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07716v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view of the extended formulations (EFs) developments (e.g. "Fiorini, S., S. Massar, S. Pokutta, H.R. Tiwary, and R. de Wolf [2015]. Exponential Lower Bounds for Polytopes in Combinatorial Optimization. Journal of the ACM 62:2"), we focus in this paper on the question of whether it is possible to model an NP-Complete problem as a polynomial-sized linear program. For the sake of simplicity of exposition, the discussions are focused on the TSP. We show that a finding that there exists no polynomial-sized extended formulation of "the TSP polytope" does not (necessarily) imply that it is "impossible" for a polynomial-sized linear program to solve the TSP optimization problem. We show that under appropriate conditions the TSP optimization problem can be solved without recourse to the traditional city-to-city ("travel leg") variables, thereby side-stepping/"escaping from" "the TSP polytope" and hence, the barriers. Some illustrative examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>Learning Risk Preferences in Markov Decision Processes: an Application to the Fourth Down Decision in the National Football League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, National Football League (NFL) coaches' observed fourth down decisions have been largely inconsistent with prescriptions based on statistical models. In this paper, we develop a framework to explain this discrepancy using an inverse optimization approach. We model the fourth down decision and the subsequent sequence of plays in a game as a Markov decision process (MDP), the dynamics of which we estimate from NFL play-by-play data from the 2014 through 2022 seasons. We assume that coaches' observed decisions are optimal but that the risk preferences governing their decisions are unknown. This yields an inverse decision problem for which the optimality criterion, or risk measure, of the MDP is the estimand. Using the quantile function to parameterize risk, we estimate which quantile-optimal policy yields the coaches' observed decisions as minimally suboptimal. In general, we find that coaches' fourth-down behavior is consistent with optimizing low quantiles of the next-state value distribution, which corresponds to conservative risk preferences. We also find that coaches exhibit higher risk tolerances when making decisions in the opponent's half of the field as opposed to their own half, and that league average fourth down risk tolerances have increased over time.</description>

      <title>A non-intrusive neural-network based BFGS algorithm for parameter estimation in non-stationary elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a non-intrusive gradient and a non-intrusive BFGS algorithm for parameter estimation problems in non-stationary elasticity. To avoid multiple (and potentially expensive) solutions of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE), we approximate the PDE solver by a neural network within the algorithms. The network is trained offline for a given set of parameters. The algorithms are applied to an unsteady linear-elastic contact problem; their convergence and approximation properties are investigated numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project rank of the stable set polytopes of graphs with respect to the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP operator $\text{LS}_+$, with a particular focus on finding and characterizing the smallest graphs with a given $\text{LS}_+$-rank (the needed number of iterations of the $\text{LS}_+$ operator on the fractional stable set polytope to compute the stable set polytope). We introduce a generalized vertex-stretching operation that appears to be promising in generating $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs and study its properties. We also provide several new $\text{LS}_+$-minimal graphs, most notably the first known instances of $12$-vertex graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $4$, which provides the first advance in this direction since Escalante, Montelar, and Nasini's discovery of a $9$-vertex graph with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $3$ in 2006.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents self-organize on the enclosing shape around a fixed target. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a special potential function and sliding manifold. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>BiLO: Bilevel Local Operator Learning for PDE inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new neural network based method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) by formulating the PDE inverse problem as a bilevel optimization problem. At the upper level, we minimize the data loss with respect to the PDE parameters. At the lower level, we train a neural network to locally approximate the PDE solution operator in the neighborhood of a given set of PDE parameters, which enables an accurate approximation of the descent direction for the upper level optimization problem. The lower level loss function includes the L2 norms of both the residual and its derivative with respect to the PDE parameters. We apply gradient descent simultaneously on both the upper and lower level optimization problems, leading to an effective and fast algorithm. The method, which we refer to as BiLO (Bilevel Local Operator learning), is also able to efficiently infer unknown functions in the PDEs through the introduction of an auxiliary variable. Through extensive experiments over multiple PDE systems, we demonstrate that our method enforces strong PDE constraints, is robust to sparse and noisy data, and eliminates the need to balance the residual and the data loss, which is inherent to the soft PDE constraints in many existing methods.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Dynamical Properties of Safety Filters for Linear Planar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamical properties of closed-loop systems obtained from control barrier function-based safety filters. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of undesirable equilibria and show that the Jacobian matrix of the closed-loop system evaluated at an undesirable equilibrium always has a nonpositive eigenvalue. In the special case of linear planar systems and ellipsoidal obstacles, we give a complete characterization of the dynamical properties of the corresponding closed-loop system. We show that for underactuated systems, the safety filter always introduces a single undesirable equilibrium, which is a saddle-point. We prove that all trajectories outside the global stable manifold of such equilibrium converge to the origin. In the fully actuated case, we discuss how the choice of nominal controller affects the stability properties of the closed-loop system. Various simulations illustrate our results.</description>
