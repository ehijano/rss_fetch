      <title>An Agnostic Approach to Building Empirical Type Ia Supernova Light Curves: Evidence for Intrinsic Chromatic Flux Variation Using Nearby Supernova Factory Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new empirical Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) model with three chromatic flux variation templates: one phase dependent and two phase independent. No underlying dust extinction model or patterns of intrinsic variability are assumed. Implemented with Stan and trained using spectrally binned Nearby Supernova Factory spectrophotometry, we examine this model's 2D, phase-independent flux variation space using two motivated basis representations. In both, the first phase-independent template captures variation that appears dust-like, while the second captures a combination of effectively intrinsic variability and second-order dust-like effects. We find that approximately 13% of the modeled phase-independent flux variance is not dust-like. Previous empirical SN Ia models either assume an effective dust extinction recipe in their architecture, or only allow for a single mode of phase-independent variation. The presented results demonstrate such an approach may be insufficient, because it could "leak" noticeable intrinsic variation into phase-independent templates.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Type-C QPO during the soft-to-hard transition in Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timing analysis of accreting systems is key to probe the structure and dynamics around compact objects. In Black-Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (BH LMXBs), the compact object accretes matter from a low-mass companion star via Roche Lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk, and occasionally exhibiting bright eruptions. The BH LMXB Swift J1727.8-1613 (hereafter J1727), recently underwent one of the brightest outbursts ever recorded in X-rays, in August 2023. This analysis aims to study the timing properties of J1727, in the decaying phase of its outburst, using high-time resolution XMM-Newton data. We analyzed J1727's power spectrum (PS) and cross spectrum (CS), which we modeled with Lorentzians. The PS reveals how the source's power is distributed across frequencies, and the Real and Imaginary parts of the CS compare the displacement of the light curves in different energy bands across the observations. Finally, we simultaneously derived the phase lags and the coherence, using a constant phase lag model. While the first (soft-state) observation does not show any strong variability, the two harder observations exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Because the QPO is more significantly detected in the Imaginary part of the CS than in the PS, we refer to it as the 'Imaginary QPO'. The QPO is more prominent in the soft 0.3-2 keV band than in the hard 2-12 keV band. As the source evolves towards the hard state, the Imaginary QPO shifts to lower frequencies, the broadband fractional rms amplitude in the 0.3-2 keV energy band increases, while the rms covariance of the Imaginary QPO decreases. Simultaneously, the phase lags increase and the coherence function drops at the Imaginary QPO frequency. In the elusive soft-to-hard transition of J1727, the first XMM-Newton observations of the source reveal an Imaginary QPO also detected in the PS, exhibiting the properties of a type-C QPO.</description>

      <title>Impact of stellar winds on the pair-instability supernova rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars (VMSs, $M_{\star}$ $\geq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$) play a crucial role in several astrophysical processes. At low metallicity, they might collapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability supernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\,{}\mathrm{ yr}^{-1} \,{}\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability supernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict rates exceeding this limit. Here, we compute new VMS tracks with the MESA code, and use them to analyze the evolution of the (pulsational) pair-instability supernova rate density across cosmic time. We show that stellar wind models accounting for the transition between optically thin and thick winds yield a pair-instability supernova rate $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{PISN}}\sim{}0.1$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim{}0$, about two orders of magnitude lower than our previous models. We find that the main contribution to the pair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity $Z\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the pair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is up to 500 M$_\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for optically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as $Z\sim{4}\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the growth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in later evolutionary stages. This result highlights the critical role of mass loss in shaping the final fate of very massive stars and the rate of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Establishing a Connection Between the Jet and the Corona in Black Hole Low Mass X-Ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass black hole X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) undergo outbursts, during which their brightness increases greatly for timescales of months. The X-ray accretion and radio jet properties change dramatically throughout an outburst in a broadly consistent way between sources. Changes to the accretion flow and the corona are evident through X-ray spectral variations, while the jet's evolution produces changes in the radio. Typically, high energy emission from the corona initially dominate the X-ray spectrum, and quasi-steady compact jets are observed in the radio. As the outburst progresses, emission from the corona fades and is superseded by lower energy X-ray accretion disk emission. During this transition, the compact jets are quenched and discrete ejecta, called transient jets, are launched. The concurrence of the corona's weakening and the jet's transition from compact to transient implies a connection, but the precise relationship has not been established. Motivated by this, we aim to investigate the corona-jet connection. We perform spectral modeling in the hard and soft X-ray, utilizing $NuSTAR$, $NICER$, and $Swift$/XRT observations to track the evolving X-ray corona for three LMXBs: MAXI J1348-630, MAXI J1535-571 and MAXI J1820+070. We use prior work to mark the presence of compact jets and the dates of discrete jet ejections. We find a clear connection between the evolution of the corona and the jet: across all three sources an increase in the distance of the corona from the black hole occurs near the time that the compact jet is quenched and the transient jet is launched.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Detection of an Absorption Feature in ESP 39607: Evidence for an Ultra-fast Inflow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of an absorption feature at 4.8 keV in the NuSTAR spectra of ESP 39607, a Seyfert 2 galaxy at $z = 0.201$, observed in May 2023 and August 2024. The feature is detected in both observations with individual significance levels between 2 and 3$\sigma$, computed with multiple statistical methods. The combined probability of detecting it in both observations is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$. The absorption feature is consistent with an ultra-fast inflow (UFI) potentially associated with Fe XXV or Fe XXVI K$\alpha$ transitions. The inferred inflow velocity is $\sim$0.15-0.20$c$, with an estimated launching radius of 22-89 $R_g$, depending on the assumed iron transition and whether radiation pressure is accounted for. Photoionization modeling associates the UFI primarily with Fe XXV K$\alpha$ absorption, blended with a minor contribution from Fe XXVI K$\alpha$. Alternative explanations, including associations with the warm-hot intergalactic medium or outflows of lighter elements, were investigated but found unlikely. If confirmed, this detection represents a rare example of a UFI, providing valuable evidence into extreme and/or non-standard accretion processes near supermassive black holes. Follow-up observations with higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, such as with XMM-Newton or XRISM, will be essential to confirm the nature of this feature and better constrain the physical mechanisms driving it.</description>

      <title>Milli-arcsec X-ray positions and X-ray varstrometry for the strongly lensed AGN HE 0435-1223</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are some of the most powerful objects in the Universe. For this reason, they can be observed up to high redshifts (z), giving valuable insights into the evolution of our Universe. However, high-z AGN are too distant to be spatially resolved with current or upcoming X-ray facilities. In this paper we show how we can exploit gravitationally lensed AGN to significantly increase spatial resolution even at high-z. We combine astrometric data from Gaia DR3 with imaging from the Chandra X-ray Observatory of the quadruply-lensed quasar HE 0435--1223 to measure for the first time possible offsets between the optical and the X-ray emissions. We measure the X-ray source position for HE 0435-1223 within a 1$\sigma$ quasi-elliptical region of 0.5 x 1.3 milli-arcsecond (mas), about 150 pc$^2$ at the redshift of the source (z=1.689). We find evidence for the X-ray emission being offset by a projected 3 mas from the Gaia (optical) emission. The positional offset is most likely associated to a portion of the X-ray emission arising from an X-ray jet or outflow. We also discuss how this method can be used to indicate the presence of a binary/offset AGN system.</description>

      <title>Ground-based Observations of Temporal Variation of Cosmic Ray Spectrum during Forbush Decreases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of temporary Forbush decreases (FDs) in the Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux due to passage of solar storms are useful for space weather studies and alerts. Here we introduce techniques that use global networks of ground-based neutron monitors and muon detectors to measure variations of GCR rigidity spectra in space during FDs by: A) fitting count rate decreases for power-law rigidity spectra in space with anisotropy up to second order, and B) using the "leader fraction" derived from a single neutron monitor. We demonstrate that both provide consistent results for hourly spectral index variations for five major FDs and they agree with daily space-based data when available from AMS-02. We have also made the neutron monitor leader fraction publicly available in real time. This work verifies that ground-based observations can be used to precisely monitor GCR spectral variation over a wide range of rigidities during space weather events, with results in real time or from short-term post-analysis.</description>

      <title>Estimating the spins of supermassive black holes in distant ultraluminous quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimated spin, inclination angle and corresponding SMBH mass values for sample of extremely distant (6 &lt; z &lt; 7.5) ultraluminous quasars. The estimated spin values are on average greater that 0.9 and the spin distribution has a characteristic appearance, similar to ones obtained for other types of AGNs and quasars. The dependence of estimated parameters on each other shows strong correlations between them, from which we can assume that in this early quasars the growth of SMBHs mass should occur mainly due to disk accretion with high accretion rate, which very effectively increases the spin.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT discovery of a hyperactive repeating fast radio burst source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and localisation of a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source from the MeerTRAP project, a commensal fast radio transient search programme using the MeerKAT telescope. FRB 20240619D was first discovered on 2024 June 19 with three bursts being detected within two minutes in the MeerKAT L-band (856 - 1712MHz). We conducted follow-up observations of FRB 20240619D with MeerKAT using the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF; 544 - 1088MHz), L-band and S-band (1968 - 2843MHz) receivers one week after its discovery, and recorded a total of 249 bursts. The MeerKAT-detected bursts exhibit band-limited emission with an average fractional bandwidth of 0.31, 0.34 and 0.48 in the UHF, L-band and S-band, respectively. We find our observations are complete down to a fluence limit of ~1Jy ms, above which the cumulative burst rate follows a power law $R (&gt;F)\propto (F/1\,\text{Jy}\,\text{ms})^\gamma$ with $\gamma=-1.6\pm0.1$ and $-1.7\pm0.1$ in the UHF and L-band, respectively. The near-simultaneous L-band, UHF and S-band observations reveal a frequency dependent burst rate with $3\times$ more bursts being detected in the L-band than in the UHF and S-band, suggesting a spectral turnover in the burst energy distribution of FRB 20240619D. Our polarimetric analysis demonstrates that most of the bursts have $\sim100\%$ linear polarisation fractions and $\sim10\%\text{--}20\%$ circular polarisation fractions. We find no optical counterpart of FRB 20240619D in the MeerLICHT optical observations simultaneous to the radio observations and set a fluence upper limit in MeerLICHT's q-band of 0.76Jy ms and an optical-to-radio fluence ratio limit of 0.034 for a 15s exposure.</description>

      <title>Modelling the multi-wavelength emission and polarisation signatures of the novel white-dwarf pulsar system AR Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reclassification of AR Scorpii (AR Sco) from a delta Scuti variable star to a white dwarf binary system has initiated an in-depth exploration of this novel system. The main aim of this work was to develop a general emission code to concurrently model the emission maps, light curves, and spectra at various orbital phases for AR Sco. For the development of the emission code, I solved the general equations of motion with included classical radiation reaction forces (RRF) by implementing the Dormand-Prince 8(7) numerical integrator with adaptive time-step methods. This yielded improved accuracy and computational time vs. the commonly used Vay symplectic integrator, particularly for the high $B$-fields, $E_{\perp}$-fields, and RRF needed for pulsar and pulsar-like magnetospheres. Additionally, I demonstrated the novel result of the particles entering and conforming to the radiation reaction limit regime of Aristotelian Electrodynamics. As calibration for the radiation calculations, emission maps, and spectra I compared my model output with results from the code of the pulsar emission model of Harding and collaborators for a pulsar with $10\%$ the $B$-field strength of Vela and how my results converged to theirs. Next, I showed my exploratory modelling of the magnetic mirror scenario proposed for AR Sco. I demonstrate I could fit the observational spectral energy distribution including the recent \textit{NICER} pulsed X-ray spectrum well, constraining the white dwarf $B$-field to $B_{\rm S} = (2.5 - 3.0) \times 10^{8} \, \rm{G}$. Finally, I showed the effect the $B$-field, $E_{\perp}$-field, initial pitch angle, and initial particle Lorentz factor have on the mirror points, RRF, emission maps, and spectra. This demonstrates how crucial it is to include the general particle dynamics to accurately model the micro-physics present in magnetic mirror models.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Light Curve and Spectra of SN 2023aew</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the delayed conversion of a neutron star (NS) into either a quark star (QS) or a hybrid star (HS), occurring approximately 105-109 days after the supernova (SN) explosion, injects ~ 2e49 erg of thermal energy into the expanded SN ejecta. This energy, delivered over ~ 40 days via a quark-nova (QN) shock or the spin-down power of the HS, can reproduce the photometric and spectral features observed in SN 2023aew. In this model, the first light curve peak corresponds to the 56Ni-powered SN resulting from a stripped-envelope progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of at least ~ (15-16)M_sun. The plateau between the two peaks may result from interaction between the SN ejecta and circumstellar material (CSM). Alternatively, it could be explained by the spin-down power of the NS prior to its conversion into a highly magnetized HS, which is responsible for powering the second bump. A scenario involving two phases of spin-down power - first from the NS and later from the HS - is compelling and supports the hypothesis that some magnetars are, in fact, HSs. These HSs acquire their ultra-strong magnetic fields through a quark matter phase capable of sustaining core fields on the order of ~ 1e18 G. In our model, the spin-down energy of the HS powers the QN ejecta - the outermost layers of the NS - before this energy is transferred to the expanded SN ejecta. This process produces luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The model establishes a potential connection between superluminous SNe (SLSNe) and LFBOTs, with significant implications for high-energy astrophysics and the r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. Potential consequences for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Radio observations point to a moderately relativistic outflow in the fast X-ray transient EP241021a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) are short-lived X-ray outbursts with diverse progenitor scenarios, including compact object mergers, stellar core-collapses and tidal disruption events. The Einstein Probe (EP) has enabled the rapid discovery and follow-up of dozens of FXRTs, revealing that while some of them overlap with traditional gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), a larger fraction of FXRTs have no associated gamma-ray counterpart down to deep limits. The origin of these gamma-ray dark FXRTs and their connection to the diverse landscape of stellar explosions remains an open question, which can be tackled through the study of their multi-wavelength counterparts and environment.
  In this paper, we present long-term radio observations of the gamma-ray dark EP241021a, which exhibits sustained radio emission for over 100 days, placing it among the longest-lived radio afterglows. We detect signature of interstellar scintillation in early epochs, allowing us to constrain the angular size and Lorentz factor of the emitting region. Our observations point to an outflow that is at least mildly relativistic with Lorentz factor &gt; 4. Afterglow modeling favors a moderately relativistic and collimated outflow interacting with a low-density interstellar medium. The derived beaming-corrected kinetic energy and low radiative efficiency are consistent with a standard relativistic explosion which did not produce bright gamma-rays. Alternatively, a highly-relativistic structured jet remains consistent with our observations if seen substantially off-axis. In the latter case, the initial X-ray flare detected by EP would be caused by the slower ejecta from the lateral wings intercepting our line of sight rather than by traditional prompt-emission mechanisms within the jet core.</description>

      <title>Numerical Treatment of Shock-Induced Nuclear Burning in Double Detonation Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a benchmark problem to assess the treatment of shock-induced nuclear burning in the context of double detonation Type Ia supernovae. In a stratified white dwarf model, we implement a shock-detection criterion that suppresses burning in zones characterized by compression and significant pressure gradients, controlled by a tunable parameter, $f_{\rm shock}$. One-dimensional simulations, using the open-source Castro suite, were conducted across three treatments - burning fully enabled, and burning suppressed with $f_{\rm shock} = 2/3$ and $f_{\rm shock} = 1$ - across three spatial resolutions (5.0, 2.5, and 0.3125 km). At the finest resolution, the burning-enabled and $f_{\rm shock} = 1$ models converge, while the $f_{\rm shock} = 2/3$ front continues to show slight offset behavior. Since most simulations are carried out at much lower resolutions, our tests support the idea that burning in shocks should always be disabled in practice. We also observe that the behavior of lower-resolution simulations remains extremely sensitive to the choice of $f_{\rm shock}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous study we investigated the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions within a Finsler-Randers-type geometry. In this work we extend our analysis to charged and rotating solutions, focusing on the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-like metrics in the Finsler-Randers gravitational framework. In particular, we extract the modified gravitational field equations and we examine the geodesic equations, analyzing particle trajectories and quantifying the deviations from their standard counterparts. Moreover, we compare the results with the predictions of general relativity, and we discuss how potential deviations from Riemannian geometry could be reached observationally.</description>

      <title>White dwarfs in regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WDs), as the remnants of low to intermediate-mass stars, provide a unique opportunity to explore the interplay between quantum mechanical degeneracy pressure and gravitational forces under extreme conditions. In this study, we examine the structure and macroscopic properties of WDs within the framework of 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity, a modified theory that incorporates higher-order curvature corrections through the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant $\alpha$. Using the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations tailored for 4DEGB gravity, we analyze the hydrostatic equilibrium of WDs modeled with a realistic equation of state (EoS). Our findings reveal that the inclusion of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term significantly influences the mass-radius ($M-R$) relation, allowing for deviations from the Chandrasekhar mass limit. In particular, we observe that such stars become more compact and slightly smaller with the increase of the parameter $\alpha$. For WDs with $\vert\alpha\vert \leq 500\, \rm km^2$, the impact of 4DEGB gravity appears to be negligible. However, a larger range for $\alpha$ allows for appreciable changes in the $M-R$ diagram, mainly in the high-central-density region. Furthermore, we explore the role of anisotropic pressures, quantified by the parameter $\beta$, on such systems and demonstrate their impact on stability and compactness. For sufficiently large values of $\vert\beta\vert$ keeping negative $\beta$ with a large and positive $\alpha$, there exists a second stable branch according to the classical stability criterion $dM/d\rho_c &gt;0$. These results suggest that anisotropic WDs in 4DEGB gravity exhibit unique characteristics that distinguish them from their general relativistic counterparts, offering a novel testing ground for modified gravity theories in astrophysical settings.</description>

Abstract: Recently, we give the robust $\sim2\,\sigma$ evidences of dynamical dark matter and beyond $2\,\sigma$ signals of the coexistence of dynamical dark matter and dynamical dark energy using current cosmological observations [1]. Here we propose the quintessence dark matter model to explain the evolution of dark matter over time on cosmic scales. Interestingly, we find that the exponential quintessence is likely the origin of such an evolution.</description>

      <title>Propagation and transmission of Jupiter's internal waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from the Juno spacecraft show that Jupiter has a large dilute core rather than a compact core. To investigate the effects of different core structures on wave propagation and transmission in Jupiter's interior, we consider three models: (1) an isentropic sphere, (2) an isentropic envelope with a rigid core, and (3) an isentropic envelope with a dilute core. We study the propagation and transmission of p modes (sound waves), g modes (gravity waves), r modes (inertial waves), and GIWs (gravito-inertial waves) by solving the linear equations of a compressible, self-gravitating, uniformly rotating polytropic model, fully taking into account the the effects of Coriolis force but neglecting centrifugal flattening. Our results show that energy flux is primarily carried by fast waves with higher frequencies whereas kinetic energy by slow waves with lower frequencies. Rotation has a greater effect on non-axisymmetric modes than on axisymmetric ones. In model 2, rigid core facilitates propagation of r modes. In model 3, rotation enhances the transmission of GIWs across the interface between the dilute core and the isentropic envelope, particularly at high latitudes. This suggests that Jupiter's internal structure may be inferred by detecting the oscillation signals in its polar regions.</description>

      <title>The Statistics of Gas Density, Velocity, and Magnetic Fields in Cool-Core Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence within the Intracluster Medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters is pivotal for comprehending their evolution and dynamics. Employing 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, we examine the statistical properties of gas density, magnetic fields, and velocity, particularly emphasizing the central regions spanning 400 kpc. The simulations feature varied initial plasma $\beta$ values (100, 200, and 500), mirroring conditions in massive cool-core clusters such as Perseus. Our findings indicate that while the statistical histogram distributions of gas density and velocity appear similar across different $\beta$ scenarios, their spatial distributions and morphological patterns exhibit noticeable differences. Through the application of the second-order structure function, we identified a scaling relation in velocity fluctuations, characterized by a slope of 1/2 and predominantly dominated by solenoidal components. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with more significant fluctuations along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields. This anisotropy is scale-dependent, becoming more pronounced at smaller scales, and exhibits a decreasing trend in scenarios where the magnetic field is relatively weak, particularly at $\beta=500$. This suggests that the anisotropic nature of these fluctuations is predominantly regulated by the magnetic fields. Additionally, we test the efficacy of the Synchrotron Intensity Gradient (SIG) method for tracing magnetic fields in these environments. The SIG shows a global agreement with the magnetic field across all three $\beta$ scenarios, confirming the SIG's insensitivity to the medium's magnetization level.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensated Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we obtain a spherically symmetric traversable wormhole (WH) in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity with Bose-Einstein condensated (BEC) dark matter. We consider 4D EGB gravity, which one obtains by regularizing the higher dimensional EGB gravity in the limit $D \to 4$. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter ($\alpha$) in this case is rescaled to $\alpha \to \frac{\alpha}{D-4}$. Considering the energy density profile of non-relativistic BEC matter, the shape function of the WH geometry is determined. The applicability of realistic flaring-out condition and asymptotic flatness conditions are explored here and we determined a domain of model parameters for realistic scenario. We analyse the embedding diagram of the WH obtained here with the study of the proper radial distance, volume integral quantifier, and anisotropy measurement in this model. The vanishing sound speed in the model is analyzed, and found that the WH is stable at the throat for $\alpha = -0.0512471$ for a set of model parameters. The energy conditions are investigated, and we found that the energy conditions are satisfied at the throat of the WH for a range of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter, $\alpha \in [-4,-4.222]$. We obtained a new result where the energy conditions are violated at the throat of the WH except for the above range of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of recaptures, ejections and mergers of stellar mass binaries over multiple encounters with SgrA*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common origin for a host of stellar phenomena in galactic centres is the tidal encounter between stellar binaries and a massive black hole (MBH), known as the ``Hills mechanism''. Following the encounter, binaries may disrupt into an ejected star and a captured one, they may merge, or survive to either fly away or come back for one or more subsequent encounters, until they are either disrupted or fly away. In this paper, we analyse how a binary's fate depends on its orbital parameters, by following its evolution through up to three subsequent pericentre passages. We choose an initial population of circular binaries on parabolic orbits. We present results from our restricted three-body formalism, whose strength lies in the ability to easily explore a multidimensional parameter space and make predictions independent of the binary physical properties. We find that fates depend strongly on orbital inclination, how deep the encounter is into the MBH tidal sphere and on the binary eccentricity, developed during encounters. Generally, non retrograde trajectories, high eccentricities or deep encounters produce disruptions preferentially. Disruption is the most common fate. A significant fraction of the surviving binaries fly away at velocities typically two orders of magnitude smaller than those of ejected stars. Multiple encounters boost disruptions by 20\% or more. Finally, using an example system, we investigate the effect of finite stellar sizes and lifetimes, showing that mergers occur 31\% of the time, and that disruptions are still boosted by 10\% through subsequent passages.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) use an array of millisecond pulsars to search for gravitational waves in the nanohertz regime in pulse time of arrival data. This paper presents rigorous tests of PTA methods, examining their consistency across the relevant parameter space. We discuss updates to the 15-year isotropic gravitational-wave background analyses and their corresponding code representations. Descriptions of the internal structure of the flagship algorithms Enterprise and PTMCMCSampler are given to facilitate understanding of the PTA likelihood structure, how models are built, and what methods are currently used in sampling the high-dimensional PTA parameter space. We introduce a novel version of the PTA likelihood that uses a two-step marginalization procedure that performs much faster in gravitational wave searches, reducing the required resources facilitating the computation of Bayes factors via thermodynamic integration and sampling a large number of realizations for computing Bayesian false-alarm probabilities. We perform stringent tests of consistency and correctness of the Bayesian and frequentist analysis methods. For the Bayesian analysis, we test prior recovery, simulation recovery, and Bayes factors. For the frequentist analysis, we test that the optimal statistic, when modified to account for a non-negligible gravitational-wave background, accurately recovers the amplitude of the background. We also summarize recent advances and tests performed on the optimal statistic in the literature from both GWB detection and parameter estimation perspectives. The tests presented here validate current analyses of PTA data.</description>

      <title>Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion. On the other hand, classifying each individual binary component suffers from an inherent labeling ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>

Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>The interplay of astrophysics and nuclear physics in determining the properties of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star properties depend on both nuclear physics and astrophysical processes, and thus observations of neutron stars offer constraints on both large-scale astrophysics and the behavior of cold, dense matter. In this study, we use astronomical data to jointly infer the universal equation of state of dense matter along with two distinct astrophysical populations: Galactic neutron stars observed electromagnetically and merging neutron stars in binaries observed with gravitational waves. We place constraints on neutron star properties and quantify the extent to which they are attributable to macrophysics or microphysics. We confirm previous results indicating that the Galactic and merging neutron stars have distinct mass distributions. The inferred maximum mass of both Galactic neutron stars, $M_{\rm pop, EM}=2.05^{+0.11}_{-0.06}\,M_{\odot}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible interval), and merging neutron star binaries, $M_{\rm pop, GW}=1.85^{+0.39}_{-0.16}\,M_{\odot}$, are consistent with the maximum mass of nonrotating neutron stars set by nuclear physics, $M_{\rm TOV} =2.28^{+0.41}_{-0.21}\,M_\odot$. The radius of a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star is $12.2^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\,$km, consistent with, though $\sim 20\%$ tighter than, previous results using an identical equation of state model. Even though observed Galactic and merging neutron stars originate from populations with distinct properties, there is currently no evidence that astrophysical processes cannot produce neutron stars up to the maximum value imposed by nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Coincident Multimessenger Bursts from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive binary black holes are a key target for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and excellent multimessenger sources across the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. However, unique features of their EM emission that are needed to distinguish them from single supermassive black holes are still being established. Here, we conduct the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation of disk accretion onto equal-mass, nonspinning, eccentric binary black holes in full general relativity, incorporating synchrotron radiation transport through the dual jet in postprocessing. Focusing on a binary in the strong-field dynamical spacetime regime with eccentricity e = 0.3 as a point of principle, we show that the total accretion rate exhibits periodicity on the binary orbital period. We also show, for the first time, that this periodicity is reflected in the jet Poynting luminosity and the optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet base. Furthermore, we find a distinct EM signature for eccentric binaries: they spend more time in a low emission state (at apocenter) and less in a high state (at pericenter). Additionally, we find that the eccentric binary quasiperiodic gravitational-wave (GW) bursts are coincident with the bursts in Poynting luminosity and synchrotron emission. Finally, we discuss how multimessenger EM and GW observations of these systems can help probe plasma physics in their jet.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stochastic acceleration in black hole environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experimental results from the IceCube detector and their phenomenological interpretation suggest that the magnetized turbulent corona of nearby X-ray luminous Seyfert galaxies can produce $\sim 1-10\,$TeV neutrinos via photo-hadronic interactions. We investigate the physics of stochastic acceleration in these environments in detail and examine the conditions under which the inferred proton spectrum can be explained. To this end, we used recent findings on particle acceleration in turbulence and paid particular attention to the transport equation, notably for transport in momentum space, turbulent transport outside of the corona, and advection through the corona. We first remark that the spectra we obtained are highly sensitive to the value of the acceleration rate, for instance, to the Alfv\'enic velocity. Then, we examined three prototype scenarios, one scenario of turbulent acceleration in the test-particle picture, another scenario in which particles were preaccelerated by turbulence and further energized by shear acceleration, and a final scenario in which we considered the effect of particle backreaction on the turbulence (damping), which self-regulates the acceleration process. We show that it is possible to obtain satisfactory fits to the inferred proton spectrum in all three cases, but we stress that in the first two scenarios, the energy content in suprathermal protons has to be fixed in an ad hoc manner to match the inferred spectrum at an energy density close to that contained in the turbulence. Interestingly, self-regulated acceleration by turbulence damping naturally brings the suprathermal particle energy content close to that of the turbulence and allowed us to reproduce the inferred flux level without additional fine-tuning.

      <description>arXiv:2412.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for an excess of electrons and positrons in the interplanetary space from the decays of heavy neutrinos produced in nuclear reactions in the Sun. Using measurements of the electron spectra in the MeV range from the Ulysses and SOHO satellites, we report the strongest direct upper bound to date on the mixing between heavy neutral leptons with MeV masses and electron neutrinos, reaching $U_e^2\simeq 10^{-6}$ at $M_N=10\,$MeV. Our sensitivity is predominantly constrained by the uncertainties in the propagation of electrons and positrons, particularly the diffusion coefficient in the inner Solar System, as well as the uncertainties in the astrophysical background. Enhancing our understanding of either of these factors could lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Merging our supernova code F{\sc{ornax}} with the Box3D fast-flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, we explore the effects of fast-flavor conversion (FFC) in state-of-the-art 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations. We find that after a few tens of milliseconds after bounce the FFC emerges just interior to and exterior to the stalled shock wave. It does not obtain in the PNS core nor near the average neutrinosphere radii. Interior to the shock, this results in a temporary change in the net neutrino heating rate of $\sim$10\%, due mostly to a hardening of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrino spectra, despite the decrease in their corresponding neutrino number fluxes. In 1D, the hydrodynamic effects are not large, with increases in the stalled shock radius by of order ten to twenty kilometers that abate within a few hundred milliseconds. In 2D, the hydrodynamic effect of the FFC is a bit more noticeable, resulting in slightly earlier explosions for models for lower-mass progenitors, but also potentially inhibiting explosions for some higher-mass progenitors. Fast-flavor conversion continues to operate at larger radii at later times. The net result is a shift upward in the $\nu_{\mu}$ energy and number luminosities and a shift downward in the same quantities for both the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos. There seems to be a trend at very large radii and later times towards partial species and spectral equipartition. If this is true, it could be an interesting feature of supernova neutrino detection at later times in underground and under-ice facilities.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of inclined extensive air showers using radio signals: from arrival times and amplitudes to direction and energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio detection is now an established technique for the study of ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays with energies above $\sim10^{17}$ eV. The next-generation of radio experiments aims to extend this technique to the observation of UHE earth-skimming neutrinos, which requires the detection of very inclined extensive air showers (EAS). In this article we present a new reconstruction method for the arrival direction and the energy of EAS. It combines a point-source-like description of the radio wavefront with a phenomenological model: the Angular Distribution Function (ADF). The ADF describes the angular distribution of the radio signal amplitude in the 50-200 MHz frequency range, with a particular focus on the Cherenkov angle, a crucial feature of the radio amplitude pattern. The method is applicable to showers with zenith angles larger than $60^\circ$, and in principle up to neutrino-induced showers with up-going trajectories. It is tested here on a simulated data set of EAS induced by cosmic rays. A resolution better than 4 arc-minutes ($0.07^\circ$) is achieved on arrival direction, as well as an intrinsic resolution of 5% on the electromagnetic energy, and around 15% on the primary energy.</description>

      <title>Rotation and dispersion measure evolution of repeating fast radio bursts propagating through a magnetar flare ejecta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotation measure (RM) and dispersion measure (DM) are characteristic properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs) that contain important information of their source environment. The time evolution of RM and DM is more inclined to be ascribed to local plasma in the host galaxy rather than the intergalactic medium or free electrons in the Milky Way. Recently a sudden drastic RM change was reported for an active repeating FRB 20220529, implying that some kind of mass ejection happened near the source. In this work I suggest that magnetar flare ejecta could play this role and give rise to the significant RM change. I introduce a toy structured ejecta model and calculate the contribution to RM and DM by a typical flare event. I find that this model could reproduce the RM behaviour of FRB 20220529 well under reasonable parameters, and similar sudden change is expected as long as this source maintains its activity.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescence Gravitational Wave Signals Counting and Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As next-generation gravitational-wave (GW) observatories approach unprecedented sensitivities, the need for robust methods to analyze increasingly complex, overlapping signals becomes ever more pressing. Existing matched-filtering approaches and deep-learning techniques can typically handle only one or two concurrent signals, offering limited adaptability to more varied and intricate superimposed waveforms. To overcome these constraints, we present the UnMixFormer, an attention-based architecture that not only identifies the unknown number of concurrent compact binary coalescence GW events but also disentangles their individual waveforms through a multi-decoder architecture, even when confronted with five overlapping signals. Our UnMixFormer is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies by modeling them in a dual-path manner, while also enhancing periodic feature representation by incorporating Fourier Analysis Networks. Our approach adeptly processes binary black hole, binary neutron star, and neutron star-black hole systems over extended time series data (16,384 samples). When evaluating on synthetic data with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 10 to 50, our method achieves 99.89% counting accuracy, a mean overlap of 0.9831 between separated waveforms and templates, and robust generalization ability to waveforms with spin precession, orbital eccentricity, and higher modes, marking a substantial advance in the precision and versatility of GW data analysis.</description>

      <title>SN 2023ixf: interaction signatures in the spectrum at 445 days</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf is one of the most neaby and brightest Type II supernovae (SNe) of the past decades. A rich set of pre-explosion data provided important insight on the properties of the progenitor star. There has been a wide range of estimated initial masses of 9 - 22 $M{_\odot}$. Early monitoring of the SN also showed the presence of a dense CSM structure near the star ($10^{15}$ cm) that was probably expelled in the last years prior to the explosion. These extended CSM structure can be further probed with late-time observations during the nebular phase. This study is based on a nebular spectrum obtained with GMOS at the Gemini North Telescope 445 days after explosion. The SN evolution is analyzed in comparison with a previous spectrum at an age of 259 days, and compared with those of similar SNe II and with synthetic radiation-transfer nebular spectra. The 445-d spectrum exhibits a dramatic evolution with clear signs of ejecta-CSM interaction. The H${\alpha}$ profile shows a complex profile that can be separated into a boxy component arising from the interaction with a CSM shell and a central peaked component that may be due to the radioactive-powered SN ejecta. The CSM shell would be located at a distance of $\approx10^{16}$ cm from the progenitor and it may be associated with mass loss occurring up until $\approx 500 - 1000$ years before the explosion. Similar interaction signatures have been detected in other SNe II, although for events with standard plateau durations this happened at times later than 600 - 700 days. SN 2023ixf appears to belong to a group of SNe II with short plateaus or linear light curves that develop interaction features before $\approx 500$ days. Other lines, such as those from [O I] and [Ca II] appear to be unaffected by the CSM interaction. This allowed us to estimate an initial progenitor mass, which resulted in the relatively low range of 10 - 15 $M{_\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static, axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic rate and a constant offset, which we express in terms of coordinate-invariant curvature evaluated at the unstable photon circular orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>
