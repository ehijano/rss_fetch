      <title>On Geometry, Arithmetics and Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our main result is that chaos in dimension $n+1$ is a one-dimensional geometrical object embedded in a geometrical object of dimension $n$ which corresponds to a $n$ dimensional object which is either singular or non-singular. Our main result is then that this chaos occurs in the first case as either on an isolated or non-isolated singularity. In the first case this chaos is either boundary chaos or spherical chaos which is what happens also in the non-singular case. In the case of an isolated singular geometry one has chaos which can either be boundary, spherical or tubular chaos. We furthermore prove that the prime numbers display quantum behaviour.</description>

      <title>On the desingularisation of moduli of principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{nr} Narasimhan and Ramanan and in \cite{desing}, Seshadri constructed desingularisations of the moduli space $M^{ss}_{_{\text{SL}(2)}}$ of semistable $\SL(2)$-bundles on a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g \geq 3$. Seshadri's construction was even modular and canonical. In this paper, we construct a smooth modular compactification of the moduli of stable principal $H$-bundles when $H$ is a simply connected almost simple algebraic group of type ${\tt B}_{_\ell}, {\tt D}_{_\ell}, {\tt G}_{_2}, {\tt F}_{_4}~~or~~{\tt C}_{_3}$. These spaces give canonical desingularisations of the moduli space $M^{ss}_{_H}$ of semistable principal $H$-bundles and thereby, a comprehensive generalisation of \cite{desing}.</description>

      <title>Modular sheaves with many moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit moduli spaces of slope stable vector bundles on general polarized HK varieties $(X,h)$ of type $K3^{[2]}$ which have an irreducible component of dimension $2a^2+2$, with $a$ an arbitrary integer greater than $1$. This is done by studying the case $X=S^{[2]}$ where $S$ is an elliptic $K3$ surface. We show that in this case there is an irreducible component of the moduli space of stable vector bundles on $S^{[2]}$ which is birational to a moduli space of sheaves on $S$. We expect that if the moduli space of sheaves on $S$ is a smooth HK variety (necessarily of type $K3^{[a^2+1]}$) then the following more precise version holds: the closure of the moduli space of slope stable vector bundles on $(X,h)$ in the moduli space of Gieseker-Maruyama semistable sheaves with its GIT polarization is a general polarized HK variety of type $K3^{[a^2+1]}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the maximum dimension of a linear system of plane cubic curves whose $\mathbb{F}_q$-members are all geometrically irreducible. Computational evidence suggests that such a system has a maximum (projective) dimension of $3$. As a step towards the conjecture, we prove that there exists a $3$-dimensional linear system $\mathcal{L}$ with at most one geometrically reducible $\mathbb{F}_q$-member.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decomposition locus of a tensor is the set of rank-one tensors appearing in a minimal tensor-rank decomposition of the tensor. For tensors lying on the tangential variety of any Segre variety, but not on the variety itself, we show that the decomposition locus consists of all rank-one tensors except the tangency point only. We also explicitly compute decomposition loci of all tensors belonging to tensor spaces with finitely many orbits with respect to the action of product of general linear groups.</description>

      <title>Euler Stratifications of Hypersurface Families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We stratify families of projective and very affine hypersurfaces according to their topological Euler characteristic. Our new algorithms compute all strata using algebro-geometric techniques. For very affine hypersurfaces, we investigate and exploit the relation to critical point computations. Euler stratifications are relevant in particle physics and algebraic statistics. They fully describe the dependence of the number of master integrals, respectively the maximum likelihood degree, on kinematic or model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joyce structures are a class of geometric structures which first arose in relation to holomorphic generating functions for Donaldson-Thomas invariants. They can be thought of as non-linear analogues of Frobenius structures, or as special classes of complex hyperkahler manifolds. We give a detailed introduction to Joyce structures, with particular focus on the geometry of the associated twistor space. We also prove several new results.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the Kinematics of Origami Mechanisms With Spring Joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its rigid foldability and predictable kinematics, the reverse fold is the fundamental mechanism behind some of the most well known origami kinematic structures, including the Miura Ori, Yoshimura, and waterbomb patterns. However, the reverse fold only has one parameter to control its behavior: the starting fold angle. In this paper I introduce an alternative to the traditional reverse fold, based on the spring into action pattern, called the spring joint. This novel rigidly foldable mechanism is able to couple multiple reverse folds into a compact space to amplify the kinematic output of a traditional reverse fold by up to ten times, and to add one parameter for each reverse fold, giving more programmatic control of origami structures. Methods of parameterizing both the starting angle, the path of travel, and the axis of motion are also introduced. Unfortunately, this versatility comes at the cost of a large buildup of layers, making the spring joint impractical for thick origami mechanisms. To solve this problem, I also introduce a modular alternative to the spring joint that has no additional layers, with the same kinematic properties. Both of these mechanisms are tested as replacements for the reverse fold in both traditional and custom origami structures.</description>

Abstract: This paper is a first step in the study of nonstandard graded algebras having Poincar\'e duality and their Lefschetz properties. We prove the equivalence between the toric setup and the G-graded one, generalize Macaulay-Matlis duality, introduce Lefschetz properties and prove a Hessian criteria in the G-graded setup. We prove a special case of the Codimension One Conjecture of Cattani-Cox-Dickenstein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>

      <title>Generalized superelliptic Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.09576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A closed Riemann surface $\mathcal X$, of genus $g \geq 2$, is called a generalized superelliptic curve of level $n \geq 2$ if it admits an order $n$ conformal automorphism $\tau$ so that $\mathcal X/\langle \tau \rangle$ has genus zero and $\tau$ is central in ${\rm Aut}(\mathcal X)$; the cyclic group $H=\langle \tau \rangle$ is called a generalized superelliptic group of level $n$ for $\mathcal X$. These Riemann surfaces are natural generalizations of hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces (when $n=2$). We provide an algebraic curve description of these Riemann surfaces in terms of their groups of automorphisms. Also, we observe that the generalized superelliptic group $H$ of level $n$ is unique, with the exception of a very particular family of exceptional generalized superelliptic Riemann surfaces for $n$ even. In particular, the uniqueness holds if either: (i) $n$ is odd or (ii) the quotient $\mathcal X/H$ has all its cone points of order $n$ (for instance, when $\mathcal X$ is a superelliptic curve of level $n$). In the non-exceptional case, we use this uniqueness property of its generalized superelliptic group $H$ to observe that the corresponding curves are definable over their fields of moduli if ${\rm Aut}(\mathcal X)/H$ is neither trivial or cyclic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argued in the paper "Geometry from Donaldson-Thomas invariants" that, when a certain sub-exponential growth property holds, the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of a 3-Calabi-Yau triangulated category should define a geometric structure on its space of stability conditions. In this paper we show how to associate a generating function to these geometric structures which we call the tau function. In the case of the derived category of the resolved conifold, this function reproduces the non-perturbative topological string partition function introduced in the paper "Riemann-Hilbert problems for the resolved conifold". In the case of the A2 quiver it is the Painleve I tau function. The definition of the tau-function depends on certain choices of additional data which we discuss in the paper. There is still much to understand!</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series and the length of triangulated categories, and we study compositions series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. For example, we compute the length of the derived category ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ and classify all finite length thick subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$. Furthermore, we prove that the derived categories of certain smooth projective varieties have composition series of different lengths. We also discuss the length of (1) derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, (2) derived categories of some singular varieties and (3) Krah's phantom subcategories.</description>

Abstract: We prove an asymptotic product formula for the refined BPS invariants associated with a local del Pezzo surface. Our formula governs the cohomological stabilization of the perverse filtration on the intersection cohomology of the moduli space of 1-dimensional semistable sheaves on a del Pezzo surface. Combined with the theory of Fourier transform of Maulik--Shen--Yin, we show that the perverse filtration matches asymptotically with the Chern filtration defined via tautological classes. In the case of the projective plane, our results resolve conjectures of Kononov--Pi--Shen.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Symplectic Automorphisms of Supersingular K3 surfaces in Odd Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2009, Dolgachev-Keum show that finite groups of tame symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces in positive characteristics are subgroups of the Mathieu group of degree 23 under mild conditions. In this paper, we utilize lattice-theoretic methods to investigate symplectic actions of finite groups G on K3 surfaces in odd characteristics. In the tame cases (i.e., the order of G is coprime with p) and all the superspecial cases, one can associate with the action a Leech pair which can be detected via H\"ohn-Mason's list. Notice that the superspecial cases have been resolved by Ohashi-Sch\"utt. If the K3 surface is supersingular with Artin invariant at least two, we develop a new machinery called p-root pairs to detect possible symplectic finite group actions (without the assumption of tameness). The concept of p-root pair is closely related to root systems and Weyl groups. In particular, we recover many results by Dolgachev-Keum with a different method and give an upper bound for the exponent of p in |G|.</description>

      <title>Bounded $t$-structures, finitistic dimensions, and singularity categories of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Amnon Neeman settled a bold conjecture by Antieau, Gepner, and Heller regarding the relationship between the regularity of finite-dimensional noetherian schemes and the existence of bounded $t$-structures on their derived categories of perfect complexes.
  In this paper, using different methods, we prove some very general results about the existence of bounded $t$-structures on (not necessarily algebraic or topological) triangulated categories and their invariance under completion. We show that if the opposite category of an essentially small triangulated category has finite finitistic dimension in our sense, then the existence of a bounded t-structure on it forces it to be equal to its completion. We also prove a parallel result regarding the equivalence of all bounded t-structures on any intermediate triangulated category between the starting category and its completion.
  Our general treatment, when specialized to the case of schemes, immediately gives us Neeman's theorem as an application and significantly generalizes another remarkable theorem by Neeman about the equivalence of bounded $t$-structures on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. When specialized to other cases like associative rings, nonpositive DG-rings, connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings, triangulated categories without models, etc., we get many other applications. Under mild finiteness assumptions, these results not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in our sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all bounded $t$-structures are equivalent. The strategy used in our treatment is introducing a new concept of finitistic dimension for triangulated categories and lifting $t$-structures along completions of triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>A generalized Saito freeness criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish generalizations of Saito's criterion for the freeness of divisors in projective spaces that apply both to sequences of several homogeneous polynomials and to divisors on other complete varieties. As an application, the new criterion is applied to several examples, including sequences whose polynomials depend on disjoint sets of variables, some sequences that are equivariant for the action of a linear group, blow-ups of divisors, and certain sequences of polynomials in positive characteristics.</description>

      <title>Certified simultaneous isotopic approximation of curves via subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm based on subdivision for computing an isotopic approximation to any number of curves in the plane. Our algorithm is based on the certified curve approximation algorithm of Plantinga and Vegter. The main challenge in this algorithm is to correctly and efficiently identify and isolate all intersections between the curves. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a new and simple test that guarantees the global correctness of our output. A main step in our algorithm for approximating any number of curves is to correctly approximate a pair of curves. In addition to developing the details of this special case, we provide complexity analyses for both the number of steps and the bit-complexity of this algorithm using both worst-case bounds as well as those based on continuous amortization.</description>
