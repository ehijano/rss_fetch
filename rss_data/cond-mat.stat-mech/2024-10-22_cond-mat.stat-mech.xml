      <title>Nanothermodynamics: There's plenty of room on the inside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanothermodynamics provides the theoretical foundation for understanding stable distributions of statistically independent subsystems inside larger systems. In this review it is emphasized that adapting ideas from nanothermodynamics to simplistic models improves agreement with the measured properties of many materials. Examples include non-classical critical scaling near ferromagnetic transitions, thermal and dynamic behavior near liquid-glass transitions, and the 1/f-like noise in metal films and qubits. A key feature in several models is to allow separate time steps for distinct conservation laws: one type of step conserves energy and the other conserves momentum (e.g. dipole alignment). This "orthogonal dynamics" explains how the relaxation of a single parameter can exhibit multiple responses such as primary, secondary, and microscopic peaks in the dielectric loss of supercooled liquids, and the crossover in thermal fluctuations from Johnson-Nyquist (white) noise at high frequencies to 1/f-like noise at low frequencies. Nanothermodynamics also provides new insight into three basic questions. First, it gives a novel solution to Gibbs' paradox for the entropy of the semi-classical ideal gas. Second, it yields the stable equilibrium of Ising's original model for finite-sized chains of interacting binary degrees of freedom ("spins"). Third, it confronts Loschmidt's paradox for the arrow of time, showing that an intrinsically irreversible step is required for maximum entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, not only in the thermodynamic limit but also in systems as small as N=2 particles</description>

      <title>Integrable and critical Haagerup spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first integrable models based on the Haagerup fusion category $H_3$. We introduce a Haagerup version of the anyonic spin chain and use the boost operator formalism to identify two integrable Hamiltonians of PXP type on this chain. The first of these is an analogue of the golden chain; it has a topological symmetry based on $H_3$ and satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra with parameter $\delta=(3+\sqrt{13})/2$. We prove its integrability using a Lax formalism, and construct the corresponding solution to the Yang--Baxter equation. We present numerical evidence that this model is gapless with a dynamical critical exponent $z\neq 1$. The second integrable model we find breaks the topological symmetry. We present numerical evidence that this model reduces to a CFT in the large volume limit with central charge $c\sim3/2$.</description>

      <title>On the Bisognano-Wichmann entanglement Hamiltonian of nonrelativistic fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state entanglement Hamiltonian of free nonrelativistic fermions for semi-infinite domains in one dimension. This is encoded in the two-point correlations projected onto the subsystem, an operator that commutes with the linear deformation of the physical Hamiltonian. The corresponding eigenfunctions are shown to possess the exact same structure both in the continuum as well as on the lattice. Namely, they are superpositions of the occupied single-particle modes of the total Hamiltonian, weighted by the inverse of their energy as measured from the Fermi level, and multiplied by an extra phase proportional to the integrated weight. Using this ansatz, we prove that the Bisognano-Wichmann form of the entanglement Hamiltonian becomes exact, up to a nonuniversal prefactor that depends on the dispersion for gapped chains.</description>

      <title>Geometric Study on Noncommutativity in Canonical Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition, canonical average provides equilibrium configuration from a set of many-body interactions, which typically acts as nonlinear map. The nonlinearity has recently been investigated in terms of configurational geometry, where two measures for the nonlinearity as vector field on configuration space and divergence on statistical manifold are introduced. Then, concepts of these measures are further unified through stochastic thermodynamic treatment. While these studies provide deeper insight into understanding the nonlinearity, thermodynamic treatment for non-separability in structural degrees of freedom (NS), still remains difficult due mainly to nonexistence of the corresponding CDOS. Our recent study partially overcome the problem, by considering additional information of non-commutativity for the nonlinearity (NC). The present study focuses on the basic behavior of the NC, in terms of the geometric information about configurational geometry, much more easily-accesible information than NC. For this purpose, we here employ the coarse-grained state model (CSM) that can qualitatively capture the nonlinearity information through the coarse-grained configuration space with tractable numbers of parameters, where the present CSM can implicitly include the difference in coordination numbers on real lattice. We find that (i) the NC exhibit positive correlation with asymmetric Hausdorff distance in configurational polyhedra between of pracitcal and separable systems in terms of SDFs, especially for partically-ordered-state-rich region, (ii) the NC take lower value when the difference in coordination number becomes small, indicating that we can obtain better thermodynamic bound for NS in such systems, and (iii) the positive correlation can be further modified when we additionally include information about nonseparability in the practical CDOS.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations: From Identities to Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes, we derive exact Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) that express the covariance between any pair of currents in terms of static responses in a notably simple form, thus generalizing the fluctuation-dissipation theorem far from equilibrium. We begin by considering perturbations in the symmetric part of the rates. We demonstrate that FRRs imply a hierarchy of thermodynamic bounds. These latter prove the recently conjectured Response Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (R-TUR), which bounds the ratio between any current's response and its variance by the entropy production rate (EPR). We furthermore strengthen this bound in two distinct ways, using partial EPR in one case and pseudo-EPR in the other. For perturbations in the antisymmetric part of the rates, we show that the ratio between any current's response and its variance is bounded by traffic, a metric representing the total number of transitions per unit time in the system. As an application, we use FRRs to explain the origin of positive correlations between currents in Coulomb-blockaded systems previously observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Universal time evolution of string order parameter in quantum critical systems with boundary invertible or non-invertible symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry, either invertible or non-invertible, has been extensively studied in two dimensional conformal field theories in recent years. When the theory is defined on a manifold with open boundaries, however, many interesting conformal boundary conditions will fully or partially break such global symmetry. In this work, we study the effect of symmetry-breaking boundaries or interfaces when the system is out of equilibrium. We show that the boundary or interface symmetry-breaking can be detected by the time evolution of string order parameters, which are constructed from the symmetry operators that implement the symmetry transformations. While the string order parameters are independent of time if the symmetry is preserved over the whole system, they evolve in time in a universal way if the boundary or interface breaks the symmetry. More explicitly, in the presence of boundary or interface symmetry-breaking, the string order parameters decay exponentially in time after a global quantum quench, and decay as a power-law in time after a local quantum quench. We also generalize our study to the case when the string order parameters are defined in a subsystem, which are related to the full counting statistics. It is found there are also universal features in the time evolution of string order parameters in this case. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of these two different types of string order parameters in lattice models.</description>

      <title>A Lindbladian for exact renormalization of density operators in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1609.03493, the authors extended the exact renormalization group (ERG) to arbitrary wave-functionals in quantum field theory (QFT). Applying this formalism, we show that the ERG flow of density matrices is given by a Lindblad master equation. The Lindbladian consists of a "Hamiltonian" term which is the sum of a scaling and a coarse-graining (disentangling) operator, and a dissipative term with absorption and emission rates for each momentum mode. We consider as examples the flow of Gaussian states and the perturbative ground state of $\lambda \phi^4$ theory, and highlight the role of the dissipative terms in generating the correct flow of couplings. Integrating the Lindblad master equation, we find that a finite ERG flow of density matrices is described by a quantum channel. It follows from the data processing inequality that any distinguishability measure of states is an ERG monotone.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics of integrable and near-integrable atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we explore various aspects of equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for ultracold atomic gases, with a focus on the experimentally realisable one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas. This is a paradigmatic example of an interacting many-body system, which is integrable in the uniform limit and near-integrable otherwise. We first investigate a quantum thermodynamic Otto cycle driven by a quench of interaction strength of a 1D Bose gas. For the case of a sudden quench in a uniform 1D Bose gas, we demonstrate how the performance of this highly nonequilibrium quantum thermal machine may be expressed in terms of atom-atom correlations. Further, we derive a new Maxwell relation which allows one to express entropy, which is generally difficult to ascertain in quantum systems, in terms of Glauber's local second-order correlation function, which are experimentally measurable. We next perform benchmarks of GHD in order to ascertain the regimes where such a theory may be applied, and then utilize it to investigate the interaction strength-driven quantum Otto cycle in a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas. However, to realise such an engine in an experimentally realistic manner would require modelling thermalisation with external reservoirs, which is currently beyond the scope of GHD. Yet, the classical $c$-field stochastic-projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) method is capable of simulating tunnel-coupling pairs of 1D Bose gases in the weakly interacting regime. We therefore utilise this numerical method to simulate the \emph{full} quantum Otto engine cycle, realised through a single working fluid tunnel-coupled to two 1D Bose gases, which constitute the external (hot and cold) reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Typical Quantum States of the Universe are Observationally Indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the epistemology of quantum theory. We establish a new result about a limitation to knowledge of its central object -- the quantum state of the universe. We show that, if the universal quantum state can be assumed to be a typical unit vector from a high-dimensional subspace of Hilbert space (such as the subspace defined by a low-entropy macro-state as prescribed by the Past Hypothesis), then no observation can determine (or even just narrow down significantly) which vector it is. Typical state vectors, in other words, are observationally indistinguishable from each other. Our argument is based on a typicality theorem from quantum statistical mechanics. We also discuss how theoretical considerations that go beyond the empirical evidence might bear on this fact and on our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars as remnants of stable many-body periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a weak ergodicity-breaking phenomenon that defies the common scenario of thermalization in closed quantum systems. They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) -- a single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial similarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical chaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an appropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly unstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this conjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not display chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit. In contrast, chaotic dynamics are expected for initial states not associated with QMBS. Interestingly, the anomalous OTOC dynamics persist even under weak perturbations that eliminate the scarred eigenstates, suggesting a certain robustness in the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once, a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Attraction of Superparamagnetic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SMNPs), it is often claimed that the rapid thermal fluctuations of their magnetic moments negates the magnetic dipolar attraction, hence preventing aggregation in liquid suspension. However we find that this is a misconception. Using Langevin dynamics, we simulate SMNP pairs and the dimer clusters they form which is the simplest case of aggregation. To quantify the tendency to aggregate, we introduce the dimer debonding time and calculate the average magnetic force of attraction which results from correlations in the fluctuating moments. Neither quantity has any dependence on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which determines the rate of superparamagnetic reversals, and comparing with computed N\'eel relaxation times we show that this holds for both blocked and superparamagnetic particles. These results imply that the phenomenon of superparamagnetism does not affect aggregation. Because the key dimensionless parameter for the N\'eel relaxation of a lone SMNP and the one for magnetic attraction have the same size and temperature scaling, there is a strong correlation between superparamagnetism and colloidal stability, as observed experimentally, but no causal relation.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic equations for space-inhomogeneous aggregating fluids with first-principle kinetic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive from the first principles new hydrodynamic equations -- Smoluchowski-Euler equations for aggregation kinetics in space-inhomogeneous fluids with fluxes. Starting from Boltzmann equations, we obtain microscopic expressions for aggregation rates for clusters of different sizes and observe that they significantly differ from currently used phenomenological rates. Moreover, we show that for a complete description of aggregating systems, novel kinetic coefficients are needed. They share properties of transport and reaction-rate coefficients; for them we report microscopic expressions. For two representative examples -- aggregation of particles at sedimentation and aggregation after an explosion we numerically solve Smoluchowski-Euler equations and perform Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC). We find that while the new theory agrees well with DSMC results, a noticeable difference is observed for the phenomenological theory. This manifests the unreliability of the currently used phenomenological theory and the need to apply new, first-principle equations.</description>

Abstract: Predicting the future behaviour of complex systems exhibiting critical-like dynamics is often considered to be an intrinsically hard task. Here, we study the predictability of the depinning dynamics of elastic interfaces in random media driven by a slowly increasing external force, a paradigmatic complex system exhibiting critical avalanche dynamics linked to a continuous non-equilibrium depinning phase transition. To this end, we train a variety of machine learning models to infer the mapping from features of the initial relaxed line shape and the random pinning landscape to predict the sample-dependent staircase-like force-displacement curve that emerges from the depinning process. Even if for a given realization of the quenched random medium the dynamics are in principle deterministic, we find that there is an exponential decay of the predictability with the displacement of the line, quantifying how the system forgets its initial state as it nears the depinning transition from below. Our analysis on how the related displacement scale depends on the system size and the dimensionality of the input descriptor reveals that the onset of the depinning phase transition gives rise to fundamental limits to predictability.</description>

      <title>Dynamical correlation functions in the Ising field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite temperature dynamical correlation functions of the magnetization operator in the one-dimensional Ising quantum field theory. Our approach is based on a finite temperature form factor series and on a Fredholm determinant representation of the correlators. While for space-like separations the Fredholm determinant can be efficiently evaluated numerically, for the time-like region it has convergence issues inherited from the form factor series. We develop a method to compute the correlation functions at time-like separations based on the analytic continuation of the space-time coordinates to complex values. Using this numerical technique, we explore all space-time and temperature regimes in both the ordered and disordered phases including short, large, and near-light-cone separations at low and high temperatures. We confirm the existing analytic predictions for the asymptotic behavior of the correlations except in the case of space-like correlations in the paramagnetic phase. For this case we derive a new closed form expression for the correlation length that has some unusual properties: it is a non-analytic function of both the space-time direction and the temperature, and its temperature dependence is non-monotonic.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <title>Stretched-Exponential Melting of a Dynamically Frozen State Under Imprinted Phase Noise in the Ising Chain in a Transverse Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical freezing is a phenomenon where a set of local observables emerges as approximate but stable conserved quantities (freezes) under a strong periodic drive in a closed quantum system. The expectation values of these emergent conserved quantities exhibit small fluctuations around their respective initial values. These fluctuations do not grow with time, and their magnitude can be tuned down sharply by tuning the drive parameters. In this work, we probe the resilience of dynamical freezing to random perturbations added to the relative phases between the interfering states (elements of a natural basis) in the time-evolving wave function after each drive cycle. We study this in an integrable Ising chain in a time-periodic transverse field. Our key finding is, that the imprinted phase noise melts the dynamically frozen state, but the decay is "slow": a stretched-exponential decay rather than an exponential one. Stretched-exponential decays (also known as Kohlrausch relaxation) are usually expected in complex systems with time-scale hierarchies due to strong disorders or other inhomogeneities resulting in jamming, glassiness, or localization.</description>

      <title>Long-range correlations with finite-size effects from a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with power-law distributed durations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range correlations manifested as power spectral density scaling $1/f^\beta$ for frequency $f$ and a range of exponents $\beta\in[0,2]$ are investigated for a superposition of uncorrelated pulses with distributed durations $\tau$. Closed-form expressions for the frequency power spectral density are derived for a one-sided exponential pulse function and several variants of bounded and unbounded power-law distributions of pulse durations ${P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^\alpha}$ with abrupt and smooth cutoffs. The asymptotic scaling relation $\beta=3-\alpha$ is demonstrated for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3$ in the limit of an infinitely broad distribution $P_\tau(\tau)$. Logarithmic corrections to the frequency scaling are exposed at the boundaries of the long-range dependence regime, $\beta=0$ and $\beta=2$. Analytically demonstrated finite-size effects associated with distribution truncations are shown to reduce the frequency ranges of scale invariance by several decades. The regimes of validity of the $\beta=3-\alpha$ relation are clarified. The emergence of the $1/f$ noise signature is motivated for a motion of coherent structures with fixed size and uniformly distributed velocities, which are shown to be equivalent to $P_\tau(\tau)\sim1/\tau^2$ distributed durations observed from a single location.</description>

Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.</description>

      <title>The emergence of Newtonian mechanics from the inhomogeneity of an ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the observation of Max Born (M. Born 1969) that the Newton's second law can emerge from a purely statistical perspective, we derive the evolution equation about the statistical distribution for dilute gas based solely on statistical principles, without invoking Newtonian mechanics, and then obtain the equations of motion for individual particles. Newton's second law for a single particle naturally emerges when the distribution reaches equilibrium. We demonstrate that the magnitude of an external force, traditionally measured by particle acceleration, can be understood as a measure of distribution inhomogeneity. We further show that the entropic force (utilized in current gravity studies) is equivalent to the statistical force and under non-equilibrium conditions, a deviation arises between the entropic force and the Newtonian force. This framework offers a novel perspective distinct from classical Newtonian mechanics and broadens the potential scope of its application.</description>

      <title>Highly correlated two-dimensional electron fluid in best-quality GaAs quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.01035v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetotransport phenomena often provide critically important information about microscopic states and relaxation processes in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems. For example, the independence of magneto-photo-resistance of 2D electrons in best-quality quantum wells on the polarization helicity of incident radio-frequency radiation have been treated as a puzzling effect, which is important for characterization of these systems, but had no well-established explanation up to now. Here we develop a phenomenological model of dynamics of a highly correlated 2D electron fluid in moderate magnetic fields, in which the viscosity and the non-local in time contributions in inter-particle interaction are important. In this system, successive collisions of electrons joined in pairs turn out to be as important as single collisions of statistically independent electrons. The resulting photoresistance exhibits an irregular shape of magnetooscillations, the absence of the dependence on the helicity of the circular polarization of radiation, and a giant peak near the doubled cyclotron frequency. All these effects were observed in experiments on best-quality GaAs quantum wells in moderate magnetic fields at low temperatures. Although the most general conditions of applicability of the developed phenomenological model of the fluid dynamics remains unclarified now, this coincidence can point out that 2D electrons in such systems form the highly correlated viscous fluid.</description>

      <title>Stable dynamic helix state in the nonintegrable XXZ Heisenberg model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of external fields on the stability of spin helix states in an XXZ Heisenberg model. Exact diagonalization on a finite system shows that random transverse fields in the x and y directions drive the transition from integrability to nonintegrability. In such a system, the helix state can be regarded as a quantum scar. Simultaneously, the presence of uniform z field enables the helix state to better maintain its dynamical nature, allowing for a clearer understanding of its evolutionary behavior. However, the entanglement entropy reveals that irrespective of the presence of a uniform z field, as long as the system remains chaotic, the scar extent of the helix state shows no significant variation.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-Temperature Zeros for Quantum Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the zeros of complex partition functions, such as Lee-Yang zeros and Fisher zeros, have been pivotal in characterizing temperature-driven phase transitions, extending this concept to zero temperature remains an open question. In this work, we propose a solution to this issue by calculating the imaginary-temperature zeros (ITZs), which are defined as the roots of the imaginary-temperature partition function. We illustrate the analytical properties of ITZs in the transverse-field Ising chain, showing that the ITZs' distribution can distinguish between various phases and signify the critical exponents. Universal singular behaviors manifest in such quantities as the edge density of ITZs and the magnetization, with the scaling exponents remarkably differing from those in Lee-Yang theory. We further illuminate the consistency between ITZs and the zeros of the spectral form factor, which offers a practical path for the experimental detection of ITZs.</description>

Abstract: We consider an active, stochastic microscopic model of particles suspended in a fluid and show that the coarse-grained description of this model renders odd viscoelasticity. The particles are odd dumbbells, each featuring a robotic device as the bead, which exhibits a particular torque response. We show that this model can be macroscopically treated as a viscoelastic fluid, analytically calculate the coefficients of the corresponding viscoelastic model, and corroborate the results using molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides a unified analytical framework for several experimental and numerical setups designed to elucidate odd effects in fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) for single beads in linear elastic networks. In particular, the derivations of the GLEs are conducted without employing normal modes, resulting in two distinct representations in terms of resistance and mobility kernels. The fluctuation-dissipation relations are also confirmed for both GLEs. Subsequently, we demonstrate that these two representations are interconnected via Laplace transforms. Furthermore, another GLE is derived by utilizing a projection operator method, and it is shown that the equation obtained through the projection scheme is consistent with the GLE with the resistance kernel. As simple examples, the general theory is applied to the Rouse model and the ring polymer, where the GLEs with the resistance and mobility kernels are explicitly derived for arbitrary positions of the tagged bead in these models. Finally, the GLE with the mobility kernel is also derived for the elastic network with hydrodynamic interactions under the pre-averaging approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Transient subtraction: A control variate method for computing transport coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In molecular dynamics, transport coefficients measure the sensitivity of the invariant probability measure of the stochastic dynamics at hand with respect to some perturbation. They are typically computed using either the linear response of nonequilibrium dynamics, or the Green--Kubo formula. The estimators for both approaches have large variances, which motivates the study of variance reduction techniques for computing transport coefficients. We present an alternative approach, called the \emph{transient subtraction technique} (inspired by early work by Ciccotti and Jaccucci in 1975), which amounts to simulating a transient dynamics, from which we subtract a sensibly coupled equilibrium trajectory, resulting in an estimator with smaller variance. We present the mathematical formulation of the transient subtraction technique, give error estimates on the bias and variance of the associated estimator, and demonstrate the relevance of the method through numerical illustrations for various systems.</description>
