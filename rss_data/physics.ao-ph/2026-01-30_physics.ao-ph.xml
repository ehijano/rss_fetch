      <title>A Tolerance-Based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Forecast Validation Using the gamma-Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical field forecast evaluation relies mainly on local scores such as RMSE or MAE. These metrics severely over-penalize small spatial or temporal displacements of coherent structures, a limitation known as the double-penalty issue and common to many forecasting domains. The present paper introduces a tolerance-based framework built on the three-dimensional gamma index, initially designed for medical dose verification, as a unified acceptance criterion for gridded forecasts. The method embeds explicit margins in space (DTA), time (TTA), and intensity (IDT), and evaluates whether predictions agree with observations within predefined physical bounds rather than through pixel-wise differences only. A synthetic illustration is first used to show why conventional metrics can misrepresent usable forecasts. The approach is then applied to satellite-derived SSI fields to demonstrate operational behaviour on a real dataset. Results confirm that the gamma criterion preserves structural consistency under minor positional noise while isolating physically significant discrepancies. The formulation is generic and can be implemented for any gridded variable provided meaningful tolerances are defined, offering a pragmatic complement to existing spatial verification tools in general forecasting workflows.</description>

      <title>Reddy: An open-source toolbox for analyzing eddy-covariance measurements in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land-atmosphere exchange processes are determined by turbulent fluxes, which can be derived from eddy-covariance measurements. This method was established to quantify ecosystem-scale vertical atmosphere-vegetation exchange processes, but is also used to validate atmospheric turbulence theories with the ultimate aim to improve the representation of turbulence in numerical models. While the focus has long been on turbulence over idealized, homogeneous and flat surfaces, recent scientific developments are shifting towards investigating turbulent exchange processes in complex heterogeneous environments under non-idealized conditions, which pose particular challenges, e.g. advective fluxes between different surface types or non-stationarity of nighttime turbulence. This requires to rethink standard post-processing routines for determining turbulent fluxes from the high-frequency sonic and gas analyzer measurements. Here, we introduce the open-source R-package 'Reddy', which provides modular-built functions for post-processing, analysis and visualization of eddy-covariance measurements, including investigating spectra, coherent structures, anisotropy, flux footprints and surface energy balance closure. The 'Reddy' package is accompanied by a detailed documentation and a set of jupyter notebooks introducing new users hands-on to eddy-covariance data analysis. We showcase 'Reddy' based on measurements from three different sites in Norway: A case study during strong stratification over alpine tundra, for determining suitable averaging times during ice-cover transition at a boreal lake, and for fitting flux-variance relations for a permafrost peatland. 'Reddy' serves as extension of previously developed software packages, paving the way towards holistic turbulence data analysis in heterogeneous real-world environments.</description>

      <title>Rapid estimation of global sea surface temperatures from sparse streaming in situ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution sea surface temperatures (SST) from staggered SST measurements is essential for weather forecasting and climate projections. However, when SST measurements are sparse, the resulting inferred SST fields are rather inaccurate. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) to reconstruct the high-resolution SST field from sparse in situ observations, without using a model. The S-DEIM estimate consists of two terms, one computed from instantaneous in situ observations using empirical interpolation, and the other learned from the historical time series of observations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We train the RNNs using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weekly high-resolution SST dataset spanning the years 1989-2021 which constitutes the training data. Subsequently, we examine the performance of S-DEIM on the test data, comprising January 2022 to January 2023. For this test data, S-DEIM infers the high-resolution SST from 100 in situ observations, constituting only 0.2% of the high-resolution spatial grid. We show that the resulting S-DEIM reconstructions are about 40% more accurate than earlier empirical interpolation methods, such as DEIM and Q-DEIM. Furthermore, 91% of S-DEIM estimates fall within $\pm 1^\circ$C of the true SST. We also demonstrate that S-DEIM is robust with respect to sensor placement: even when the sensors are distributed randomly, S-DEIM reconstruction error deteriorates only by 1-2%. S-DEIM is also computationally efficient. Training the RNN, which is performed only once offline, takes approximately one minute. Once trained, the S-DEIM reconstructions are computed in less than a second. As such, S-DEIM can be used for rapid SST reconstruction from sparse streaming observational data in real time.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Reconstruction of Four-Dimensional Atmospheric Wind Fields Using Multi-UAS Swarm Observations in a Synthetic Turbulent Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Air-Sea Flux Parameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying air-sea fluxes is important for understanding air-sea interactions and improving coupled weather and climate systems. This study introduces a probabilistic framework to represent the highly variable nature of air-sea fluxes, which is missing in deterministic bulk algorithms. Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss. The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates. Stochastic parameterization of air-sea turbulent fluxes can be constructed by sampling from the predicted distributions. Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally. The ensemble spread in stochastic runs is most pronounced during spring restratification.</description>

      <title>Ocean neutral transport: sub-Riemannian geometry and hypoelliptic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport and mixing of tracers in the ocean is thought to be preferentially along neutral planes defined by the potential temperature and salinity fields. This gives rise to a conceptual model of ocean transport in which water parcel trajectories are everywhere neutral, that is, tangent to the neutral planes. Because the distribution of neutral planes is not integrable, neutral transport, while locally two dimensional, is globally three dimensional. We describe this form of transport, building on its connection with contact and sub-Riemannian geometry.
  We discuss a Lie-bracket interpretation of local dianeutral transport, the quantitative meaning of helicity and the implications of the accessibility theorem. We compute sub-Riemnanian geodesics for climatological neutral planes and put forward the use of the associated Carnot--Carath\'eodory distance as a diagnostic of the strong anisotropy of neutral transport.
  We propose a stochastic toy model of neutral transport which represents motion along neutral planes by a Brownian motion. The corresponding diffusion process is degenerate and not (strongly) elliptic. The non-integrability of the neutral planes however ensures that the diffusion is hypoelliptic. As a result, trajectories are not confined to surfaces but visit the entire three-dimensional ocean. The short-time behaviour is qualitatively different from that obtained with a non-degenerate highly anisotropic diffusion. We examine both short- and long-time behaviours using Monte Carlo simulations. The simulations provide an estimate for the time scale of ocean vertical transport implied by the constraint of neutrality.</description>

      <title>Multi-threshold time series analysis enables characterization of variable renewable energy droughts in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variable renewable energy droughts, so called Dunkelflaute events, emerge as a challenge for climate-neutral energy systems based on variable renewables. Here we characterize European drought events for on- and offshore wind power, solar photovoltaics, and renewable technology portfolios, using 38 historic weather years and an advanced identification method. Their characteristics heavily depend on the chosen drought threshold, questioning the usefulness of single-threshold analyses. Applying a multi-threshold framework, we quantify how the complementarity of wind and solar power temporally and spatially alleviates drought frequency, return periods, duration, and severity within (portfolio effect) and across countries (balancing effect). We identify the most extreme droughts, which drive major discharging periods of long-duration storage in a fully renewable European energy system, based on a policy-relevant decarbonization scenario. Such events comprise sequences of shorter droughts of varying severity. The most extreme event occurred in winter 1996/97 and lasted 55 days in an idealized, perfectly interconnected setting. The average renewable availability during this period was still 47% of its long-run mean. System planners must consider such events when planning for storage and other flexibility technologies. Methodologically, we conclude that using arbitrary single calendar years is not suitable for modeling weather-resilient energy scenarios.</description>
