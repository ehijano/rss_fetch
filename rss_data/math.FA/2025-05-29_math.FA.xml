      <title>Sampling Finite Unit Norm Tight Frames Using Symplectic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit-norm tight frames in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (FUNTFs) are fundamental in signal processing, offering optimal robustness to noise and measurement loss. In this paper we introduce the Eigenlift algorithm for sampling random FUNTFs. Our approach exploits the symplectic geometry of the FUNTF space, which we characterize as a symplectic reduction of frame space by a symmetry group. We then define a Hamiltonian torus action on this reduced space whose momentum map induces a fiber bundle structure. The algorithm proceeds by sampling a point from the base space, which is a convex polytope, lifting it deterministically to a point on the corresponding fiber, then acting on this point by a random element of the torus to obtain a random FUNTF. We implement the method in Python and validate it in low-dimensional settings where it is computationally feasible to sample the base polytope via rejection sampling.</description>

      <title>On the discrete Hilbert-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bansah and Sehba studied in [3] the boundedness of a family of Hilbert-type integral operators, in which they characterized the $L^{p}-L^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. In this paper, we deal with the corresponding discrete Hilbert-type operators acting on the weighted sequence spaces. We establish some sufficient and necessary conditions for the $l^{p}-l^{q}$ boundedness of the operators for $1\leq p\leq q\leq \infty$. We find out that the conditions of the boundedness of discrete Hilbert-type operators are different from those of the boundedness of Hilbert-type integral operators. Also, for some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for discrete Hilbert-type operators.</description>

      <title>On generalized limits and ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$, we denote by $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ the family of positive normalized linear functionals on $\ell_\infty$ which assign value $0$ to all characteristic sequences of sets in $\mathcal{I}$. We show that every element of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ is a Choquet average of certain ultrafilter limit functionals. Also, we prove that the diameter of $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ is $2$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is not maximal, and that the latter claim can be considerably strengthened if $\mathcal{I}$ is meager. Lastly, we provide several applications: for instance, recovering a result of Freedman in [Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 13 (1981), 224--228], we show that the family of bounded sequences for which all functionals in $\mathrm{SL}(\mathcal{I})$ assign the same value coincides with the closed vector space of bounded $\mathcal{I}$-convergent sequences.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of compactness on variable $L^{p(\cdot)}$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on a recent approach of Hyt\"onen-Lappas to the extrapolation of compactness of linear operators on weighted $L^p(w)$ spaces, we extend these results to the weighted variable-exponent spaces $L^{p(\cdot)}(w)$. Related results are recently due to Lorist-Nieraeth, who showed that compactness can be extrapolated from $L^p(w)$ to a general class of Banach function spaces including the $L^{p(\cdot)}(w)$ spaces. The novelty of our result is that one can take any variable-exponent $L^{p(\cdot)}(w)$, not just $L^p(w)$, as a starting point of extrapolation. An application of our extrapolation to commutators $[b,T]$ of pointwise multipliers and singular integrals allows us to complete a set of implications, showing that $b\in CMO(\mathbb{R}^d)$ is not only sufficient (as known from Lorist-Nieraeth) but also necessary for the compactness of $[b,T]$ on any fixed $L^{p(\cdot)}(w)$.</description>

      <title>Extensions of homogeneous distributions on deformations to the normal cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a deformation to the normal cone $\operatorname{DNC}(M,V)$ we show that given a distribution $u\in\mathcal{D}'(\operatorname{DNC}(M,V)\setminus V\times\mathbb{R})$ if $u$ is homogeneous of order $a$ for the zoom action, then it admits an $a$-homogeneous extension $\widetilde{u}\in\mathcal{D}'(\operatorname{DNC}(M,V))$. We describe all such extensions and discuss briefly about how it translates to the work of Van Erp and Yuncken in arXiv:2303.15787 . The technique used come from the results on the extension of weakly homogeneous distributions provided by Yves Meyer in the 90s.</description>

      <title>Random Field Representations of Kernel Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positive semi-definite kernels are used to induce pseudo-metrics, or ``distances'', between measures. We write these as an expected quadratic variation of, or expected inner product between, a random field and the difference of measures. This alternate viewpoint offers important intuition and interesting connections to existing forms. Metric distances leading to convenient finite sample estimates are shown to be induced by fields with dense support, stationary increments, and scale invariance. The main example of this is energy distance. We show that the common generalization preserving continuity is induced by fractional Brownian motion. We induce an alternate generalization with the Gaussian free field, formally extending the Cram\'er-von Mises distance. Pathwise properties give intuition about practical aspects of each. This is demonstrated through signal to noise ratio studies.</description>

      <title>Brunn-Minkowski and Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Dual Quermassintegrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes two new geometric inequalities in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. The first, originally conjectured by Lutwak, is the Brunn-Minkowski inequality for dual quermassintegrals of origin-symmetric convex bodies. The second, generalizing Ball's volume ratio inequality, is a reverse isoperimetric inequality: among all origin-symmetric convex bodies in John's position, the cube maximizes the dual quermassintegrals.</description>

      <title>A $2$-dimensional real Banach space with constant of analyticity less than one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that on the real $2$-dimensional Banach space $\ell_1^2$ there is an analytic function $f:B_{\ell_1^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that its power series at origin has radius of uniform convergence one, but for some $a\in B_{\ell_1^2}$ the power series centred at that point has radius of uniform convergence strictly less than $1-\|a\|$. This result highlights a fundamental distinction in real analytic functions (compared to complex analytic functions), where the radius of analyticity can differ from the radius of uniform convergence. Moreover, this example provides the first non-trivial upper bound for the constant of analyticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object in group theory. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer representations of $O_n$. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the odometer lifting and subrepresentations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of absolutely continuous functions with values in an infinite-dimensional manifold and regularity properties of half-Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in [1,\infty]$, we define a smooth manifold structure on the set $AC_{L^p}([a,b],N)$ of absolutely continuous functions $\gamma\colon [a,b]\to N$ with $L^p$-derivatives for all real numbers $a&lt;b$ and each smooth manifold $N$ modeled on a sequentially complete locally convex topological vector space, such that $N$ admits a local addition. Smoothness of natural mappings between spaces of absolutely continuous functions is discussed, like superposition operators $AC_{L^p}([a,b],N_1)\to AC_{L^p}([a,b],N_2)$, $\eta\mapsto f\circ \eta$, for a smooth map $f\colon N_1\to N_2$. For $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $r\in \mathbb{N}$ we show that the right half-Lie groups $\text{Diff}_K^r(\mathbb{R})$ and $\text{Diff}^r(M)$ are $L^p$-semiregular. Here $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $M$ is a compact smooth manifold. An $L^p$-semiregular half-Lie group $G$ admits an evolution map $\text{Evol}:L^p([0,1],T_e G)\to AC_{L^p}([0,1],G)$, where $e$ is the neutral element of $G$. For the preceding examples, the evolution map $\text{Evol}$ is continuous.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, by introducing some parameters, we define and study certain $p$-adic Hardy-Littlewood-P\'{o}lya-type integral operators acting on $p$-adic weighted Lebesgue spaces. We completely characterize the boundedness of these operators in terms of the parameters. For some special cases, we obtain sharp norm estimates for the operators. These results are not only a complement to some previous results but also an extension of existing ones in the literature.</description>

      <title>Geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on simple surfaces or on spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The X-ray transform on the plane or on the three-dimensional Euclidean space can be considered as the measurements of CT scanners for normal human tissue. If the human body contains metal regions such as dental implants, stents in blood vessels, metal bones, etc., the beam hardening effect for the energy level of the X-ray causes streaking artifacts in its CT image. More precisely, if there are two strictly convex metal regions contained in the cross-section of normal human tissue, then streaking artifacts occur along the common tangent lines of the two regions. In this paper we study the geodesic X-ray transform and streaking artifacts on nontrapping simple compact Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundaries. We show that the streaking artifacts result from the propagation of conormal singularities on the boundary of metal regions along the common tangent geodesics under the strong and seemingly strange assumption that the manifolds are two dimensional or spaces of constant curvature. This condition ensures that every Jacobi field takes the form of the product of a scalar function and parallel transport along the geodesic. Our results clarify the geometric meaning of the theory, which was imperceptible in the known results on the Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'e inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in \textit{any} normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'e constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'e constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call \emph{long range expansion}, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends \emph{polynomially} on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space with an unconditional basis which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>New results related to cutters and to an extrapolated block-iterative method for finding a common fixed point of a collection of them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a Hilbert space and a finite family of operators defined on the space, the common fixed point problem (CFPP) is to find a point in the intersection of the fixed point sets of these operators. Instances of the problem have numerous applications in science and engineering. We consider an extrapolated block-iterative method with dynamic weights for solving the CFPP assuming the operators belong to a wide class of operators called cutters. Global convergence is proved in two different scenarios, one of them is under a seemingly new condition on the weights which is less restrictive than a condition suggested in previous works. In order to establish convergence, we derive various new results of independent interest related to cutters, some of them extend, generalize and clarify previously published results.</description>
