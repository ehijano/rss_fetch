      <title>Agnostic Private Density Estimation via Stable List Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of stability--which we call stable list decoding--and demonstrate its applicability in designing differentially private density estimators. This definition is weaker than global stability [ABLMM22] and is related to the notions of replicability [ILPS22] and list replicability [CMY23]. We show that if a class of distributions is stable list decodable, then it can be learned privately in the agnostic setting. As the main application of our framework, we prove the first upper bound on the sample complexity of private density estimation for Gaussian Mixture Models in the agnostic setting, extending the realizable result of Afzali et al. [AAL24].</description>

      <title>Training Guarantees of Neural Network Classification Two-Sample Tests by Kernel Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a neural network two-sample test to determine whether two datasets came from the same distribution (null hypothesis) or not (alternative hypothesis). We perform time-analysis on a neural tangent kernel (NTK) two-sample test. In particular, we derive the theoretical minimum training time needed to ensure the NTK two-sample test detects a deviation-level between the datasets. Similarly, we derive the theoretical maximum training time before the NTK two-sample test detects a deviation-level. By approximating the neural network dynamics with the NTK dynamics, we extend this time-analysis to the realistic neural network two-sample test generated from time-varying training dynamics and finite training samples. A similar extension is done for the neural network two-sample test generated from time-varying training dynamics but trained on the population. To give statistical guarantees, we show that the statistical power associated with the neural network two-sample test goes to 1 as the neural network training samples and test evaluation samples go to infinity. Additionally, we prove that the training times needed to detect the same deviation-level in the null and alternative hypothesis scenarios are well-separated. Finally, we run some experiments showcasing a two-layer neural network two-sample test on a hard two-sample test problem and plot a heatmap of the statistical power of the two-sample test in relation to training time and network complexity.</description>

      <title>On high-dimensional modifications of the nearest neighbor classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor classifier is arguably the most simple and popular nonparametric classifier available in the literature. However, due to the concentration of pairwise distances and the violation of the neighborhood structure, this classifier often suffers in high-dimension, low-sample size (HDLSS) situations, especially when the scale difference between the competing classes dominates their location difference. Several attempts have been made in the literature to take care of this problem. In this article, we discuss some of these existing methods and propose some new ones. We carry out some theoretical investigations in this regard and analyze several simulated and benchmark datasets to compare the empirical performances of proposed methods with some of the existing ones.</description>

      <title>How DNNs break the Curse of Dimensionality: Compositionality and Symmetry Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently learn any composition of functions with bounded $F_{1}$-norm, which allows DNNs to break the curse of dimensionality in ways that shallow networks cannot. More specifically, we derive a generalization bound that combines a covering number argument for compositionality, and the $F_{1}$-norm (or the related Barron norm) for large width adaptivity. We show that the global minimizer of the regularized loss of DNNs can fit for example the composition of two functions $f^{*}=h\circ g$ from a small number of observations, assuming $g$ is smooth/regular and reduces the dimensionality (e.g. $g$ could be the modulo map of the symmetries of $f^{*}$), so that $h$ can be learned in spite of its low regularity. The measures of regularity we consider is the Sobolev norm with different levels of differentiability, which is well adapted to the $F_{1}$ norm. We compute scaling laws empirically and observe phase transitions depending on whether $g$ or $h$ is harder to learn, as predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Benchmarking for Causal Structure Learning in Gene Perturbation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal structure learning (CSL) refers to the task of learning causal relationships from data. Advances in CSL now allow learning of causal graphs in diverse application domains, which has the potential to facilitate data-driven causal decision-making. Real-world CSL performance depends on a number of $\textit{context-specific}$ factors, including context-specific data distributions and non-linear dependencies, that are important in practical use-cases. However, our understanding of how to assess and select CSL methods in specific contexts remains limited. To address this gap, we present $\textit{CausalRegNet}$, a multiplicative effect structural causal model that allows for generating observational and interventional data incorporating context-specific properties, with a focus on the setting of gene perturbation experiments. Using real-world gene perturbation data, we show that CausalRegNet generates accurate distributions and scales far better than current simulation frameworks. We illustrate the use of CausalRegNet in assessing CSL methods in the context of interventional experiments in biology.</description>

      <title>A Likelihood-Based Generative Approach for Spatially Consistent Precipitation Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for precipitation downscaling. However, current models rely on likelihood-based loss functions to properly model the precipitation distribution, leading to spatially inconsistent projections when sampling. This work explores a novel approach by fusing the strengths of likelihood-based and adversarial losses used in generative models. As a result, we propose a likelihood-based generative approach for precipitation downscaling, leveraging the benefits of both methods.</description>

      <title>RPN: Reconciled Polynomial Network Towards Unifying PGMs, Kernel SVMs, MLP and KAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce a novel deep model named Reconciled Polynomial Network (RPN) for deep function learning. RPN has a very general architecture and can be used to build models with various complexities, capacities, and levels of completeness, which all contribute to the correctness of these models. As indicated in the subtitle, RPN can also serve as the backbone to unify different base models into one canonical representation. This includes non-deep models, like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) - such as Bayesian network and Markov network - and kernel support vector machines (kernel SVMs), as well as deep models like the classic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN).
  Technically, RPN proposes to disentangle the underlying function to be inferred into the inner product of a data expansion function and a parameter reconciliation function. Together with the remainder function, RPN accurately approximates the underlying functions that governs data distributions. The data expansion functions in RPN project data vectors from the input space to a high-dimensional intermediate space, specified by the expansion functions in definition. Meanwhile, RPN also introduces the parameter reconciliation functions to fabricate a small number of parameters into a higher-order parameter matrix to address the ``curse of dimensionality'' problem caused by the data expansions. Moreover, the remainder functions provide RPN with additional complementary information to reduce potential approximation errors. We conducted extensive empirical experiments on numerous benchmark datasets across multiple modalities, including continuous function datasets, discrete vision and language datasets, and classic tabular datasets, to investigate the effectiveness of RPN.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and proof an explicit representation of the Radon-Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, which results in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints.
  Two deep learning algorithms are proposed to find the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with a extended application to combine implied volatility smiles models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>Idiographic Personality Gaussian Process for Psychological Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel measurement framework based on a Gaussian process coregionalization model to address a long-lasting debate in psychometrics: whether psychological features like personality share a common structure across the population, vary uniquely for individuals, or some combination. We propose the idiographic personality Gaussian process (IPGP) framework, an intermediate model that accommodates both shared trait structure across a population and "idiographic" deviations for individuals. IPGP leverages the Gaussian process coregionalization model to handle the grouped nature of battery responses, but adjusted to non-Gaussian ordinal data. We further exploit stochastic variational inference for efficient latent factor estimation required for idiographic modeling at scale. Using synthetic and real data, we show that IPGP improves both prediction of actual responses and estimation of individualized factor structures relative to existing benchmarks. In a third study, we show that IPGP also identifies unique clusters of personality taxonomies in real-world data, displaying great potential in advancing individualized approaches to psychological diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>DMTG: One-Shot Differentiable Multi-Task Grouping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to address Multi-Task Learning (MTL) with a large number of tasks by Multi-Task Grouping (MTG). Given N tasks, we propose to simultaneously identify the best task groups from 2^N candidates and train the model weights simultaneously in one-shot, with the high-order task-affinity fully exploited. This is distinct from the pioneering methods which sequentially identify the groups and train the model weights, where the group identification often relies on heuristics. As a result, our method not only improves the training efficiency, but also mitigates the objective bias introduced by the sequential procedures that potentially lead to a suboptimal solution. Specifically, we formulate MTG as a fully differentiable pruning problem on an adaptive network architecture determined by an underlying Categorical distribution. To categorize N tasks into K groups (represented by K encoder branches), we initially set up KN task heads, where each branch connects to all N task heads to exploit the high-order task-affinity. Then, we gradually prune the KN heads down to N by learning a relaxed differentiable Categorical distribution, ensuring that each task is exclusively and uniquely categorized into only one branch. Extensive experiments on CelebA and Taskonomy datasets with detailed ablations show the promising performance and efficiency of our method. The codes are available at https://github.com/ethanygao/DMTG.</description>

      <title>The Role of Depth, Width, and Tree Size in Expressiveness of Deep Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random forests are classical ensemble algorithms that construct multiple randomized decision trees and aggregate their predictions using naive averaging. \citet{zhou2019deep} further propose a deep forest algorithm with multi-layer forests, which outperforms random forests in various tasks. The performance of deep forests is related to three hyperparameters in practice: depth, width, and tree size, but little has been known about its theoretical explanation. This work provides the first upper and lower bounds on the approximation complexity of deep forests concerning the three hyperparameters. Our results confirm the distinctive role of depth, which can exponentially enhance the expressiveness of deep forests compared with width and tree size. Experiments confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Privacy of the last iterate in cyclically-sampled DP-SGD on nonconvex composite losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) refers to a family of optimization algorithms that provide a guaranteed level of differential privacy (DP) through DP accounting techniques. However, current accounting techniques make assumptions that diverge significantly from practical DP-SGD implementations. For example, they may assume the loss function is Lipschitz continuous and convex, sample the batches randomly with replacement, or omit the gradient clipping step.
  In this work, we analyze the most commonly used variant of DP-SGD, in which we sample batches cyclically with replacement, perform gradient clipping, and only release the last DP-SGD iterate. More specifically - without assuming convexity, smoothness, or Lipschitz continuity of the loss function - we establish new R\'enyi differential privacy (RDP) bounds for the last DP-SGD iterate under the mild assumption that (i) the DP-SGD stepsize is small relative to the topological constants in the loss function, and (ii) the loss function is weakly-convex. Moreover, we show that our bounds converge to previously established convex bounds when the weak-convexity parameter of the objective function approaches zero. In the case of non-Lipschitz smooth loss functions, we provide a weaker bound that scales well in terms of the number of DP-SGD iterations.</description>

      <title>Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convex programming plays a fundamental role in machine learning, data science, and engineering. Testing convexity structure in nonlinear programs relies on verifying the convexity of objectives and constraints. \citet{grant2006disciplined} introduced a framework, Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP), for automating this verification task for a wide range of convex functions that can be decomposed into basic convex functions (atoms) using convexity-preserving compositions and transformations (rules). However, the restriction to Euclidean convexity concepts can limit the applicability of the framework. For instance, many notable instances of statistical estimators and matrix-valued (sub)routines in machine learning applications are Euclidean non-convex, but exhibit geodesic convexity through a more general Riemannian lens. In this work, we extend disciplined programming to this setting by introducing Disciplined Geodesically Convex Programming (DGCP). We determine convexity-preserving compositions and transformations for geodesically convex functions on general Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, as well as for the special case of symmetric positive definite matrices, a common setting in matrix-valued optimization. For the latter, we also define a basic set of atoms. Our paper is accompanied by a Julia package SymbolicAnalysis.jl, which provides functionality for testing and certifying DGCP-compliant expressions. Our library interfaces with manifold optimization software, which allows for directly solving verified geodesically convex programs.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic meta-learners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) over time is crucial in many disciplines such as personalized medicine. For example, electronic health records are commonly collected over several time periods and then used to personalize treatment decisions. Existing works for this task have mostly focused on model-based learners (i.e., learners that adapt specific machine-learning models). In contrast, model-agnostic learners -- so-called meta-learners -- are largely unexplored. In our paper, we propose several meta-learners that are model-agnostic and thus can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., transformers) to estimate HTEs over time. Here, our focus is on learners that can be obtained via weighted pseudo-outcome regressions, which allows for efficient estimation by targeting the treatment effect directly. We then provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the different learners and that allows us to offer insights into when specific learners are preferable. Finally, we confirm our theoretical insights through numerical experiments. In sum, while meta-learners are already state-of-the-art for the static setting, we are the first to propose a comprehensive set of meta-learners for estimating HTEs in the time-varying setting.</description>

Abstract: Irregular and asynchronous event sequences are prevalent in many domains, such as social media, finance, and healthcare. Traditional temporal point processes (TPPs), like Hawkes processes, often struggle to model mutual inhibition and nonlinearity effectively. While recent neural network models, including RNNs and Transformers, address some of these issues, they still face challenges with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Mamba Hawkes Process (MHP), which leverages the Mamba state space architecture to capture long-range dependencies and dynamic event interactions. Our results show that MHP outperforms existing models across various datasets. Additionally, we propose the Mamba Hawkes Process Extension (MHP-E), which combines Mamba and Transformer models to enhance predictive capabilities. We present the novel application of the Mamba architecture to Hawkes processes, a flexible and extensible model structure, and a theoretical analysis of the synergy between state space models and Hawkes processes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of both MHP and MHP-E, advancing the field of temporal point process modeling.</description>

      <title>Harmony in Diversity: Merging Neural Networks with Canonical Correlation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining the predictions of multiple trained models through ensembling is generally a good way to improve accuracy by leveraging the different learned features of the models, however it comes with high computational and storage costs. Model fusion, the act of merging multiple models into one by combining their parameters reduces these costs but doesn't work as well in practice. Indeed, neural network loss landscapes are high-dimensional and non-convex and the minima found through learning are typically separated by high loss barriers. Numerous recent works have been focused on finding permutations matching one network features to the features of a second one, lowering the loss barrier on the linear path between them in parameter space. However, permutations are restrictive since they assume a one-to-one mapping between the different models' neurons exists. We propose a new model merging algorithm, CCA Merge, which is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis and aims to maximize the correlations between linear combinations of the model features. We show that our alignment method leads to better performances than past methods when averaging models trained on the same, or differing data splits. We also extend this analysis into the harder setting where more than 2 models are merged, and we find that CCA Merge works significantly better than past methods.

      <title>A Fair Post-Processing Method based on the MADD Metric for Predictive Student Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive student models are increasingly used in learning environments. However, due to the rising social impact of their usage, it is now all the more important for these models to be both sufficiently accurate and fair in their predictions. To evaluate algorithmic fairness, a new metric has been developed in education, namely the Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD). This metric enables us to measure how different a predictive model behaves regarding two groups of students, in order to quantify its algorithmic unfairness. In this paper, we thus develop a post-processing method based on this metric, that aims at improving the fairness while preserving the accuracy of relevant predictive models' results. We experiment with our approach on the task of predicting student success in an online course, using both simulated and real-world educational data, and obtain successful results. Our source code and data are in open access at https://github.com/melinaverger/MADD .</description>

Abstract: We critically review three major theories of machine learning and provide a new theory according to which machines learn a function when the machines successfully compute it. We show that this theory challenges common assumptions in the statistical and the computational learning theories, for it implies that learning true probabilities is equivalent neither to obtaining a correct calculation of the true probabilities nor to obtaining an almost-sure convergence to them. We also briefly discuss some case studies from natural language processing and macroeconomics from the perspective of the new theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When there exists uncertainty, AI machines are designed to make decisions so as to reach the best expected outcomes. Expectations are based on true facts about the objective environment the machines interact with, and those facts can be encoded into AI models in the form of true objective probability functions. Accordingly, AI models involve probabilistic machine learning in which the probabilities should be objectively interpreted. We prove under some basic assumptions when machines can learn the true objective probabilities, if any, and when machines cannot learn them.</description>

      <title>A Re-solving Heuristic for Dynamic Assortment Optimization with Knapsack Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a multi-stage dynamic assortment optimization problem with multi-nomial choice modeling (MNL) under resource knapsack constraints. Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an assortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize the total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment solution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt the re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear programs (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional structure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization highly non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this challenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively transforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint. Theoretically, we prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the optimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the length of time horizon and resource capacities.</description>

      <title>Fractional Budget Allocation for Influence Maximization under General Marketing Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the fractional influence maximization problem, i.e., identifying users on a social network to be incentivized with potentially partial discounts to maximize the influence on the network. The larger the discount given to a user, the higher the likelihood of its activation (adopting a new product or innovation), who then attempts to activate its neighboring users, causing a cascade effect of influence through the network. Our goal is to devise efficient algorithms that assign initial discounts to the network's users to maximize the total number of activated users at the end of the cascade, subject to a constraint on the total sum of discounts given. In general, the activation likelihood could be any non-decreasing function of the discount, whereas, our focus lies on the case when the activation likelihood is an affine function of the discount, potentially varying across different users. As this problem is shown to be NP-hard, we propose and analyze an efficient (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we run experiments on real-world social networks to show the performance and scalability of our method.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet process mixture model based on topologically augmented signal representation for clustering infant vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on audio recordings made once a month during the first 12 months of a child's life, we propose a new method for clustering this set of vocalizations. We use a topologically augmented representation of the vocalizations, employing two persistence diagrams for each vocalization: one computed on the surface of its spectrogram and one on the Takens' embeddings of the vocalization. A synthetic persistent variable is derived for each diagram and added to the MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients). Using this representation, we fit a non-parametric Bayesian mixture model with a Dirichlet process prior to model the number of components. This procedure leads to a novel data-driven categorization of vocal productions. Our findings reveal the presence of 8 clusters of vocalizations, allowing us to compare their temporal distribution and acoustic profiles in the first 12 months of life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and analyses interacting underdamped Langevin algorithms, termed Kinetic Interacting Particle Langevin Monte Carlo (KIPLMC) methods, for statistical inference in latent variable models. We propose a diffusion process that evolves jointly in the space of parameters and latent variables and exploit the fact that the stationary distribution of this diffusion concentrates around the maximum marginal likelihood estimate of the parameters. We then provide two explicit discretisations of this diffusion as practical algorithms to estimate parameters of statistical models. For each algorithm, we obtain nonasymptotic rates of convergence for the case where the joint log-likelihood is strongly concave with respect to latent variables and parameters. In particular, we provide convergence analysis for the diffusion together with the discretisation error, providing convergence rate estimates for the algorithms in Wasserstein-2 distance. To demonstrate the utility of the introduced methodology, we provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diffusion for statistical inference and the stability of the numerical integrators utilised for discretisation. Our setting covers a broad number of applications, including unsupervised learning, statistical inference, and inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Link Representation Learning for Probabilistic Travel Time Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Travel time estimation is a crucial application in navigation apps and web mapping services. Current deterministic and probabilistic methods primarily focus on modeling individual trips, assuming independence among trips. However, in real-world scenarios, we often observe strong inter-trip correlations due to factors such as weather conditions, traffic management, and road works. In this paper, we propose to model trip-level link travel time using a Gaussian hierarchical model, which can characterize both inter-trip and intra-trip correlations. The joint distribution of travel time of multiple trips becomes a multivariate Gaussian parameterized by learnable link representations. To effectively use the sparse GPS trajectories, we also propose a data augmentation method based on trip sub-sampling, which allows for fine-grained gradient backpropagation in learning link representations. During inference, we estimate the probability distribution of the travel time of a queried trip conditional on the completed trips that are spatiotemporally adjacent. We refer to the overall framework as ProbTTE. We evaluate ProbTTE on two real-world GPS trajectory datasets, and the results demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic baselines. Additionally, we find that the learned link representations align well with the physical geometry of the network, making them suitable as input for other applications.</description>

      <title>Sketchy Moment Matching: Toward Fast and Provable Data Selection for Finetuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit data selection in a modern context of finetuning from a fundamental perspective. Extending the classical wisdom of variance minimization in low dimensions to high-dimensional finetuning, our generalization analysis unveils the importance of additionally reducing bias induced by low-rank approximation. Inspired by the variance-bias tradeoff in high dimensions from the theory, we introduce Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM), a scalable data selection scheme with two stages. (i) First, the bias is controlled using gradient sketching that explores the finetuning parameter space for an informative low-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{S}$; (ii) then the variance is reduced over $\mathcal{S}$ via moment matching between the original and selected datasets. Theoretically, we show that gradient sketching is fast and provably accurate: selecting $n$ samples by reducing variance over $\mathcal{S}$ preserves the fast-rate generalization $O(\dim(\mathcal{S})/n)$, independent of the parameter dimension. Empirically, we concretize the variance-bias balance via synthetic experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of SkMM for finetuning in real vision tasks.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian geoacoustic inversion problems are conventionally solved by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods or its variants, which are computationally expensive. This paper extends the classic Bayesian geoacoustic inversion framework by deriving important geoacoustic statistics of Bayesian geoacoustic inversion from the multidimensional posterior probability density (PPD) using the mixture density network (MDN) theory. These statistics make it convenient to train the network directly on the whole parameter space and get the multidimensional PPD of model parameters. The present approach provides a much more efficient way to solve geoacoustic inversion problems in Bayesian inference framework. The network is trained on a simulated dataset of surface-wave dispersion curves with shear-wave velocities as labels and tested on both synthetic and real data cases. The results show that the network gives reliable predictions and has good generalization performance on unseen data. Once trained, the network can rapidly (within seconds) give a fully probabilistic solution which is comparable to Monte Carlo methods. It provides an promising approach for real-time inversion.</description>

Abstract: In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, fermentation processes play a critical role in productivity and profit. A fermentation process uses living cells with complex biological mechanisms, leading to high variability in the process outputs, namely, the protein and impurity levels. By building on the biological mechanisms of protein and impurity growth, we introduce a stochastic model to characterize the accumulation of the protein and impurity levels in the fermentation process. However, a common challenge in the industry is the availability of only a very limited amount of data, especially in the development and early stages of production. This adds an additional layer of uncertainty, referred to as model risk, due to the difficulty of estimating the model parameters with limited data. In this paper, we study the harvesting decision for a fermentation process (i.e., when to stop the fermentation and collect the production reward) under model risk. We adopt a Bayesian approach to update the unknown parameters of the growth-rate distributions, and use the resulting posterior distributions to characterize the impact of model risk on fermentation output variability. The harvesting problem is formulated as a Markov decision process model with knowledge states that summarize the posterior distributions and hence incorporate the model risk in decision-making. Our case studies at MSD Animal Health demonstrate that the proposed model and solution approach improve the harvesting decisions in real life by achieving substantially higher average output from a fermentation batch along with lower batch-to-batch variability.</description>

      <title>Prominent Roles of Conditionally Invariant Components in Domain Adaptation: Theory and Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) is a statistical learning problem that arises when the distribution of the source data used to train a model differs from that of the target data used to evaluate the model. While many DA algorithms have demonstrated considerable empirical success, blindly applying these algorithms can often lead to worse performance on new datasets. To address this, it is crucial to clarify the assumptions under which a DA algorithm has good target performance. In this work, we focus on the assumption of the presence of conditionally invariant components (CICs), which are relevant for prediction and remain conditionally invariant across the source and target data. We demonstrate that CICs, which can be estimated through conditional invariant penalty (CIP), play three prominent roles in providing target risk guarantees in DA. First, we propose a new algorithm based on CICs, importance-weighted conditional invariant penalty (IW-CIP), which has target risk guarantees beyond simple settings such as covariate shift and label shift. Second, we show that CICs help identify large discrepancies between source and target risks of other DA algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate that incorporating CICs into the domain invariant projection (DIP) algorithm can address its failure scenario caused by label-flipping features. We support our new algorithms and theoretical findings via numerical experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, CelebA, Camelyon17, and DomainNet datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonparametric density models are of great interest in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Classical density kernel methods, while numerically robust and statistically sound in low-dimensional settings, become inadequate even in moderate higher-dimensional settings due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS), specifically designed to estimate multivariable density functions with a reduced curse of dimensionality. Our framework conceptualizes multivariable functions as infinite-size matrices, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in density estimation problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network estimators and classical kernel methods in numerous density models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to support its ability to deliver nonparametric density estimation with a reduced curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity for various graph-related tasks. However, similar to deep neural networks, GNNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Empirical studies have shown that adversarially robust generalization has a pivotal role in establishing effective defense algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we contribute by providing adversarially robust generalization bounds for two kinds of popular GNNs, graph convolutional network (GCN) and message passing graph neural network, using the PAC-Bayesian framework. Our result reveals that spectral norm of the diffusion matrix on the graph and spectral norm of the weights as well as the perturbation factor govern the robust generalization bounds of both models. Our bounds are nontrivial generalizations of the results developed in (Liao et al., 2020) from the standard setting to adversarial setting while avoiding exponential dependence of the maximum node degree. As corollaries, we derive better PAC-Bayesian robust generalization bounds for GCN in the standard setting, which improve the bounds in (Liao et al., 2020) by avoiding exponential dependence on the maximum node degree.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Diffusion Bridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method for generating new synthetic samples that are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from high-dimensional real-valued probability distributions, as defined implicitly by a set of Ground Truth (GT) samples. Central to our method is the integration of space-time mixing strategies that extend across temporal and spatial dimensions. Our methodology is underpinned by three interrelated stochastic processes designed to enable optimal transport from an easily tractable initial probability distribution to the target distribution represented by the GT samples: (a) linear processes incorporating space-time mixing that yield Gaussian conditional probability densities, (b) their diffusion bridge analogs that are conditioned to the initial and final state vectors, and (c) nonlinear stochastic processes refined through score-matching techniques. The crux of our training regime involves fine-tuning the nonlinear model, and potentially the linear models -- to align closely with the GT data. We validate the efficacy of our space-time diffusion approach with numerical experiments, laying the groundwork for more extensive future theory and experiments to fully authenticate the method, particularly providing a more efficient (possibly simulation-free) inference.</description>

      <title>VC Theory for Inventory Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in computational power and AI have increased interest in reinforcement learning approaches to inventory management. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for these approaches and investigates the benefits of restricting to policy structures that are well-established by inventory theory. In particular, we prove generalization guarantees for learning several well-known classes of inventory policies, including base-stock and (s, S) policies, by leveraging the celebrated Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. We apply the Pseudo-dimension and Fat-shattering dimension from VC theory to determine the generalization error of inventory policies, that is, the difference between an inventory policy's performance on training data and its expected performance on unseen data. We focus on a classical setting without contexts, but allow for an arbitrary distribution over demand sequences and do not make any assumptions such as independence over time. We corroborate our supervised learning results using numerical simulations.
  Managerially, our theory and simulations translate to the following insights. First, there is a principle of ``learning less is more'' in inventory management: depending on the amount of data available, it may be beneficial to restrict oneself to a simpler, albeit suboptimal, class of inventory policies to minimize overfitting errors. Second, the number of parameters in a policy class may not be the correct measure of overfitting error: in fact, the class of policies defined by T time-varying base-stock levels exhibits a generalization error an order of magnitude lower than that of the two-parameter (s, S) policy class. Finally, our research suggests situations in which it could be beneficial to incorporate the concepts of base-stock and inventory position into black-box learning machines, instead of having these machines directly learn the order quantity actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doubly robust learning offers a robust framework for causal inference from observational data by integrating propensity score and outcome modeling. Despite its theoretical appeal, practical adoption remains limited due to perceived complexity and inaccessible software. This tutorial aims to demystify doubly robust methods and demonstrate their application using the EconML package. We provide an introduction to causal inference, discuss the principles of outcome modeling and propensity scores, and illustrate the doubly robust approach through simulated case studies. By simplifying the methodology and offering practical coding examples, we intend to make doubly robust learning accessible to researchers and practitioners in data science and statistics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sparse Singular Value Decomposition for High-dimensional High-order Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.01796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the sparse tensor singular value decomposition, which aims for dimension reduction on high-dimensional high-order data with certain sparsity structure. A method named Sparse Tensor Alternating Thresholding for Singular Value Decomposition (STAT-SVD) is proposed. The proposed procedure features a novel double projection \&amp; thresholding scheme, which provides a sharp criterion for thresholding in each iteration. Compared with regular tensor SVD model, STAT-SVD permits more robust estimation under weaker assumptions. Both the upper and lower bounds for estimation accuracy are developed. The proposed procedure is shown to be minimax rate-optimal in a general class of situations. Simulation studies show that STAT-SVD performs well under a variety of configurations. We also illustrate the merits of the proposed procedure on a longitudinal tensor dataset on European country mortality rates.</description>

      <title>Improved Global Guarantees for the Nonconvex Burer--Monteiro Factorization via Rank Overparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.01789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider minimizing a twice-differentiable, $L$-smooth, and $\mu$-strongly convex objective $\phi$ over an $n\times n$ positive semidefinite matrix $M\succeq0$, under the assumption that the minimizer $M^{\star}$ has low rank $r^{\star}\ll n$. Following the Burer--Monteiro approach, we instead minimize the nonconvex objective $f(X)=\phi(XX^{T})$ over a factor matrix $X$ of size $n\times r$. This substantially reduces the number of variables from $O(n^{2})$ to as few as $O(n)$ and also enforces positive semidefiniteness for free, but at the cost of giving up the convexity of the original problem. In this paper, we prove that if the search rank $r\ge r^{\star}$ is overparameterized by a \emph{constant factor} with respect to the true rank $r^{\star}$, namely as in $r&gt;\frac{1}{4}(L/\mu-1)^{2}r^{\star}$, then despite nonconvexity, local optimization is guaranteed to globally converge from any initial point to the global optimum. This significantly improves upon a previous rank overparameterization threshold of $r\ge n$, which we show is sharp in the absence of smoothness and strong convexity, but would increase the number of variables back up to $O(n^{2})$. Conversely, without rank overparameterization, we prove that such a global guarantee is possible if and only if $\phi$ is almost perfectly conditioned, with a condition number of $L/\mu&lt;3$. Therefore, we conclude that a small amount of overparameterization can lead to large improvements in theoretical guarantees for the nonconvex Burer--Monteiro factorization.</description>

      <title>Information FOMO: The unhealthy fear of missing out on information. A method for removing misleading data for healthier models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misleading or unnecessary data can have out-sized impacts on the health or accuracy of Machine Learning (ML) models. We present a Bayesian sequential selection method, akin to Bayesian experimental design, that identifies critically important information within a dataset, while ignoring data that is either misleading or brings unnecessary complexity to the surrogate model of choice. Our method improves sample-wise error convergence and eliminates instances where more data leads to worse performance and instabilities of the surrogate model, often termed sample-wise ``double descent''. We find these instabilities are a result of the complexity of the underlying map and linked to extreme events and heavy tails.
  Our approach has two key features. First, the selection algorithm dynamically couples the chosen model and data. Data is chosen based on its merits towards improving the selected model, rather than being compared strictly against other data. Second, a natural convergence of the method removes the need for dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Instead, the selection metric inherently assesses testing and validation error through global statistics of the model. This ensures that key information is never wasted in testing or validation. The method is applied using both Gaussian process regression and deep neural network surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Active Learning and Bayesian Optimization: a Unified Perspective to Learn with a Goal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science and Engineering applications are typically associated with expensive optimization problems to identify optimal design solutions and states of the system of interest. Bayesian optimization and active learning compute surrogate models through efficient adaptive sampling schemes to assist and accelerate this search task toward a given optimization goal. Both those methodologies are driven by specific infill/learning criteria which quantify the utility with respect to the set goal of evaluating the objective function for unknown combinations of optimization variables. While the two fields have seen an exponential growth in popularity in the past decades, their dualism and synergy have received relatively little attention to date. This paper discusses and formalizes the synergy between Bayesian optimization and active learning as symbiotic adaptive sampling methodologies driven by common principles. In particular, we demonstrate this unified perspective through the formalization of the analogy between the Bayesian infill criteria and active learning criteria as driving principles of both the goal-driven procedures. To support our original perspective, we propose a general classification of adaptive sampling techniques to highlight similarities and differences between the vast families of adaptive sampling, active learning, and Bayesian optimization. Accordingly, the synergy is demonstrated mapping the Bayesian infill criteria with the active learning criteria, and is formalized for searches informed by both a single information source and multiple levels of fidelity. In addition, we provide guidelines to apply those learning criteria investigating the performance of different Bayesian schemes for a variety of benchmark problems to highlight benefits and limitations over mathematical properties that characterize real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19685v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based approach for numerical simulation of a time-evolving Schr\"odinger equation inspired by stochastic mechanics and generative diffusion models. Unlike existing approaches, which exhibit computational complexity that scales exponentially in the problem dimension, our method allows us to adapt to the latent low-dimensional structure of the wave function by sampling from the Markovian diffusion. Depending on the latent dimension, our method may have far lower computational complexity in higher dimensions. Moreover, we propose novel equations for stochastic quantum mechanics, resulting in quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of dimensions. Numerical simulations verify our theoretical findings and show a significant advantage of our method compared to other deep-learning-based approaches used for quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is often highlighted as one of the most promising practical applications for which quantum computers could provide a computational advantage. However, a major obstacle to the widespread use of quantum machine learning models in practice is that these models, even once trained, still require access to a quantum computer in order to be evaluated on new data. To solve this issue, we introduce a new class of quantum models where quantum resources are only required during training, while the deployment of the trained model is classical. Specifically, the training phase of our models ends with the generation of a 'shadow model' from which the classical deployment becomes possible. We prove that: i) this class of models is universal for classically-deployed quantum machine learning; ii) it does have restricted learning capacities compared to 'fully quantum' models, but nonetheless iii) it achieves a provable learning advantage over fully classical learners, contingent on widely-believed assumptions in complexity theory. These results provide compelling evidence that quantum machine learning can confer learning advantages across a substantially broader range of scenarios, where quantum computers are exclusively employed during the training phase. By enabling classical deployment, our approach facilitates the implementation of quantum machine learning models in various practical contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning graph geometry and topology using dynamical systems based message-passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce DYMAG: a message passing paradigm for GNNs built on the expressive power of continuous, multiscale graph-dynamics. Standard discrete-time message passing algorithms implicitly make use of simplistic graph dynamics and aggregation schemes which limit their ability to capture fundamental graph topological properties. By contrast, DYMAG makes use of complex graph dynamics based on the heat and wave equation as well as a more complex equation which admits chaotic solutions. The continuous nature of the dynamics are leveraged to generate multiscale (dynamic-time snapshot) representations which we prove are linked to various graph topological and spectral properties. We demonstrate experimentally that DYMAG achieves superior performance in recovering the generating parameters of Erd\"os-Renyi and stochastic block model random graphs and the persistent homology of synthetic graphs and citation network. Since the behavior of proteins and biomolecules is sensitive to graph topology and exhibits important structure at multiple scales, we find that DYMAG outperforms other methods at predicting salient features of various biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Model-based causal feature selection for general response types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12833v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a fundamental yet challenging task. Invariant causal prediction (ICP, Peters et al., 2016) is a method for causal feature selection which requires data from heterogeneous settings and exploits that causal models are invariant. ICP has been extended to general additive noise models and to nonparametric settings using conditional independence tests. However, the latter often suffer from low power (or poor type I error control) and additive noise models are not suitable for applications in which the response is not measured on a continuous scale, but reflects categories or counts. Here, we develop transformation-model (TRAM) based ICP, allowing for continuous, categorical, count-type, and uninformatively censored responses (these model classes, generally, do not allow for identifiability when there is no exogenous heterogeneity). As an invariance test, we propose TRAM-GCM based on the expected conditional covariance between environments and score residuals with uniform asymptotic level guarantees. For the special case of linear shift TRAMs, we also consider TRAM-Wald, which tests invariance based on the Wald statistic. We provide an open-source R package 'tramicp' and evaluate our approach on simulated data and in a case study investigating causal features of survival in critically ill patients.</description>

      <title>The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>

      <title>A Universal Growth Rate for Learning with Smooth Surrogate Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the growth rate of $H$-consistency bounds (and excess error bounds) for various surrogate losses used in classification. We prove a square-root growth rate near zero for smooth margin-based surrogate losses in binary classification, providing both upper and lower bounds under mild assumptions. This result also translates to excess error bounds. Our lower bound requires weaker conditions than those in previous work for excess error bounds, and our upper bound is entirely novel. Moreover, we extend this analysis to multi-class classification with a series of novel results, demonstrating a universal square-root growth rate for smooth comp-sum and constrained losses, covering common choices for training neural networks in multi-class classification. Given this universal rate, we turn to the question of choosing among different surrogate losses. We first examine how $H$-consistency bounds vary across surrogates based on the number of classes. Next, ignoring constants and focusing on behavior near zero, we identify minimizability gaps as the key differentiating factor in these bounds. Thus, we thoroughly analyze these gaps, to guide surrogate loss selection, covering: comparisons across different comp-sum losses, conditions where gaps become zero, and general conditions leading to small gaps. Additionally, we demonstrate the key role of minimizability gaps in comparing excess error bounds and $H$-consistency bounds.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Kernel Ridge Regression Based on Data-Dependent Random Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random feature (RF) has been widely used for node consistency in decentralized kernel ridge regression (KRR). Currently, the consistency is guaranteed by imposing constraints on coefficients of features, necessitating that the random features on different nodes are identical. However, in many applications, data on different nodes varies significantly on the number or distribution, which calls for adaptive and data-dependent methods that generate different RFs. To tackle the essential difficulty, we propose a new decentralized KRR algorithm that pursues consensus on decision functions, which allows great flexibility and well adapts data on nodes. The convergence is rigorously given and the effectiveness is numerically verified: by capturing the characteristics of the data on each node, while maintaining the same communication costs as other methods, we achieved an average regression accuracy improvement of 25.5\% across six real-world data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in the $P$-pass streaming model. In this problem, the $n$ arms are present in a stream and at most $m&lt;n$ arms and their statistics can be stored in the memory. We give a complete characterization of the optimal regret in terms of $m, n$ and $P$. Specifically, we design an algorithm with $\tilde O\left((n-m)^{1+\frac{2^{P}-2}{2^{P+1}-1}} n^{\frac{2-2^{P+1}}{2^{P+1}-1}} T^{\frac{2^P}{2^{P+1}-1}}\right)$ regret and complement it with an $\tilde \Omega\left((n-m)^{1+\frac{2^{P}-2}{2^{P+1}-1}} n^{\frac{2-2^{P+1}}{2^{P+1}-1}} T^{\frac{2^P}{2^{P+1}-1}}\right)$ lower bound when the number of rounds $T$ is sufficiently large. Our results are tight up to a logarithmic factor in $n$ and $P$.</description>

      <title>Black Box Differential Privacy Auditing Using Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a practical method to audit the differential privacy (DP) guarantees of a machine learning model using a small hold-out dataset that is not exposed to the model during the training. Having a score function such as the loss function employed during the training, our method estimates the total variation (TV) distance between scores obtained with a subset of the training data and the hold-out dataset. With some meta information about the underlying DP training algorithm, these TV distance values can be converted to $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-guarantees for any $\delta$. We show that these score distributions asymptotically give lower bounds for the DP guarantees of the underlying training algorithm, however, we perform a one-shot estimation for practicality reasons. We specify conditions that lead to lower bounds for the DP guarantees with high probability. To estimate the TV distance between the score distributions, we use a simple density estimation method based on histograms. We show that the TV distance gives a very close to optimally robust estimator and has an error rate $\mathcal{O}(k^{-1/3})$, where $k$ is the total number of samples. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and show improvements over baseline methods for black-box auditing.</description>

      <title>Statistical ranking with dynamic covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a covariate-assisted ranking model grounded in the Plackett--Luce framework. Unlike existing works focusing on pure covariates or individual effects with fixed covariates, our approach integrates individual effects with dynamic covariates. This added flexibility enhances realistic ranking yet poses significant challenges for analyzing the associated estimation procedures. This paper makes an initial attempt to address these challenges. We begin by discussing the sufficient and necessary condition for the model's identifiability. We then introduce an efficient alternating maximization algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Under suitable assumptions on the topology of comparison graphs and dynamic covariates, we establish a quantitative uniform consistency result for the MLE with convergence rates characterized by the asymptotic graph connectivity. The proposed graph topology assumption holds for several popular random graph models under optimal leading-order sparsity conditions. A comprehensive numerical study is conducted to corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the application of the proposed model to real-world datasets, including horse racing and tennis competitions.</description>

      <title>Research on Autonomous Robots Navigation based on Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning continuously optimizes decision-making based on real-time feedback reward signals through continuous interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong adaptive and self-learning capabilities. In recent years, it has become one of the key methods to achieve autonomous navigation of robots. In this work, an autonomous robot navigation method based on reinforcement learning is introduced. We use the Deep Q Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) models to optimize the path planning and decision-making process through the continuous interaction between the robot and the environment, and the reward signals with real-time feedback. By combining the Q-value function with the deep neural network, deep Q network can handle high-dimensional state space, so as to realize path planning in complex environments. Proximal policy optimization is a strategy gradient-based method, which enables robots to explore and utilize environmental information more efficiently by optimizing policy functions. These methods not only improve the robot's navigation ability in the unknown environment, but also enhance its adaptive and self-learning capabilities. Through multiple training and simulation experiments, we have verified the effectiveness and robustness of these models in various complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robust CATE Estimation Using Novel Ensemble Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) is crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of treatment effects in clinical trials. We evaluate the performance of common methods, including causal forests and various meta-learners, across a diverse set of scenarios revealing that each of the methods fails in one or more of the tested scenarios. Given the inherent uncertainty of the data-generating process in real-life scenarios, the robustness of a CATE estimator to various scenarios is critical for its reliability.
  To address this limitation of existing methods, we propose two new ensemble methods that integrate multiple estimators to enhance prediction stability and performance - Stacked X-Learner which uses the X-Learner with model stacking for estimating the nuisance functions, and Consensus Based Averaging (CBA), which averages only the models with highest internal agreement. We show that these models achieve good performance across a wide range of scenarios varying in complexity, sample size and structure of the underlying-mechanism, including a biologically driven model for PD-L1 inhibition pathway for cancer treatment.</description>

      <title>Speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models: Wisdom from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a connection between a generative model, called the diffusion model, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics for the Fokker-Planck equation, called stochastic thermodynamics. Based on the techniques of stochastic thermodynamics, we derive the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models, which is a trade-off relationship between the speed and accuracy of data generation in diffusion models. Our result implies that the entropy production rate in the forward process affects the errors in data generation. From a stochastic thermodynamic perspective, our results provide quantitative insight into how best to generate data in diffusion models. The optimal learning protocol is introduced by the conservative force in stochastic thermodynamics and the geodesic of space by the 2-Wasserstein distance in optimal transport theory. We numerically illustrate the validity of the speed-accuracy trade-off for the diffusion models with different noise schedules such as the cosine schedule, the conditional optimal transport, and the optimal transport.</description>
