      <title>Evaluation of Table Representations to Answer Questions from Tables in Documents : A Case Study using 3GPP Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ubiquitous use of document corpora for question answering, one important aspect which is especially relevant for technical documents is the ability to extract information from tables which are interspersed with text. The major challenge in this is that unlike free-flow text or isolated set of tables, the representation of a table in terms of what is a relevant chunk is not obvious. We conduct a series of experiments examining various representations of tabular data interspersed with text to understand the relative benefits of different representations. We choose a corpus of $3^{rd}$ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) documents since they are heavily interspersed with tables. We create expert curated dataset of question answers to evaluate our approach. We conclude that row level representations with corresponding table header information being included in every cell improves the performance of the retrieval, thus leveraging the structural information present in the tabular data.</description>

      <title>Understanding the User: An Intent-Based Ranking Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As information retrieval systems continue to evolve, accurate evaluation and benchmarking of these systems become pivotal. Web search datasets, such as MS MARCO, primarily provide short keyword queries without accompanying intent or descriptions, posing a challenge in comprehending the underlying information need. This paper proposes an approach to augmenting such datasets to annotate informative query descriptions, with a focus on two prominent benchmark datasets: TREC-DL-21 and TREC-DL-22. Our methodology involves utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs to analyze and comprehend the implicit intent within individual queries from benchmark datasets. By extracting key semantic elements, we construct detailed and contextually rich descriptions for these queries. To validate the generated query descriptions, we employ crowdsourcing as a reliable means of obtaining diverse human perspectives on the accuracy and informativeness of the descriptions. This information can be used as an evaluation set for tasks such as ranking, query rewriting, or others.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-task Prompt Tuning for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the expansion of business scenarios, real recommender systems are facing challenges in dealing with the constantly emerging new tasks in multi-task learning frameworks. In this paper, we attempt to improve the generalization ability of multi-task recommendations when dealing with new tasks. We find that joint training will enhance the performance of the new task but always negatively impact existing tasks in most multi-task learning methods. Besides, such a re-training mechanism with new tasks increases the training costs, limiting the generalization ability of multi-task recommendation models. Based on this consideration, we aim to design a suitable sharing mechanism among different tasks while maintaining joint optimization efficiency in new task learning. A novel two-stage prompt-tuning MTL framework (MPT-Rec) is proposed to address task irrelevance and training efficiency problems in multi-task recommender systems. Specifically, we disentangle the task-specific and task-sharing information in the multi-task pre-training stage, then use task-aware prompts to transfer knowledge from other tasks to the new task effectively. By freezing parameters in the pre-training tasks, MPT-Rec solves the negative impacts that may be brought by the new task and greatly reduces the training costs. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed multi-task learning framework. MPT-Rec achieves the best performance compared to the SOTA multi-task learning method. Besides, it maintains comparable model performance but vastly improves the training efficiency (i.e., with up to 10% parameters in the full training way) in the new task learning.</description>

      <title>Metadata practices for simulation workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations are an essential pillar of knowledge generation in science. Understanding, reproducing, and exploring the results of simulations relies on tracking and organizing metadata describing numerical experiments. However, the models used to understand real-world systems, and the computational machinery required to simulate them, are typically complex, and produce large amounts of heterogeneous metadata. Here, we present general practices for acquiring and handling metadata that are agnostic to software and hardware, and highly flexible for the user. These consist of two steps: 1) recording and storing raw metadata, and 2) selecting and structuring metadata. As a proof of concept, we develop the Archivist, a Python tool to help with the second step, and use it to apply our practices to distinct high-performance computing use cases from neuroscience and hydrology. Our practices and the Archivist can readily be applied to existing workflows without the need for substantial restructuring. They support sustainable numerical workflows, facilitating reproducibility and data reuse in generic simulation-based research.</description>

      <title>Not All Videos Become Outdated: Short-Video Recommendation by Learning to Deconfound Release Interval Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-video recommender systems often exhibit a biased preference to recently released videos. However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic videos can still attract user's attention. Such bias along temporal dimension can be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos, because the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we observe that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in attracting users' attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling short-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a confounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address this confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called Learning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly learning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In the inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the backdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and exhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional comprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI.</description>

      <title>rerankers: A Lightweight Python Library to Unify Ranking Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents rerankers, a Python library which provides an easy-to-use interface to the most commonly used re-ranking approaches. Re-ranking is an integral component of many retrieval pipelines; however, there exist numerous approaches to it, relying on different implementation methods. \texttt{rerankers} unifies these methods into a single user-friendly interface, allowing practitioners and researchers alike to explore different methods while only changing a single line of Python code. Moreover ,rerankers ensures that its implementations are done with the fewest dependencies possible, and re-uses the original implementation whenever possible, guaranteeing that our simplified interface results in no performance degradation compared to more complex ones. The full source code and list of supported models are updated regularly and available at https://github.com/answerdotai/rerankers.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Modularity, a Modularity for Link Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks are commonly used to model real-life phenomena. When these phenomena represent interactions and are captured at a fine-grained temporal resolution, they are modeled as link streams. Community detection is an essential network analysis task. Although many methods exist for static networks, and some methods have been developed for temporal networks represented as sequences of snapshots, few works can handle link streams. This article introduces the first adaptation of the well-known Modularity quality function to link streams. Unlike existing methods, it is independent of the time scale of analysis. After introducing the quality function, and its relation to existing static and dynamic definitions of Modularity, we show experimentally its relevance for dynamic community evaluation.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Model of Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain with EigenTrust-Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Protocol to Manage Decentralized Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the emergence of decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) due to patient retention, accelerate trials, improve data accessibility, enable virtual care, and facilitate seamless communication through integrated systems. However, integrating systems in DCTs exposes clinical data to potential security threats, making them susceptible to theft at any stage, a high risk of protocol deviations, and monitoring issues. To mitigate these challenges, blockchain technology serves as a secure framework, acting as a decentralized ledger, creating an immutable environment by establishing a zero-trust architecture, where data are deemed untrusted until verified. In combination with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable devices, blockchain secures the transfer of clinical trial data on private blockchains during DCT automation and operations. This paper proposes a prototype model of the Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain (z-TAB) to integrate patient-generated clinical trial data during DCT operation management. The EigenTrust-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (T-PBFT) algorithm has been incorporated as a consensus protocol, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated to streamline data processing among stakeholders within the blockchain platforms. Rigorous evaluation has been done to evaluate the quality of the system.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Clustering Counter Relationships of Team Compositions in PvP Games for Efficient Balance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can balance be quantified in game settings? This question is crucial for game designers, especially in player-versus-player (PvP) games, where analyzing the strength relations among predefined team compositions-such as hero combinations in multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games or decks in card games-is essential for enhancing gameplay and achieving balance. We have developed two advanced measures that extend beyond the simplistic win rate to quantify balance in zero-sum competitive scenarios. These measures are derived from win value estimations, which employ strength rating approximations via the Bradley-Terry model and counter relationship approximations via vector quantization, significantly reducing the computational complexity associated with traditional win value estimations. Throughout the learning process of these models, we identify useful categories of compositions and pinpoint their counter relationships, aligning with the experiences of human players without requiring specific game knowledge. Our methodology hinges on a simple technique to enhance codebook utilization in discrete representation with a deterministic vector quantization process for an extremely small state space. Our framework has been validated in popular online games, including Age of Empires II, Hearthstone, Brawl Stars, and League of Legends. The accuracy of the observed strength relations in these games is comparable to traditional pairwise win value predictions, while also offering a more manageable complexity for analysis. Ultimately, our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of PvP game dynamics and present a methodology that significantly improves game balance evaluation and design.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Cognitive Biases in the Recommendation Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cognitive biases have been studied in psychology, sociology, and behavioral economics for decades. Traditionally, they have been considered a negative human trait that leads to inferior decision-making, reinforcement of stereotypes, or can be exploited to manipulate consumers, respectively. We argue that cognitive biases also manifest in different parts of the recommendation ecosystem and at different stages of the recommendation process. More importantly, we contest this traditional detrimental perspective on cognitive biases and claim that certain cognitive biases can be beneficial when accounted for by recommender systems. Concretely, we provide empirical evidence that biases such as feature-positive effect, Ikea effect, and cultural homophily can be observed in various components of the recommendation pipeline, including input data (such as ratings or side information), recommendation algorithm or model (and consequently recommended items), and user interactions with the system. In three small experiments covering recruitment and entertainment domains, we study the pervasiveness of the aforementioned biases. We ultimately advocate for a prejudice-free consideration of cognitive biases to improve user and item models as well as recommendation algorithms.</description>

      <title>SynDL: A Large-Scale Synthetic Test Collection for Passage Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale test collections play a crucial role in Information Retrieval (IR) research. However, according to the Cranfield paradigm and the research into publicly available datasets, the existing information retrieval research studies are commonly developed on small-scale datasets that rely on human assessors for relevance judgments - a time-intensive and expensive process. Recent studies have shown the strong capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in producing reliable relevance judgments with human accuracy but at a greatly reduced cost. In this paper, to address the missing large-scale ad-hoc document retrieval dataset, we extend the TREC Deep Learning Track (DL) test collection via additional language model synthetic labels to enable researchers to test and evaluate their search systems at a large scale. Specifically, such a test collection includes more than 1,900 test queries from the previous years of tracks. We compare system evaluation with past human labels from past years and find that our synthetically created large-scale test collection can lead to highly correlated system rankings.</description>

      <title>Use of a Structured Knowledge Base Enhances Metadata Curation by Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05893v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metadata play a crucial role in ensuring the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of datasets. This paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to improve adherence to metadata standards. We conducted experiments on 200 random data records describing human samples relating to lung cancer from the NCBI BioSample repository, evaluating GPT-4's ability to suggest edits for adherence to metadata standards. We computed the adherence accuracy of field name-field value pairs through a peer review process, and we observed a marginal average improvement in adherence to the standard data dictionary from 79% to 80% (p&lt;0.5). We then prompted GPT-4 with domain information in the form of the textual descriptions of CEDAR templates and recorded a significant improvement to 97% from 79% (p&lt;0.01). These results indicate that, while LLMs may not be able to correct legacy metadata to ensure satisfactory adherence to standards when unaided, they do show promise for use in automated metadata curation when integrated with a structured knowledge base</description>

      <title>Perceptual Similarity for Measuring Decision-Making Style and Policy Diversity in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining and measuring decision-making styles, also known as playstyles, is crucial in gaming, where these styles reflect a broad spectrum of individuality and diversity. However, finding a universally applicable measure for these styles poses a challenge. Building on Playstyle Distance, the first unsupervised metric to measure playstyle similarity based on game screens and raw actions, we introduce three enhancements to increase accuracy: multiscale analysis with varied state granularity, a perceptual kernel rooted in psychology, and the utilization of the intersection-over-union method for efficient evaluation. These innovations not only advance measurement precision but also offer insights into human cognition of similarity. Across two racing games and seven Atari games, our techniques significantly improve the precision of zero-shot playstyle classification, achieving an accuracy exceeding 90 percent with fewer than 512 observation-action pairs, which is less than half an episode of these games. Furthermore, our experiments with 2048 and Go demonstrate the potential of discrete playstyle measures in puzzle and board games. We also develop an algorithm for assessing decision-making diversity using these measures. Our findings improve the measurement of end-to-end game analysis and the evolution of artificial intelligence for diverse playstyles.</description>
