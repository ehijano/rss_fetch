      <title>Reentrant Landau Levels in a Dirac topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum limit, where magnetic fields confine carriers to the lowest Landau level, is predicted to host exotic quantum phases arising from strengthened electronic correlations, reduced dimensionality, and increased degeneracy. We report a novel quantization regime realized in the ultra-quantum limit of the narrow-gap Dirac insulator ZrTe5, marked by anomalous magnetoresistance oscillations. These oscillations, measured in ZrTe5 single crystals down to 700 mK and up to 60 T, are distinctly non-1/B periodic and persist for magnetic fields well beyond the quantum limit. In this regime, the competition between Zeeman and cyclotron energies drives a nonlinear evolution and back-bending of Landau levels, causing low-index levels to re-cross the Fermi energy at high fields. This mechanism departs from the standard Lifshitz-Kosevich description and provides a framework to describe how the electronic structure in topological Dirac insulators evolves beyond the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Energy-Dependent Magnetic Modifications in HOPG via Microbeam Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medium-energy ion irradiation is a promising technique for inducing magnetism in materials with partially filled d or f electron bands. This approach enables precise control over the density and spatial distribution of irradiation-induced defects, which play a crucial role in modifying the electronic and magnetic properties of the system. The primary objective of this experiment was to investigate the influence of ion energy variation on the magnetic properties of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). To achieve this, HOPG samples were irradiated with protons 1-3 MeV and carbon ions 600 keV - 2 MeV. A significant change in the magnetic moment was observed with respect to the irradiation energy for both ion species. The effect of energy variation was analyzed using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and SRIM simulations. The results demonstrate that ion-beam-induced magnetic ordering strongly depends on both the ion species and the beam energy. Magnetic measurements were performed with varying irradiation energies, showing that carbon ion irradiation produces a higher degree of magnetic ordering compared to proton irradiation at the same dose. The maximum magnetization was obtained at 1.2 MeV carbon ion irradiation. SRIM simulations confirm that carbon ions create a greater number of lattice defects than proton ions, which correlates with the enhanced magnetic response.</description>

      <title>Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</description>
