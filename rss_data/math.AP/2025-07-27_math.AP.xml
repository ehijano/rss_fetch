      <title>Existence of an Infinite Number of Solutions to a Singular Superlinear p-Laplacian Equation on Exterior Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of an infinite number of radial solutions of the $p$-$Laplacian$ equation $\Delta_p u + K(|x|) f(u) =0$ on the exterior of the ball of radius $R&gt;0$ in ${\mathbb R}^{N}$ such that $u(|x|)\to 0$ as $|x|\to \infty$ where $f$ grows superlinearly at infinity and is singular at $0$ with $f(u) \sim -\frac{1}{|u|^{m-1}u}$ and $0&lt;m&lt;1$ for small $u$. We also assume $K(|x|) \sim |x|^{-\alpha}$ for large $|x|$ where $N + \frac{m(N-p)}{p-1}&lt; \alpha&lt;2(N-1).$</description>

      <title>A connection between quantum dot Dirac operators and $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacians in the context of shape optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for quantum dot Dirac operators with nonnegative mass on bounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that this family of inequalities is equivalent to a family of Faber-Krahn-type inequalities for $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacians. Thanks to this, we prove them in the case of simply connected domains for quantum dot boundary conditions asymptotically close to zigzag boundary conditions. Finally, we also study the case of negative mass.</description>

      <title>Variational principles on the space of Lorenz curves: Gradient structures and isometries inspired by Wasserstein geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We motivate and derive novel Riemannian gradient structures on the space of Lorenz curves, which preserve infinite-dimensional variational principles inherited from Fokker-Planck equations via the lens of Wasserstein geometry and its variants. We also prove isometry results between corresponding formal manifolds of probability measures and Lorenz curves, which suggest meaningful metrics on the space of Lorenz curves when an underlying kinetic premise is present. In so doing, elegant variational principles are imbued upon highly nonlinear and nonlocal integro-differential evolution equations resulting from a recently derived variable transformation of McKean-Vlasov Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of variational problems in the space of functions with bounded $\mathcal{B}$-variation: interaction with measures and lack of concentration phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an integral representation result for variational functionals in the space $BV^{\mathcal{B}}$ of functions with bounded $\mathcal{B}$-variation where $\mathcal{B}$ denotes a $k$-th order, $\mathbb{C}$-elliptic, linear homogeneous differential operator. This result has been used as a key tool to get an explicit representation of relaxed energies with linear growth which lead to limiting generic measures. According to the space dimension and the order of the operator, concentration phenomena appear and an explicit interaction is featured. These results are complemented also with Sobolev-type counterparts. As a further application, a lower semicontinuity result in the space of fields with $p(\cdot)$-bounded $\mathcal{B}$-variation has also been obtained.</description>

Abstract: We study the De Giorgi-Moser-Nash estimates of higher-order parabolic equations in divergence form with complex-valued, measurable, bounded, uniformly elliptic (in the sense of G$\mathring{a}$rding inequality) and time-independent coefficients. We also obtain Gaussian upper bounds and H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for the fundamental solutions of this class of parabolic equations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inverse Problems on Metric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the formulation, well-posedness, and numerical solution of Bayesian inverse problems on metric graphs, in which the edges represent one-dimensional wires connecting vertices. We focus on the inverse problem of recovering the diffusion coefficient of a (fractional) elliptic equation on a metric graph from noisy measurements of the solution. Well-posedness hinges on both stability of the forward model and an appropriate choice of prior. We establish the stability of elliptic and fractional elliptic forward models using recent regularity theory for differential equations on metric graphs. For the prior, we leverage modern Gaussian Whittle--Mat\'ern process models on metric graphs with sufficiently smooth sample paths. Numerical results demonstrate accurate reconstruction and effective uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of PINNs for inverse source problem in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of recovering the spatial profile of the source in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation from regional observation data at fixed times. We establish two types of sufficient measurements for the unique solvability of the inverse problem. The first is to determine the source term by using whole data at one fixed instant. Conditional stability is established by using the eigenfunction expansion argument. Next, using the analytic continuation method, both uniqueness and a stability estimate for recovering the unknown source can be established from local data at two instants. Finally, algorithms based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are proposed, and several numerical experiments are presented to show the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A priori H\"older estimates for equations degenerating on nodal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a priori H\"older bounds for continuous solutions to degenerate equations with variable coefficients of type $$ \mathrm{div}\left(u^2 A\nabla w\right)=0\quad\mathrm{in \ }\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n,\qquad \mbox{with}\qquad \mathrm{div}\left(A\nabla u\right)=0, $$ where $A$ is a Lipschitz continuous, uniformly elliptic matrix (possibly $u$ has non-trivial singular nodal set). Such estimates are uniform with respect to $u$ in a class of normalized solutions that have a bounded Almgren frequency. As a consequence, a boundary Harnack principle holds for the quotient of two solutions vanishing on a common set.
  This analysis relies on a detailed study of the associated weighted Sobolev spaces, including integrability of the weight, capacitary properties of the nodal set, and uniform Sobolev inequalities yielding local boundedness of solutions.</description>

      <title>Counterexample to the second eigenfunction having one zero for a non-local Schrodinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the second eigenfunction of a perturbed fractional Laplace operator on a bounded interval can exhibit two sign changes, in stark contrast with the classical expectation that it should have exactly one zero. Our construction employs the Kato-Rellich regular perturbation theory to analyse an infinite potential well eigenvalue problem, and then uses an energy-minimisation argument to extend this counterexample to finite potential wells. Although our detailed analysis focuses on the case where s takes value 1/2 (the Cauchy process), our approach strongly suggests that similar phenomena occur for other rational values of s in (0, 1). At the time of writing, this result provides one of the first rigorous insights into the qualitative behaviour of eigenfunctions for perturbed nonlocal Schrodinger operators.</description>

      <title>Modulus of continuity for solutions of non-local heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the method of modulus of continuity for solutions of parabolic equations--as used, for instance, to prove the Fundamental Gap Conjecture--to solutions of non-local heat equations on R^n and in dimension one with a non-local Neumann boundary condition. Specifically, we show that if a solution of a non-local heat equation has an initial modulus of continuity satisfying simple criteria, then this modulus of continuity is preserved at all subsequent times. In the process of trying to generalise our result in one dimension, we found a counterexample suggesting that a non-local analogue of the Payne-Weinberger inequality would depend on more than the diameter of a bounded (convex) domain.</description>

      <title>Stability of laminar monotone shear flows in a channel for high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stability of a laminar flow $U\in C^4([-1,1])$ in the two-dimensional channel $\mathbb{R} \times[-1,1]$ in the large Reynolds number limit. Assuming that $U$ is strictly monotone but allowing $U^{\prime\prime}$ to vanish, we obtain that if the operator
  $$
  {\mathcal K}_{\nu}=-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+\frac{U^{\prime\prime}}{U-\nu} \,, $$ is strictly positive for all $\nu\in\mathbb{R}$ for which $U^{\prime\prime}(U^{-1}(\nu))=0$,then $U$ is stable for sufficiently large Reynolds number. This contribution generalizes previous results mostly by allowing long wave perturbations (but much shorter than the Reynolds number).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I will summarize the uniform decay estimates of the discrete wave equations (DW) established by the oscillatory integral theory in [Sch98, BCH23, BCH24], and combine the abstract framework of the scattering theory of the dispersive equations established in [Str81] to finally establish the scattering theory of the discrete nonlinear wave equations (DNLW), including the existence of the wave operators and the asymptotic completeness. In addition, I will establish the scattering theory again by the Strichartz estimate.</description>

      <title>On polarization interface conditions for time-harmonic Maxwell's equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations with a polarization interface condition. The interface condition demands that one component of the electric field vanishes at the interface and that the corresponding component of the magnetic field has no jump across the interface. These conditions have been derived in the literature as a homogenization limit for thin wire inclusion. We analyze the limit equations and provide an existence result and a Fredholm-alternative.</description>

      <title>Infinite Dimensional Mean-Field Belavkin Equation: Well-posedness and Derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the mean-field limit of a stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation arising in quantum optimal control and mean-field games, where N interacting particles undergo continuous indirect measurement. For the open quantum system described by Belavkin's filtering equation, we derive a mean-field approximation under minimal assumptions, extending prior results limited to bounded operators and finitedimensional settings. By establishing global well-posedness via fixed-point methods-avoiding measure-change techniques-we obtain higher regularity solutions. Furthermore, we prove rigorous convergence to the mean-field limit in an infinitedimensional framework. Our work provides the first derivation of such limits for wave functions in $L^2 (R^d)$, with implications for simulating and controlling large quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A Wave-type Model for Age- and Space-structured Epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach of epidemic modeling by combining age-structured models with damped wave equations. This transforms the parabolic-type reaction-diffusion model into a hyperbolic system that shares many properties with a wave or telegrapher's equation. After we establish the existence of a weak solution of the resulting partial differential equation by means of characteristics, we show that the solutions to the new model converge to a solution of the standard age-dependent reaction-diffusion equation when we let the wave parameter become arbitrarily small. We conclude with a numerical example to illustrate the behavior of the new model and to further support our findings.</description>

      <title>Vanishing viscosity non-unique solutions to the forced 2D Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forced 2D Euler equations exhibit non-unique solutions with vorticity in $L^p$, $p &gt; 1$, whereas the corresponding Navier-Stokes solutions are unique. We investigate whether the inviscid limit $\nu \to 0^+$ from the forced 2D Navier-Stokes to Euler equations is a selection principle capable of "resolving" the non-uniqueness. We focus on solutions in a neighborhood of the non-uniqueness scenario discovered by Vishik; specifically, we incorporate viscosity $\nu$ and consider $O(\varepsilon)$ size perturbations of the initial datum. We discover a uniqueness threshold $\varepsilon \sim \nu^{\kappa_{\rm c}}$, below which the vanishing viscosity solution is unique and radial, and at which there are viscous solutions converging to non-unique, non-radial solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a free boundary problem of low Mach number magnetohydrodynamic flow in spatial dimension n $\geq$ 2. A priori estimates of the second fundamental form and various flow quantities in Sobolev norms are obtained by adopting the geometrical point of view introduced by Christodoulou and Lindblad [3]. Moreover, a blow up criterion is derived by using the method of Beale, Kato and Majda [2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider transmission problems for parabolic equations governed by distinct fully nonlinear operators on each side of a time-dependent interface. We prove that if the interface is $C^{1,\alpha}$, in the parabolic sense, then viscosity solutions are piecewise $C^{1,\alpha}$ up to the interface. As byproducts, we obtain a new ABP-Krylov-Tso estimate, and establish existence, uniqueness, a comparison principle, and regularity results for the flat interface problem.</description>

      <title>Concentration comparison for nonlinear diffusion on model manifolds and P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the validity of the mass concentration comparison for a class of nonlinear diffusion equations posed on Riemannian manifolds $ \mathbb{M}^n $ that are spherically symmetric, that is, model manifolds. The concentration comparison states that the solution of a certain diffusion equation that takes the radially decreasing (Schwarz) rearrangement $ u_0^\star $ as its initial datum is more concentrated than the original solution starting from $u_0$. This is known to hold in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a consequence of the celebrated P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, which asserts that the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of a function $f$ (belonging to an appropriate Sobolev space) is always larger than the $ L^2 $ norm of the gradient of its radially decreasing rearrangement $f^\star$. However, if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ is a general model manifold, it is not for granted that the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality holds; in fact, we will provide a simple condition involving the scalar curvature of $\mathbb{M}^n $ under which such an inequality actually fails. The main result we prove states that, given any continuous, nondecreasing, and nontrivial function $ \phi: [0,+\infty) \to [0,+\infty) $, the filtration equation $ \partial_t u = \Delta \phi(u) $ satisfies the concentration comparison in $ \mathbb{M}^n \times (0,+\infty) $ if and only if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality. In particular, the validity of such a comparison for the heat equation is sufficient to guarantee that the same holds for all filtration equations. Moreover, we prove that if $ \mathbb{M}^n $ supports a centered isoperimetric inequality then the P\'olya-Szeg\H{o} inequality, and thus the concentration comparison, holds. This allows us to include important examples such as the hyperbolic space and the sphere.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic properties of solutions to a nonlinear transmission problem for a Bresse beam with thermal damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear transmission problem for an arch beam, which consists of two parts with different material properties is considered. One of the parts is subjected to thermal damping while another one is undamped. The thermal damping affects only the shear angle and the longitudinal equation within the damped part, which can have any positive length. We prove the well-posedness of the system in the energy space and establish the existence of a compact global attractor under certain conditions imposed solely on the coefficients of the damped part. Additionally, we study singular limits of the system as the curvature of the beam tends to zero or in case both the curvature vanishes and the shear moduli tend to infinity. Numerical simulations are also carried out to model these limiting behaviors.</description>

      <title>Miminization of the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian with a small volume obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the well-known shape optimization problem with spectral cost: minimizing the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian among all subdomains $\Omega$ having prescribed volume and contained in a fixed box $D$; equivalently, we look for the best way to remove a compact set (obstacle) $K\subset\overline{D}$ of Lebesgue measure $|K|=\varepsilon$, $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;|D|$, in order to minimize the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the set $\Omega = D \setminus K$.
  In the small volume regime $\varepsilon\to0$, we prove that the optimal obstacles accumulate, in a suitable sense, to points of $\partial D$ where $|\nabla \phi_0|$ is minimal, where $\phi_0$ denotes the first eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian on $D$. Moreover, we provide a fairly detailed description of the convergence of the optimal eigenvalues, eigenfunctions and free boundaries. Our results are based on sharp estimates of the optimal eigenvalues, in terms of a suitable notion of relative capacity.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction in the Calder\'on problem on a fixed partition from finite and partial boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note modifies a reconstruction method by the author (Comm. PDE, 45(9):1118--1133, 2020), for reconstructing piecewise constant conductivities in the Calder\'on problem (electrical impedance tomography). In the former paper, a layering assumption and the local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map was needed since the piecewise constant partitioning also was assumed unknown. Here I show how to modify the method in case the partitioning is known, for general piecewise constant conductivities and only a finite number of partial boundary measurements. Moreover, no lower/upper bounds on the unknown conductivity are needed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky system with critical and sublinear terms \begin{equation*} \begin{cases}
  - \Delta u+ u+Q(x)\phi u= \vert u\vert^4 u+ \lambda K(x)\vert u \vert^{p-1}u&amp;\mbox{ in }\ \mathbb{R}^3 \smallskip
  - \Delta \phi+ a^{2}\Delta^{2} \phi = 4\pi Q(x) u^{2}&amp; \mbox{ in }\ \mathbb{R}^3. \end{cases} \end{equation*} Here $u,\phi:\mathbb {R}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are the unknowns, $Q$ and $K$ are given functions satisfying mild assumptions, $a\geq0, \lambda&gt;0$ are parameters and $p\in (0,1)$.
  We first show existence of infinitely many solutions at negative energy level, including the ground state, when the parameter $\lambda$ is small. Then
  we give general results concerning the structure of the set of solutions.
  We show also the behaviour of the solutions as the parameters $a,\lambda$ tend to zero. In particular the ground states solutions tends to a ground state solution of the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system as $a$ tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the eigenvalues of graph Laplacians on data clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given i.i.d.\ samples $X_n =\{ x_1, \dots, x_n \}$ from a distribution supported on a low dimensional manifold ${M}$ embedded in Eucliden space, we consider the graph Laplacian operator $\Delta_n$ associated to an $\varepsilon$-proximity graph over $X_n$ and study the asymptotic fluctuations of its eigenvalues around their means. In particular, letting $\hat{\lambda}_l^\varepsilon$ denote the $l$-th eigenvalue of $\Delta_n$, and under suitable assumptions on the data generating model and on the rate of decay of $\varepsilon$, we prove that $\sqrt{n } (\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon - \mathbb{E}[\hat{\lambda}_{l}^\varepsilon] )$ is asymptotically Gaussian with a variance that we can explicitly characterize. A formal argument allows us to interpret this asymptotic variance as the dissipation of a gradient flow of a suitable energy with respect to the Fisher-Rao geometry. This geometric interpretation allows us to give, in turn, a statistical interpretation of the asymptotic variance in terms of a Cramer-Rao lower bound for the estimation of the eigenvalues of certain weighted Laplace-Beltrami operator. The latter interpretation suggests a form of asymptotic statistical efficiency for the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian. We also present CLTs for multiple eigenvalues and through several numerical experiments explore the validity of our results when some of the assumptions that we make in our theoretical analysis are relaxed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that certain suitably renormalized value functions associated with the $d$-dimensional ($d\geq2$) $N$-body problem corresponding to different limiting shapes of expanding solutions, under the assumption that the center of mass is at the origin, are viscosity solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We analyze their singularities, defined as the initial configurations for which the minimizer of the associated variational problem is not unique. Moreover, we estimate the size of the closure of the singular set by proving its $\mathcal{H}^{d(N-1)-1}$-rectifiability, and we provide an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the set of regular conjugate points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Barenblatt solutions of the time-fractional porous medium equation, characterized by a Caputo-type time derivative. Employing an integral equation approach, we rigorously prove the existence of these solutions and establish several fundamental properties, including upper and lower estimates, mass conservation, regularity, and monotonicity. To bridge theory and practice, we introduce a family of convergent numerical schemes specifically designed to compute the Barenblatt solutions, ensuring reliable and efficient approximations. The theoretical framework is enriched with various examples that illustrate the concepts and validate the effectiveness of the proposed numerical methods, enhancing the understanding and applicability of our results.</description>

Abstract: We study the uniqueness of reaction-diffusion steady states in general domains with Dirichlet boundary data. Here we consider "positive" (monostable) reactions. We describe geometric conditions on the domain that ensure uniqueness and we provide complementary examples of nonuniqueness. Along the way, we formulate a number of open problems and conjectures. To derive our results, we develop a general framework, the stable-compact method, to study qualitative properties of nonlinear elliptic equations.</description>

Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for a specific class of time-fractional $\psi$-Caputo evolution systems with a derivative order ranging from 1 to 2 in Banach spaces. By using the properties of cosine and sine family operators, along with the generalized Laplace transform, we derive a more concise expression for the mild solution. This expression is formulated as an integral, incorporating Mainardi's Wright-type function. Furthermore, we provide various valuable properties associated with the operators present in the mild solution. Additionally, employing the fixed-point technique and Gr\"{o}nwall's inequality, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution. To illustrate our results, we conclude with an example of a time-fractional equation, presenting the expression for its corresponding mild solution.</description>

      <title>Local interpolation techniques for higher-order singular perturbations of non-convex functionals: free-discontinuity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general approach, using local interpolation inequalities, to non-convex integral functionals depending on the gradient with a singular perturbation by derivatives of order $k\ge 2$. When applied to functionals giving rise to free-discontinuity energies, such methods permit to change boundary values for derivatives up to order $k-1$ in problems defining density functions for the jump part, thus allowing to prove optimal-profile formulas, and to deduce compactness and lower bounds. As an application, we prove that for $k$-th order perturbations of energies depending on the gradient behaving as a constant at infinity, the jump energy density is a constant $m_k$ times the $k$-th root of the jump size. The result is first proved for truncated quadratic energy densities and in the one-dimensional case, from which the general higher-dimensional case can be obtained by slicing techniques. A wide class of non-convex energies can be studied as an envelope of these particular ones. Finally, we remark that an approximation of the Mumford-Shah functional can be obtained by letting $k$ tend to infinity. We also derive a new approximation of the Blake-Zisserman functional.</description>

      <title>$L^{p}$ Mild Solution to Stochastic Incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global $L^{p}$ mild solution of inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the torus $\mathbb{T}^{N}$ with $N&lt;p&lt;6$, $ 1 \leqslant N \leqslant 3$, driven by the Wiener Process. We introduce a new iteration scheme coupled the density $\rho$ and the velocity $\mathbf{u}$ to linearize the system, which defines a semigroup. Notably, unlike semigroups dependent solely on $x$, the generators of this semigroup depend on both time $t$ and space $x$. After demonstrating the properties of this time- and space-dependent semigroup, we prove the local existence and uniqueness of mild solution, employing the semigroup theory and Banach's fixed point theorem. Finally, we show the global existence of mild solutions by Zorn's lemma. Moreover, for the stochastic case, we need to use the operator splitting method to do some estimates separately.</description>

Abstract: We construct nonradial, self-similar solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations without assuming rotational symmetry. These solutions extend the study of self-similar algebraic spiral flows, initiated by Elling and further developed by Shao-Wei-Zhang [41], where m-fold symmetry with m&gt;=2 was assumed. Moreover, they bear resemblance to the numerical simulations of Bressan-Shen [10], in connection with the ongoing investigation into non-uniqueness of solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the regularization by nonlinear noise for a class of partial differential equations that may only have local solutions. In particular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to a longstanding open problem in this field.
  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications, including stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic surface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>
