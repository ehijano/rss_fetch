      <title>Magnetic field breakout in ultramassive crystallizing white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultramassive white dwarfs with masses $M\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ probe extreme physics near the Chandrasekhar limit. Despite the rapid increase in observations, it is still unclear how many harbour carbon-oxygen (CO) versus oxygen-neon (ONe) cores. The origin of these white dwarfs and their strong magnetic fields - single stellar evolution or a stellar merger - is another open question. The steep mass-radius relation of the relativistic ultramassive white dwarfs shortens their crystallization time $t_{\rm cryst}$, such that the recently proposed crystallization dynamo mechanism may present an alternative to mergers in explaining the early appearance of magnetism in the observed population. However, the magnetic diffusion time from the convective dynamo to the white dwarf's surface delays the magnetic field's breakout time $t_{\rm break}&gt;t_{\rm cryst}$. We compute $t_{\rm break}(M)$ for CO and ONe ultramassive white dwarfs and compare it to the local 40 pc volume-limited sample. We find that the breakout time from CO cores is too long to account for the observations. ONe crystallization dynamos remain a viable option, but their surrounding non-convective envelopes comprise only a few per cent of the total mass, such that $t_{\rm break}$ is highly sensitive to the details of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>Small-scale and large-scale dynamos in global convection simulations of solar-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that a small-scale dynamo (SSD) instability could be possible in solar-like low magnetic Prandtl number Pm plasmas. It has been proposed that the presence of SSD can potentially have a significant impact on the dynamics of the large-scale dynamo (LSD) in the stellar convection zones. Studying these two dynamos, SSD and LSD, together in a global magnetoconvection model requires high-resolution simulations and large amounts of computational resources. Starting from a well-studied global convective dynamo model that produces cyclic magnetic fields, we systematically increased the resolution and lowered the diffusivities to enter the regime of Reynolds numbers that allow for the excitation of SSD on top of the LSD. We studied how the properties of convection, generated differential rotation profiles, and LSD solutions change with the presence of SSD. We performed convective dynamo simulations in a spherical wedge with the Pencil Code. The resolutions of the models were increased in 4 steps by a total factor of 16 to achieve maximal fluid and magnetic Reynolds numbers of over 500. We found that the differential rotation is strongly quenched by the presence of the LSD and SSD. Even though the small-scale magnetic field only mildly decreases increasing Re, the large-scale field strength decreases significantly. We do not find the SSD dynamo significantly quenching the convective flows as claimed recently by other authors; in contrast, the convective flows first grow and then saturate for increasing Re. Furthermore, the angular momentum transport is highly affected by the presence of small-scale magnetic fields, which are mostly generated by LSD. These fields not only change the Reynolds stresses, but also generate dynamically important Maxwell stresses. The LSD evolution in terms of its pattern and field distribution is rather independent of the increase in Rm.</description>

      <title>Ups and downs in the X-ray emission of the colliding wind binaries HD 168112 and HD 167971</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-period O-star binary system HD 168112 and the triple O-star system HD 167971 are well-known sources of non-thermal radio emission that arises from a colliding wind interaction. The wind-wind collisions in these systems should result in phase-dependent X-ray emissions. The presence of a population of relativistic electrons in the wind interaction zone could affect the properties of the X-ray emission and make it deviate from the behaviour expected for adiabatic shocks. We investigate the X-ray emission of these systems with the goals of quantifying the fraction of the X-ray flux arising from wind interactions and determining whether these emissions follow the predictions for adiabatic wind-wind collisions. Six X-ray observations were collected with XMM-Newton. Three observations were scheduled around the most recent periastron passage of HD 168112. Spectra and light curves were analysed and compared with simple predictions of model calculations for X-ray emission from colliding wind systems. The X-ray emission of HD 168112 varies as the inverse of the orbital separation, as expected for an adiabatic wind interaction zone. The relative contribution of intrinsic X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks varies between 38% at periastron to 81% at apastron. The wind-wind collision zone remains adiabatic even around periastron passage. The X-ray emission of HD 167971 displays variations on the orbital timescale of the inner eclipsing binary. The existing data of this system do not allow us to probe variations on the timescale of the outer orbit. Shock modification due to the action of relativistic electrons does not seem to be efficiently operating in the HD 168112 system. In the existing observations, a significant part of the emission of HD 167971 must arise in the inner eclipsing binary. The origin of this emission is as yet unclear.</description>

      <title>An improved asteroseismic age of the rapid rotator Altair from TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the effects of rotation in stellar evolution is key to modelling early-type stars, half of which have equatorial velocities over 100 km/s. The nearby star Altair is an example of such fast-rotating stars, and furthermore, it has the privilege of being modelled by a detailed 2D concordance model that reproduces most of its observables. The aim of this paper is to include new asteroseismic frequencies to improve our knowledge of Altair, especially its age. We processed images of Altair obtained during July 2022 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite using the halo photometry technique to obtain its light curve over this observation period. By analysing the light curve, we derived a set of 22 new frequencies in the oscillation spectrum of Altair and confirmed 12 previously known frequencies. Compared with model predictions, we could associate ten frequencies with ten axisymmetric modes. This identification is based on the modelled visibility of the modes. Moreover, nine of the modelled frequencies can be adjusted to simultaneously match their corresponding observed frequencies, once the core hydrogen mass fraction of the concordance model is set to $X_{\rm core}/X_{\rm ini}\simeq0.972$, with $X_{\rm ini}=0.739$. Using the combined results of a 1D MESA model computing the pre-main sequence and a 2D time-dependent ESTER model computing the main sequence, we find that this core hydrogen abundance sets the age of Altair to 88$\pm$10 Myrs, which is slightly younger than previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Modelling the magnetic vectors of ICMEs at different heliocentric distances with INFROS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The INterplanetary Flux ROpe Simulator (INFROS) is an observationally constrained analytical model dedicated for forecasting the strength of the southward component (Bz) of the magnetic field embedded in interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). In this work, we validate the model for six ICMEs sequentially observed by two radially-aligned spacecraft positioned at different heliocentric distances. The six selected ICMEs in this study comprise of cases associated with isolated CME evolution as well as those interacting with high-speed streams (HSS) and high-density streams (HDS). For the isolated CMEs, our results show that the model outputs at both the spacecraft are in good agreement with in-situ observations. However, for most of the interacting events, the model correctly captures the CME evolution only at the inner spacecraft. Due to the interaction with HSS and HDS, which in most cases occurred at heliocentric distances beyond the inner spacecraft, the ICME evolution no longer remains self-similar. Consequently, the model underestimates the field strength at the outer spacecraft. Our findings indicate that constraining the INFROS model with inner spacecraft observations significantly enhances the prediction accuracy at the outer spacecraft for the three events undergoing self-similar expansion, achieving a 90 % correlation between observed and predicted Bz profiles. This work also presents a quantitative estimation of the ICME magnetic field enhancement due to interaction which may lead to severe space weather. We conclude that the assumption of self-similar expansion provides a lower limit to the magnetic field strength estimated at any heliocentric distance, based on the remote sensing observations.</description>

      <title>Jet formation in post-AGB binaries: Confronting cold magnetohydrodynamic disc wind wind models with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We consider cold self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc wind solutions to describe jets launching from the circumcompanion accretion discs in post-AGB binaries. Resulting predictions are matched to observations for five different post-AGB binaries. This both tests the physical validity of the MHD disc wind paradigm and reveals the accretion disc properties.
  Results: Many of the time-series' properties are reproduced well by the models, though systematic mismatches, such as overestimated rotation, remain. Four targets imply accretion discs that reach close to the secondary's stellar surface, while one is fitted with an unrealistically large inner radius of about 20 stellar radii. Some fits imply inner disc temperatures over 10 000 K, seemingly discrepant with a previous observational estimate from H band interferometry. This estimate is, however, shown to be biased. Fitted mass-accretion rates range from about 10^-6 to 10^-3 solar masses per year. Relative to jets launched from young stellar objects (YSOs), all targets prefer winds with higher ejection efficiencies, lower magnetizations and thicker discs.
  Conclusions: Our models show that current cold MHD disc wind solutions can explain many of the jet-related Balmer alpha features seen in post-AGB binaries, though systematic discrepancies remain. This includes, but is not limited to, overestimated rotation and underestimated post-AGB circumbinary disc lifetimes. The consideration of thicker discs and the inclusion of irradiation from the post-AGB primary, leading to warm magnetothermal wind launching, might alleviate these.</description>

      <title>Whispering in the dark: faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection, plasmoids and numerical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining fast magnetic reconnection in electrically conducting plasmas has been a theoretical challenge in plasma physics since its first description by Eugene N. Parker. In the recent years the observed reconnection rate has been shown by numerical simulations to be explained by the plasmoid instability that appears in highly conductive plasmas. In this work we show that the plasmoid instability is very sensitive to the numerical resolution used. It is shown that well resolved runs display no plasmoid instability even at Lundquist number as large as $5\cdot10^5$ achieved at resolutions of $32\,768^2$ grid points. On the contrary in simulations that are under-resolved below a threshold, the plasmoid instability manifests itself with the formation of larger plasmoids the larger the under-resolving is. The present results thus question the description of the plasmoid instability as a mechanism for fast magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way as seen by Classical Cepheids I: distances based on mid-infrared photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are the archetype of the standard candle, thanks to the period-luminosity relation which allows to measure their intrinsic brightness. They are also relatively young and bright, potentially making them excellent tracers of the young stellar population that is responsible for shaping the visible aspect of our Galaxy, the Milky Way. However, being observers embedded in the dusty interstellar medium of the Galaxy, deriving reliable photometric distances to classical Cepheids of the Milky Way is a challenge. The typical approach is to use reddening-free indices, such as Wesenheit magnitudes, to obviate the need for an extinction correction. However, this approach is not reliable - especially toward the inner Galaxy - as its assumption of a universal total-to-selective extinction ratio is not satisfied, particularly in lines-of-sight where the extinction is high and crosses spiral arms. We instead estimate new distances for 3425 Cepheids based on mid-IR photometry from WISE, which suffers minimally from extinction, and by adopting a 3D extinction map to calculate the necessary (albeit small) extinction corrections. We show that our distances are consistent with Gaia's parallaxes for the subset with relative parallax errors smaller than 10%, verifying that our mean distance errors are of the order of 13% and that the mean parallax zero point for this subsample is 7 $\mu$as. The catalog of Cepheid distances is made available online.</description>

      <title>Boil-off of red supergiants: mass loss and type II-P supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass loss mechanism of red supergiant stars is not well understood, even though it has crucial consequences for their stellar evolution and the appearance of supernovae that occur upon core-collapse. We argue that outgoing shock waves launched near the photosphere can support a dense chromosphere between the star's surface and the dust formation radius at several stellar radii. We derive analytic expressions for the time-averaged density profile of the chromosphere, and we use these to estimate mass loss rates due to winds launched by radiation pressure at the dust formation radius. These mass loss rates are similar to recent observations, possibly explaining the upward kink in mass loss rates of luminous red supergiants. Our models predict that low-mass red supergiants lose less mass than commonly assumed, while high-mass red supergiants lose more. The chromospheric mass of our models is $\sim$0.01 solar masses, most of which lies within a few stellar radii. This can help explain the early light curves and spectra of type-II P supernovae without requiring extreme pre-supernova mass loss. We discuss implications for stellar evolution, type II-P supernovae, SN 2023ixf, and Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: No sign of multiple stellar populations in open clusters from their sodium and oxygen abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The light element (anti-)correlations shown by globular clusters (GCs) are the main spectroscopic signature of multiple stellar populations. These internal abundance variations provide us with fundamental constraints on the formation mechanism of stellar clusters. Aims: Using Gaia-ESO, the largest and most homogeneous survey of open clusters (OCs), we intend to check whether these stellar aggregates display the same patterns. Based on previous studies of many GCs, several young and massive clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, as well as a few OCs, we do not expect to find any anti-correlation, given the low mass of Milky Way OCs. Methods: We used the results based on UVES spectra of stars in Gaia-ESO to derive the distribution of Na and O abundances and seevwhether they show an unexplained dispersion or whether they are anti-correlated. By selecting only high-probability members with high-precision stellar parameters, we ended up with more than 700 stars in 74 OCs. We examined the O-Na distribution in 28 OCsvwith at least 4 stars available as well as the Na distribution in 24 OCs, with at least 10 stars available. Results: We find that the distribution of Na abundances is compatible with a single-value population, within the errors. The fewvapparent exceptions can be explained by differences in the evolutionary phase (main sequence and giant post first dredge-up episode) or by difficulties in analysing low gravity giants. We did not find any indication of an Na-O anti-correlation in any of the clusters for which O has been derived. Conclusions: Based on the very small spread we find, OCs maintain the status of single stellar populations. However, a definitive answer requires studying more elements and larger samples covering different evolutionary phases. This will be possible with the next generation of large surveys</description>

      <title>The extreme coronal line emitter AT 2022fpx: Varying optical polarization properties and late-time X-ray flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes disrupt passing stars, producing outbursts called tidal disruption events (TDEs). TDEs have recently gained attention due to their unique dynamics and emission processes, which are still not fully understood. Especially, the so-called optical TDEs, are of interest as they often exhibit delayed or obscured X-ray emission from the accretion disk, making the origin of the prompt emission unclear. In this paper, we present multiband optical polarization observations and optical spectrometry of a recent TDE candidate AT 2022fpx, alongside monitoring observations in optical, ultraviolet and X-rays. The optical spectra of AT 2022fpx show Bowen fluorescence as well as highly-ionized iron emission lines, which are characteristic of extreme coronal line emitters. Additionally, the source exhibits variable but low-polarized continuum emission at the outburst peak, with a clear rotation of the polarization angle. X-ray emission observed approximately 250 days after the outburst peak in the decay appear flare-like but is consistent with constant temperature black-body emission. The overall outburst decay is slower than for typical TDEs, and resembles more the ones seen from Bowen fluorescence flares. These observations suggest that AT 2022fpx could be a key source in linking different long-lived TDE scenarios. Its unique characteristics, such as extreme coronal line emission, variable polarization, and delayed X-ray flare, can be attributed to the outer shock scenario or a clumpy torus surrounding the supermassive black hole. Further studies, especially in the context of multi-wavelength observations, are crucial to fully understand the dynamics and emission mechanisms of these intriguing astrophysical events.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of slow diffusion regions as the origin for extended TeV emission halos around some pulsars (such as PSR J0633+1746 and PSR B0656+14) challenges the standard scaling of the electron diffusion coefficient in the interstellar medium. Self-generated turbulence by electron-positron pairs streaming out of the pulsar wind nebula was proposed as a possible mechanism to produce the enhanced turbulence required to explain the morphology and brightness of these TeV halos. We perform fully kinetic 1D3V particle-in-cell simulations of this instability, considering the case where streaming electrons and positrons have the same density. This implies purely resonant instability as the beam does not carry any current. We compare the linear phase of the instability with analytical theory and find very reasonable agreement. The non-linear phase of the instability is also studied, which reveals that the intensity of saturated waves is consistent with a momentum exchange criterion between a decelerating beam and growing magnetic waves. With the adopted parameters, the instability-driven wavemodes cover both the Alfv\'enic (fluid) and kinetic scales. The spectrum of the produced waves is non-symmetric, with left-handed circular polarisation waves being strongly damped when entering the ion-cyclotron branch, while right-handed waves are suppressed at smaller wavelength when entering the Whistler branch. The low-wavenumber part of the spectrum remains symmetric when in the Alfv\'enic branch. As a result, positrons behave dynamically differently compared to electrons. We also observed a second harmonic plasma emission in the wave spectrum. An MHD-PIC approach is warranted to probe hotter beams and investigate the Alfv\'en branch physics. This work confirms that the self-confinement scenario develops essentially according to analytical expectations [...](abridged)</description>
