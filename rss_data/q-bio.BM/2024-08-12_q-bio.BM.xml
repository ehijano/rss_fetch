      <title>Acto-myosin clusters as active units shaping living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stress generation by the actin cytoskeleton shapes cells and tissues. Despite impressive progress in live imaging and quantitative physical descriptions of cytoskeletal network dynamics, the connection between processes at molecular scales and cell-scale spatio-temporal patterns is still unclear. Here we review studies reporting acto-myosin clusters of micrometer size and with lifetimes of several minutes in a large number of organisms ranging from fission yeast to humans. Such structures have also been found in reconstituted systems in vitro and in theoretical analysis of cytoskeletal dynamics. We propose that tracking these clusters can serve as a simple readout for characterising living matter. Spatio-temporal patterns of clusters could serve as determinants of morphogenetic processes that play similar roles in diverse organisms.</description>

      <title>Cell Morphology-Guided Small Molecule Generation with GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-content phenotypic screening, including high-content imaging (HCI), has gained popularity in the last few years for its ability to characterize novel therapeutics without prior knowledge of the protein target. When combined with deep learning techniques to predict and represent molecular-phenotype interactions, these advancements hold the potential to significantly accelerate and enhance drug discovery applications. This work focuses on the novel task of HCI-guided molecular design. Generative models for molecule design could be guided by HCI data, for example with a supervised model that links molecules to phenotypes of interest as a reward function. However, limited labeled data, combined with the high-dimensional readouts, can make training these methods challenging and impractical. We consider an alternative approach in which we leverage an unsupervised multimodal joint embedding to define a latent similarity as a reward for GFlowNets. The proposed model learns to generate new molecules that could produce phenotypic effects similar to those of the given image target, without relying on pre-annotated phenotypic labels. We demonstrate that the proposed method generates molecules with high morphological and structural similarity to the target, increasing the likelihood of similar biological activity, as confirmed by an independent oracle model.</description>

      <title>CREMP: Conformer-rotamer ensembles of macrocyclic peptides for machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational and machine learning approaches to model the conformational landscape of macrocyclic peptides have the potential to enable rational design and optimization. However, accurate, fast, and scalable methods for modeling macrocycle geometries remain elusive. Recent deep learning approaches have significantly accelerated protein structure prediction and the generation of small-molecule conformational ensembles, yet similar progress has not been made for macrocyclic peptides due to their unique properties. Here, we introduce CREMP, a resource generated for the rapid development and evaluation of machine learning models for macrocyclic peptides. CREMP contains 36,198 unique macrocyclic peptides and their high-quality structural ensembles generated using the Conformer-Rotamer Ensemble Sampling Tool (CREST). Altogether, this new dataset contains nearly 31.3 million unique macrocycle geometries, each annotated with energies derived from semi-empirical extended tight-binding (xTB) DFT calculations. Additionally, we include 3,258 macrocycles with reported passive permeability data to couple conformational ensembles to experiment. We anticipate that this dataset will enable the development of machine learning models that can improve peptide design and optimization for novel therapeutics.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for coarse grained molecular dynamics of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17513v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein dynamics is crucial for elucidating their biological functions. While all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide detailed information, coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations capture the essential collective motions of proteins at significantly lower computational cost. In this article, we present a unified framework for coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of proteins. Our approach utilizes a tree-structured representation of collective variables, enabling reconstruction of protein Cartesian coordinates with high fidelity. The evolution of configurations is constructed using a deep neural network trained on trajectories generated from conventional all-atom MD simulations. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness using the 168-amino protein target T1027 from CASP14. Statistical distributions of the collective variables and time series of root mean square deviation (RMSD) obtained from our coarse-grained simulations closely resemble those from all-atom MD simulations. This method is not only useful for studying the movements of complex proteins, but also has the potential to be adapted for simulating other biomolecules like DNA, RNA, and even electrolytes in batteries.</description>
