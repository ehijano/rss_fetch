      <title>Gene regulatory network inference algorithm based on spectral signed directed graph convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately reconstructing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) is crucial for understanding gene functions and disease mechanisms. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology provides vast data for computational GRN reconstruction. Since GRNs are ideally modeled as signed directed graphs to capture activation/inhibition relationships, the most intuitive and reasonable approach is to design feature extractors based on the topological structure of GRNs to extract structural features, then combine them with biological characteristics for research. However, traditional spectral graph convolution struggles with this representation. Thus, we propose MSGRNLink, a novel framework that explicitly models GRNs as signed directed graphs and employs magnetic signed Laplacian convolution. Experiments across simulated and real datasets demonstrate that MSGRNLink outperforms all baseline models in AUROC. Parameter sensitivity analysis and ablation studies confirmed its robustness and the importance of each module. In a bladder cancer case study, MSGRNLink predicted more known edges and edge signs than benchmark models, further validating its biological relevance.</description>

      <title>Understanding Cellular Noise with Optical Perturbation and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise plays a crucial role in the regulation of cellular and organismal function and behavior.
  Exploring noise's impact is key to understanding fundamental biological processes, such as gene expression, signal transduction, and the mechanisms of development and evolution.
  Currently, a comprehensive method to quantify dynamical behavior of cellular noise within these biochemical systems is lacking.
  In this study, we introduce an optically-controlled perturbation system utilizing the light-sensitive Phytochrome B (PhyB) from \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}, which enables precise noise modulation with high spatial-temporal resolution.
  Our system exhibits exceptional sensitivity to light, reacting consistently to pulsed light signals, distinguishing it from other photoreceptor-based promoter systems that respond to a single light wavelength.
  To characterize our system, we developed a stochastic model for phytochromes that accounts for photoactivation/deactivation, thermal reversion, and the dynamics of the light-activated gene promoter system.
  To precisely control our system, we determined the rate constants for this model using an omniscient deep neural network that can directly map rate constant combinations to time-dependent state joint distributions.
  By adjusting the activation rates through light intensity and degradation rates via N-terminal mutagenesis, we illustrate that out optical-controlled perturbation can effectively modulate molecular expression level as well as noise.
  Our results highlight the potential of employing an optically-controlled gene perturbation system as a noise-controlled stimulus source.
  This approach, when combined with the analytical capabilities of a sophisticated deep neural network, enables the accurate estimation of rate constants from observational data in a broad range of biochemical reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00696v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping computational and network biology by enabling new approaches to decode cellular communication networks. We introduce Hierarchical Molecular Language Models (HMLMs), a novel framework that models cellular signaling as a specialized molecular language, where signaling molecules function as tokens, protein interactions define syntax, and functional consequences constitute semantics. HMLMs employ a transformer-based architecture adapted to accommodate graph-structured signaling networks through information transducers, mathematical entities that capture how molecules receive, process, and transmit signals. The architecture integrates multi-modal data sources across molecular, pathway, and cellular scales through hierarchical attention mechanisms and scale-bridging operators that enable information flow across biological hierarchies. Applied to a complex network of cardiac fibroblast signaling, HMLMs outperformed traditional approaches in temporal dynamics prediction, particularly under sparse sampling conditions. Attention-based analysis revealed biologically meaningful crosstalk patterns, including previously uncharacterized interactions between signaling pathways. By bridging molecular mechanisms with cellular phenotypes through AI-driven molecular language representation, HMLMs establish a foundation for biology-oriented large language models (LLMs) that could be pre-trained on comprehensive pathway datasets and applied across diverse signaling systems and tissues, advancing precision medicine and therapeutic discovery.</description>

      <title>Tracking large chemical reaction networks and rare events by neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks are widely used to model stochastic dynamics in chemical kinetics, systems biology and epidemiology. Solving the chemical master equation that governs these systems poses a significant challenge due to the large state space exponentially growing with system sizes. The development of autoregressive neural networks offers a flexible framework for this problem; however, its efficiency is limited especially for high-dimensional systems and in scenarios with rare events. Here, we push the frontier of neural-network approach by exploiting faster optimizations such as natural gradient descent and time-dependent variational principle, achieving a 5- to 22-fold speedup, and by leveraging enhanced-sampling strategies to capture rare events. We demonstrate reduced computational cost and higher accuracy over the previous neural-network method in challenging reaction networks, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade network, the hitherto largest biological network handled by the previous approaches of solving the chemical master equation. We further apply the approach to spatially extended reaction-diffusion systems, the Schl\"ogl model with rare events, on two-dimensional lattices, beyond the recent tensor-network approach that handles one-dimensional lattices. The present approach thus enables efficient modeling of chemical reaction networks in general.</description>

      <title>Decoding and Engineering the Phytobiome Communication for Smart Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart agriculture applications, integrating technologies like the Internet of Things and machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI) into agriculture, hold promise to address modern challenges of rising food demand, environmental pollution, and water scarcity. Alongside the concept of the phytobiome, which defines the area including the plant, its environment, and associated organisms, and the recent emergence of molecular communication (MC), there exists an important opportunity to advance agricultural science and practice using communication theory. In this article, we motivate to use the communication engineering perspective for developing a holistic understanding of the phytobiome communication and bridge the gap between the phytobiome communication and smart agriculture. Firstly, an overview of phytobiome communication via molecular and electrophysiological signals is presented and a multi-scale framework modeling the phytobiome as a communication network is conceptualized. Then, how this framework is used to model electrophysiological signals is demonstrated with plant experiments. Furthermore, possible smart agriculture applications, such as smart irrigation and targeted delivery of agrochemicals, through engineering the phytobiome communication are proposed. These applications merge ML/AI methods with the Internet of Bio-Nano-Things enabled by MC and pave the way towards more efficient, sustainable, and eco-friendly agricultural production. Finally, the implementation challenges, open research issues, and industrial outlook for these applications are discussed.</description>
