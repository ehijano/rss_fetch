      <title>Market-Based Variance of Market Portfolio and of Entire Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the unified market-based description of returns and variances of the trades with shares of a particular security, of the trades with shares of all securities in the market, and of the trades with the market portfolio. We consider the investor who doesn't trade the shares of his portfolio he collected at time t0 in the past. The investor observes the time series of the current trades with all securities made in the market during the averaging interval. The investor may convert these time series into the time series that model the trades with all securities as the trades with a single security and into the time series that model the trades with the market portfolio as the trades with a single security. That establishes the same description of the returns and variances of the trades with a single security, the trades with all securities in the market, and the market portfolio. We show that the market-based variance, which accounts for the impact of random change of the volumes of consecutive trades with securities, takes the form of Markowitz's (1952) portfolio variance if the volumes of consecutive trades with all market securities are assumed constant. That highlights that Markowitz's (1952) variance ignores the effects of random volumes of consecutive trades. We compare the market-based variances of the market portfolio and of the trades with all market securities, consider the importance of the duration of the averaging interval, and explain the economic obstacles that limit the accuracy of the predictions of the returns and variances at best by Gaussian distributions. The same methods describe the returns and variances of any portfolio and the trades with its securities.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of emissions Markets: A Discrete-Time Radner Equilibrium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emissions markets play a vital role in emissions reduction by incentivizing firms to minimize costs. However, their effectiveness heavily depends on the decisions of policymakers, future economic activity, and the availability of abatement technologies. This study investigates how variations in regulatory standards, firms' abatement costs, and emission levels influence allowance prices and firms' abatement efforts. This is done in a Radner equilibrium framework that incorporates intertemporal decision-making and uncertainty, enabling a comprehensive analysis of market dynamics and outcomes. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers aiming to enhance the design and efficiency of emissions trading systems through a deeper understanding of stakeholder responses across varying market conditions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Illicit Account Detection in Ethereum DeFi Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. This growth, however, is accompanied by significant security risks such as illicit accounts engaged in fraud. Effective detection is further limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious accounts. To address these challenges with a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem, we propose $\textbf{SLEID}$, a $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{L}$earning $\textbf{E}$nsemble-based $\textbf{I}$llicit account $\textbf{D}$etection framework. SLEID uses an Isolation Forest model for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, enhancing detection accuracy. Experiments on 6,903,860 Ethereum transactions with extensive DeFi interaction coverage demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms supervised and semi-supervised baselines with $\textbf{+2.56}$ percentage-point precision, comparable recall, and $\textbf{+0.90}$ percentage-point F1 -- particularly for the minority illicit class -- alongside $\textbf{+3.74}$ percentage-points higher accuracy and improvements in PR-AUC, while substantially reducing reliance on labeled data.</description>
