      <title>Mapping the Optical Landscape of a Squaraine Molecule in the Visible and Ultraviolet Energy Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although squaraine dyes are commonly praised as candidates for light-based applications, little is known about their excited state landscape beyond the low-energy visible light region. Our work aims for an improved understanding of the photophysical properties of squaraines at the example of N-isobutyl substituted anilino-squaraine (SQIB) by extending ground-state and excited-state absorption spectroscopy of the molecule into the ultraviolet up to 6.5~eV. In addition, we distinguish the relative transition dipole moments of the excited state absorption peaks with the help of transient absorption anisotropy experiments. To relate experimental features to specific states, we employ a set of ab initio methods including time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and n-electron valence perturbation theory on top of a self-consistent complete active space (CASSCF/NEVPT2). Our assignment is complemented by vibronic simulations and a discussion of two-photon absorption measurements. Through this joint effort, we are able to provide a consistent picture of the optical behavior of SQIB across the visible and ultraviolet light regime, and assign a total of twelve electronically excited states to our experimental data.</description>

      <title>Electrodrying in nanopores: from fundamentals to iontronic and memristive applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iontronics is a burgeoning paradigm that employs ions in solution as information carriers for sensing and computing, e.g., in neuromorphic devices. The fundamentally different working principle as compared to electronics requires novel approaches and concepts to control the impedance of nanoscale fluidic circuit elements, such as nanopores. For instance, previous research has focused on voltage-induced pore wetting as a means to trigger conduction in nanopores. The present study explores the opposite counter-intuitive mechanism: using voltage to dry hydrophobic nanopores and, therefore, to turn off conduction. This "electrodrying" concept affords exquisite, bidirectional control over the conductance of nanopores additionally showing hysteresis in the current-voltage curve that is the fingerprint of memristors. Using an analytical model and free-energy molecular dynamics simulations, we explain the physical mechanism underlying electrodrying and provide clear design criteria for solid-state and biological nanopores with bidirectional control over conductance. The electrical behaviour of electrodrying nanopores shows two unique features: i) the hysteresis loop is shifted from the origin, accounting for the fifth, previously unreported memristor type and ii) negative differential resistance is observed over a broad voltage range in which the non-conductive state is favoured by electrodrying. These properties are demonstrated in a short-term memory task and in an iontronic oscillator circuit to showcase their potential in neuromorphic applications and iontronic devices. Finally, we validate our predictions through experiments on engineered dipolar hydrophobic CytK nanopores, whose voltage-dependent conductance substantiates the electrodrying concept.</description>

      <title>On the Boroxol Ring Fraction in Melt-Quenched B$_2$O$_3$ Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An atomistic structural model for melt-quenched B$_2$O$_3$ glass has eluded the simulation community so far. The difficulty lies in the abundance of the six-membered boroxol rings - an intermediate-range order motif suggested through Raman and NMR spectroscopy - which is challenging to obtain in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we report the development of a DFT-accurate machine-learned potential for B$_2$O$_3$ and employ quench rates as low as 10$^{9}$ K/s to obtain B$_2$O$_3$ glasses with more than 30% of boron atoms in boroxol rings. Also, we show that the pressure, and consequently the boroxol fraction, in the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations critically depends on the range of the geometry descriptor used in the embedding neural network, and at least a 9 $\unicode{x212B}$ range is required. The boroxol ring fraction increases with decreasing quench rate. Finally, amorphous B$_2$O$_3$ configurations display a minimum in energy at a boroxol fraction of 75%, intriguingly close to the experimental estimate in B$_2$O$_3$ glass.</description>

      <title>Accurate bandgaps of photovoltaic kesterites from first-principles DFT+U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streamlined prediction of the electronic properties of photoactive materials warrants a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach that (i) yields reliable bandgaps, (ii) is free of empirically tuned parameters, and (iii) exhibits low computational overhead. Here we show that for Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnGeS4 kesterite photovoltaic materials, all three of these demands are met by the DFT plus Hubbard U technique (DFT+U) with corrective parameters evaluated via minimum-tracking linear response. The predicted bandgaps are found to even marginally outperform those from the self-consistent GW approach. Key to this method's success is the application of Hubbard U corrections to all atomic subspaces that dominate the conduction and valence band edges, as opposed to the conventional approach of correcting 3d and 4f atomic states. Intriguingly, the inclusion of Hund's J corrections via the extended DFT+U+J functional significantly worsens these results. This under performance can be ameliorated through the use of the Burgess-Linscott-O'Regan (BLOR) flat-plane based Hubbard U plus Hund's J functional, with bandgap predictions in close agreement with the conventional DFT+U method. The DFT+U method is also used to predict defect-induced changes to the bandgap and associated formation energies, in 1,728-atom supercells.</description>

      <title>Quantized plasmon modes for metallic nanoparticles of arbitrary shape with a generic dielectric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce an effective approach to quantize the electromagnetic response of plasmonic metallic nanostructures. Their shape is arbitrary and they feature a realistic description of the frequency-dependent metal dielectric function that is based on experimental data. The derived quantum modes correctly reproduce the linear response macroscopic polarization of the nanoparticle upon external drive according to classical macroscopic Maxwell equations in the quasistatic limit. Such methodology paves the way for accurate modeling of plexcitonic system, where strong plasmon-molecule coupling and/or strong-driving fields call for a quantized description of the plasmonic response.</description>
