      <title>CogniQ-H: A Soft Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Paradigm for Automated Data Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior, generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive, evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to 13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.</description>

      <title>LLaPipe: LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Automated Data Preparation Pipeline Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy (Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that LLaPipe achieves up to 22.4\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.3$\times$ faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods, while maintaining computational efficiency through selective LLM usage (averaging only 19.0\% of total exploration steps).</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Self-Healing Databases Using Meta-Learning and Dependency-Driven Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explored the development of a novel self-healing framework for databases using meta-learning and reinforcement learning techniques. The primary objective was to address the challenges of real-time adaptability and minimal retraining in dynamic workload environments. The proposed approach integrated Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) with reinforcement learning to enable anomaly detection and corrective actions that adapted swiftly to evolving database conditions. Multi-objective optimization was employed to balance performance, resource utilization, and cost efficiency during the healing process. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were incorporated to model interdependencies within database components, ensuring holistic recovery strategies. Data efficiency was enhanced through synthetic task augmentation and self-supervised learning, enabling effective training in sparse data regimes. To promote trust and transparency, explainable AI techniques were integrated to provide interpretable insights into anomaly detection and healing actions. Federated meta-learning further enabled privacy-preserving adaptability in distributed database environments. The framework demonstrated significant improvements in adaptability, efficiency, and reliability, contributing to advancements in database management and self-healing systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Next Generation Data Engineering Pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data engineering pipelines are a widespread way to provide high-quality data for all kinds of data science applications. However, numerous challenges still remain in the composition and operation of such pipelines. Data engineering pipelines do not always deliver high-quality data. By default, they are also not reactive to changes. When new data is coming in which deviates from prior data, the pipeline could crash or output undesired results. We therefore envision three levels of next generation data engineering pipelines: optimized data pipelines, self-aware data pipelines, and self-adapting data pipelines. Pipeline optimization addresses the composition of operators and their parametrization in order to achieve the highest possible data quality. Self-aware data engineering pipelines enable a continuous monitoring of its current state, notifying data engineers on significant changes. Self-adapting data engineering pipelines are then even able to automatically react to those changes. We propose approaches to achieve each of these levels.</description>

      <title>Project-connex Decompositions and Tractability of Aggregate Group-by Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce 'project-connex' tree-width as a measure of tractability for counting and aggregate conjunctive queries over semirings with 'group-by' projection (also known as 'AJAR' or 'FAQ' queries). This elementary measure allows to obtain comparable complexity bounds to the ones obtained by previous structural conditions tailored for efficient evaluation of semiring aggregate queries, enumeration algorithms of conjunctive queries, and tractability of counting answers to conjunctive queries.
  Project-connex tree decompositions are defined as the natural extension of the known notion of 'free-connex' decompositions. They allow for a unified, simple and intuitive algorithmic manipulation for evaluation of aggregate queries and explain some existing tractability results on conjunctive query enumeration, counting conjunctive query evaluation, and evaluation of semiring aggregate queries. Using this measure we also recover results relating tractable classes of counting conjunctive queries and bounded free-connex tree-width, or the constant-time delay enumeration of semiring aggregate queries over bounded project-connex classes. We further show that project-connex tree decompositions can be obtained via algorithms for computing classical tree decompositions.</description>

      <title>Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.</description>

      <title>Graph-Structured Data Analysis of Component Failure in Autonomous Cargo Ships Based on Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component failures in autonomous cargo ships (ACS) and the uncertainties in emergency decision-making, this paper proposes a novel hybrid feature fusion framework for constructing a graph-structured dataset of failure modes. By employing an improved cuckoo search algorithm (HN-CSA), the literature retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced, achieving improvements of 7.1% and 3.4% compared to the NSGA-II and CSA search algorithms, respectively. A hierarchical feature fusion framework is constructed, using Word2Vec encoding to encode subsystem/component features, BERT-KPCA to process failure modes/reasons, and Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes, and 6,150 propagation paths. Validation results show that the GATE-GNN model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks. Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are highly distinguishable. In the label prediction results, the Shore-based Meteorological Service System achieved an F1 score of 0.93, demonstrating high prediction accuracy. This paper not only provides a solid foundation for failure analysis in autonomous cargo ships but also offers reliable support for fault diagnosis, risk assessment, and intelligent decision-making systems.

      <title>Chain Table: Protecting Table-Level Data Integrity by Digital Ledger Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of blockchain and Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) has gained wide traction. Instead of relying on a traditional centralized data authority, a blockchain system consists of digitally entangled block data shared across a distributed network. The specially designed chain data structure and its consensus mechanism protect blockchain data from being tampered by unauthorized adversaries. However, implementing a full-fledged blockchain system to protect a database can be technically cumbersome. In this work, we introduce an in-database design, named chain table, to protect data integrity without the need for a blockchain system. It features a succinct design without significant technology barriers or storage overhead. To realize rigorous data security, we also propose a set of data writing principles for the chain table. We prove that the chain table, together with the data writing principles, will guarantee flexible data integrity, named table-level data integrity (TDI).</description>
