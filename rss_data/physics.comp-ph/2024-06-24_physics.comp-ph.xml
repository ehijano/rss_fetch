      <title>Manufactured Solutions for an Electromagnetic Slot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of electromagnetic penetration is an important topic in computational electromagnetics. Electromagnetic penetration occurs through intentional or inadvertent openings in an enclosed electromagnetic scatterer, which prevent the contents from being fully shielded from external fields. To efficiently model electromagnetic penetration, aperture or slot models can be used with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. A necessary step towards establishing the credibility of these models is to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods through code verification. Surface integral equations and slot models yield multiple interacting sources of numerical error and other challenges, which render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we provide approaches to separately measure the numerical errors arising from these different error sources for the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with a slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for a variety of cases.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning-assisted reconfigurable metasurface antenna for real-time holographic beam steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a metasurface antenna capable of real time holographic beam steering. An array of reconfigurable dipoeles can generate on demand far field patterns of radiation through the specific encoding of meta atomic states. i.e., the configuration of each dipole. Suitable states for the generation of the desired patterns can be identified using iteartion, but this is very slow and needs to be done for each far field pattern. Here, we present a deep learning based method for the control of a metasurface antenna with point dipole elements that vary in their state using dipole polarizability. Instead of iteration, we adopt a deep learning algorithm that combines an autoencoder with an electromagnetic scattering equation to determin the states required for a target far field pattern in real time. The scattering equation from Born approximation is used as the decoder in training the neural network, and analytic Green's function calculation is used to check the validity of Born approximation. Our learning based algorithm requires a computing time of within in 200 microseconds to determine the meta atomic states, thus enabling the real time opeartion of a holographic antenna.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Human Expertise in Weighted Ensemble Simulations through Deep Learning based Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted ensemble (WE) method stands out as a widely used segment-based sampling technique renowned for its rigorous treatment of kinetics. The WE framework typically involves initially mapping the configuration space onto a low-dimensional collective variable (CV) space and then partitioning it into bins. The efficacy of WE simulations heavily depends on the selection of CVs and binning schemes. The recently proposed State Predictive Information Bottleneck (SPIB) method has emerged as a promising tool for automatically constructing CVs from data and guiding enhanced sampling through an iterative manner. In this work, we advance this data-driven pipeline by incorporating prior expert knowledge. Our hybrid approach combines SPIB-learned CVs to enhance sampling in explored regions with expert-based CVs to guide exploration in regions of interest, synergizing the strengths of both methods. Through benchmarking on alanine dipeptide and chignoin systems, we demonstrate that our hybrid approach effectively guides WE simulations to sample states of interest, and reduces run-to-run variances. Moreover, our integration of the SPIB model also enhances the analysis and interpretation of WE simulation data by effectively identifying metastable states and pathways, and offering direct visualization of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Features of heterogeneously charged systems at their liquid-liquid critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently synthesized colloids and biological systems such as proteins, viruses and monoclonal antibodies are heterogeneously charged, i.e., different regions of their surfaces carry different amount of positive or negative charge. Because of charge anisotropy, the electrostatics interactions between these units through the surrounding medium are intristically anisotropic, meaning that they are characterized not only by the attraction between oppositely-charged regions but also by the repulsion between like-charged areas. Recent experiments have shown that the liquid-liquid phase separation of these systems can be driven by anisotropic electrostatics interactions, but it is not clear how the emerging aggregates are affected by charge imbalance and charge patchiness. The ability to experimentally control these two quantities calls for a theoretical understanding of their interplay, which we address here at the critical point. We consider a coarse grained model of anisotropically charged hard spheres whose interaction potential is grounded in a robust mean field theory and perform extensive numerical Monte Carlo simulations to understand the aggregation behavior of these units at the critical point. Stemming from the simplicity of the model, we address the interplay between charge imbalance and charge patchiness with the use of three parameters only and fully rationalize how these features impact the critical point of the model by means of thermodynamic-independent pair properties.</description>

      <title>Predicting atmospheric turbulence for secure quantum communications in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence is the main barrier to large-scale free-space quantum communication networks. Aberrations distort optical information carriers, thus limiting or preventing the possibility of establishing a secure link between two parties. For this reason, forecasting the turbulence strength within an optical channel is highly desirable, as it allows for knowing the optimal timing to establish a secure link in advance. Here, we train a Recurrent Neural Network, TAROCCO, to predict the turbulence strength within a free-space channel. The training is based on weather and turbulence data collected over 9 months for a 5.4 km intra-city free-space link across the City of Ottawa. The implications of accurate predictions from our network are demonstrated in a simulated high-dimensional Quantum Key Distribution protocol based on orbital angular momentum states of light across different turbulence regimes. TAROCCO will be crucial in validating a free-space channel to optimally route the key exchange for secure communications in real experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Extending GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Integrals in the TeraChem Software Package to f Type Orbitals: Implementation and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of GPUs for scientific computing has prompted interest in accelerating quantum chemical calculations through their use. The complexity of integral kernels for high angular momentum basis functions however often limits the utility of GPU implementations with large basis sets or for metal containing systems. In this work, we report implementation of $f$ function support in the GPU-accelerated TeraChem software package through the development of efficient kernels for the evaluation of Hamiltonian integrals. The resulting code is very efficient, and we demonstrate this with density functional theory calculations on increasingly large alkanes as well as coupled cluster singles and doubles calculations on water clusters. Preliminary investigations into Ni(I) catalysis and the photochemistry of MnH(CH$_3$) are also carried out. Overall, our GPU-accelerated software appears to be well-suited for fast simulation of large transition metal containing systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the origin of interface stress enhancement and compressive-to-tensile stress transition in immiscible nanomultilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic stress in nanomultilayers (NMLs) is typically dominated by interface stress, which is particularly high in immiscible Cu/W NMLs. Here, atomistic simulations with a chemically-accurate neural network potential reveal the role of interfacial intermixing and metastable phase formation on the interface stress levels. These results rationalize an experimentally-reported compressive- to-tensile transition as a function of NML deposition conditions and the extremely high interface stresses under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards a second generation of metascintillators using the Purcell effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on advancing metascintillators to break the 100 ps barrier and approach the 10 ps target. We exploit nanophotonic features, specifically the Purcell effect, to shape and enhance the scintillation properties of the first-generation metascintillator. We demonstrate that a faster emission is achievable along with a more efficient conversion efficiency. This results in a coincidence time resolution improved by a factor of 1.6, crucial for TOF-PET applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting electronic screening for fast Koopmans spectral functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopmans spectral functionals represent a powerful extension of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT), enabling accurate predictions of spectral properties with state-of-the-art accuracy. The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic modeling of the LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system with Bayesian model selection and uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chloride molten salts are increasingly recognized for their applications in pyroprocessing techniques for the separation of lanthanides. Understanding the thermodynamic properties of these molten salts is essential to optimize the separation process. Several thermodynamic models, including the associate model, the two-sublattice ionic model, and the modified quasichemical model with quadruplet approximation (MQMQA), are utilized to capture the complexity of molten salts. In the present work, the Bayes factor was used to guide model selection process for the thermodynamic modeling of the KCl-LaCl$_3$ system and provide statistical comparisons of liquid models. The results indicate that the MQMQA model is the most favorable model based on the available thermochemical data. The LiCl-KCl-LaCl$_3$ system was further optimized with uncertainty quantification using MQMQA. The thermodynamic properties of compounds in the KCl-LaCl$_3$ system were obtained from DFT-based phonon calculations. The calculated phase stability shows excellent agreement with experimental data, indicating that an appropriate model is important for accurately predicting the behavior of complex molten salts.</description>

Abstract: We present HTMPC, a Heavily Templated C++ library for large-scale simulations implementing multi-particle collision dynamics (MPC), a particle-based mesoscale hydrodynamic simulation method. The implementation is plugin-based, and designed for distributed computing over an arbitrary number of MPI ranks. By abstracting the hardware-dependent parts of the implementation, we provide an identical application-code base for various architectures, currently supporting CPUs and CUDA-capable GPUs. We have examined the code for a system of more than a trillion MPC particles distributed over a few thousand MPI ranks (GPUs), demonstrating the scalability of the implementation and its applicability to large-scale hydrodynamic simulations. As showcases, we examine passive and active suspension of colloids, which confirms the extensibility and versatility of our plugin-based implementation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Novel Silicon Allotropes with Optimized Band Gaps to Enhance Solar Cell Efficiency through Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15316v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of novel materials in recent years has been accelerated greatly by the use of computational modelling techniques aimed at elucidating the complex physics controlling microstructure formation in materials, the properties of which control material function. One such technique is the phase field method, a field theoretic approach that couples various thermophysical fields to microscopic order parameter fields that track the phases of microstructure. Phase field models are framed as multiple, non-linear, partial differential equations, which are extremely challenging to compute efficiently. Recent years have seen an explosion of computational algorithms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of phase field simulations. One such technique, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), dynamically adapts numerical meshes to be highly refined around steep spatial gradients of the PDE fields and coarser where the fields are smooth. This reduces the number of computations per time step significantly, thus reducing the total time of computation. What AMR doesn't do is allow for adaptive time stepping. This work combines AMR with a neural network algorithm that uses a U-Net with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (CLSTM) base to accelerate phase field simulations. Our neural network algorithm is described in detail and tested in on simulations of directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy, a paradigm that is highly practical for its relevance to the solidification of alloys.</description>

Abstract: Over the past few decades, a vast amount of information on the structure of atomic nuclei has been collected, compiled, and evaluated. Accurate and reliable data are essential for the understanding of the behavior of atomic nuclei. Accessing and utilizing these data, spread among different databases, has remained challenging for many researchers due to the complexity and diversity of data formats. This article presents the Toolkit for Nuclei (TkN) C++ open-source library that provides easy access to nuclear structure data. This library is intended to be used in theoretical models, data analysis software or simulation codes. It utilizes a comprehensive database built from different official sources and frequently updated. The user interface allows to easily access and search for nuclear structure data and TkN can be compiled without any dependencies, facilitating its incorporation into various research projects.</description>

Abstract: We study the influence of analytical regularization used in the generalized function (distribution) space to the Tikhonov regularization procedure utilized in the different versions of Moore-Penrose's inversion. By introducing a new analytical term to the Tikhonov regularization of Moore-Penrose's inversion procedure, we derive new optimization conditions that extend the Tikhonov regularization framework and influence the fitting parameter. This enhancement yields a more robust and accurate reconstruction of physical quantities, demonstrating its potential impact on various studies. We illustrate the significance of new term through schematic examples of physical applications, highlighting its relevance to diverse fields. Our findings provide a valuable tool for improving inversion methods and their applications in physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative dynamics of flat-band systems with correlated disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a numerical method for the time evolution of Gaussian wave packets on flat-band lattices in the presence of correlated disorder. To achieve this, we introduce a method to generate random on-site energies with prescribed correlations. We verify this method with a one-dimensional (1D) cross-stitch model, and find good agreement with analytical results obtained from the disorder-dressed evolution equations. This allows us to reproduce previous findings, that disorder can mobilize 1D flat-band states which would otherwise remain localized. As explained by the corresponding disorder-dressed evolution equations, such mobilization requires an asymmetric disorder-induced coupling to dispersive bands, a condition that is generically not fulfilled when the flat-band is resonant with the dispersive bands at a Dirac point-like crossing. We exemplify this with the 1D Lieb lattice. While analytical expressions are not available for the two-dimensional (2D) system due to its complexity, we extend the numerical method to the 2D $\alpha-T_3$ model, and find that the initial flat-band wave packet preserves its localization when $\alpha = 0$, regardless of disorder and intersections. However, when $\alpha\neq 0$, the wave packet shifts in real space. We interpret this as a Berry phase controlled, disorder-induced wave-packet mobilization. In addition, we present density functional theory calculations of candidate materials, specifically $\rm Hg_{1-x}Cd_xTe$. The flat-band emerges near the $\Gamma$ point ($\bf{k}=$0) in the Brillouin zone.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoregressive Neural Networks for Classical Spin Systems</title>

Abstract: Efficient sampling and approximation of Boltzmann distributions involving large sets of binary variables, or spins, are pivotal in diverse scientific fields even beyond physics. Recent advances in generative neural networks have significantly impacted this domain. However, these neural networks are often treated as black boxes, with architectures primarily influenced by data-driven problems in computational science. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel autoregressive neural network architecture named TwoBo, specifically designed for sparse two-body interacting spin systems. We directly incorporate the Boltzmann distribution into its architecture and parameters, resulting in enhanced convergence speed, superior free energy accuracy, and reduced trainable parameters. We perform numerical experiments on disordered, frustrated systems with more than 1000 spins on grids and random graphs, and demonstrate its advantages compared to previous autoregressive and recurrent architectures. Our findings validate a physically informed approach and suggest potential extensions to multivalued variables and many-body interaction systems, paving the way for broader applications in scientific research.</description>

      <title>Anti-Coulomb ion-ion interactions: a theoretical and computational study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The free energy of ion solvation can be decomposed into enthalpic and entropic contributions. This helps to understand the connection between the dielectric properties and the underlying forces. We present a simple linear-response model of screened charge interactions that provides an alternative understanding of solvation barriers. Moreover, it explains the "anti-Coulomb" interactions (attraction between like-charged ions and repulsion between opposite-charged ions) observed in both simulations and experiments. We show that this is a universal behavior associated to the non-local response function of any dielectric or metallic system.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of hole mobility for 4H-silicon carbide through suppressing interband electron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) possesses a high Baliga figure of merit, making it a promising material for power electronics. However, its applications are limited by its low hole mobility. Herein, we found that the hole mobility of 4H-SiC is mainly limited by the strong interband electron-phonon scattering using mode-level first-principles calculations. Our research indicates that applying compressive strain can reverse the sign of crystal-field splitting and change the ordering of electron bands close to the valence band maximum. Therefore, the interband electron-phonon scattering is severely suppressed, and the out-of-plane hole mobility of 4H-SiC can be enhanced by 200% with 2% uniaxial compressive strain applied. This work provides new insights into the electron transport mechanisms in semiconductors and suggests a strategy to improve hole mobility that could be applied to other semiconductors with hexagonal crystalline geometries.</description>
