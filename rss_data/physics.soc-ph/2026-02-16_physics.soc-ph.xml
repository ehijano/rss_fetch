      <title>Forecasting emergency department visits in the reference hospital of the Balearic Islands: the role of tourist and weather data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of patient arrivals at emergency departments (EDs) is vital for efficient resource allocation and high-quality patient care. In this study we investigate the relevance of exogenous variables, namely tourism, weather, calendar and demographic variables, in forecasting ED visits in the reference hospital in Palma de Mallorca, a city with significant seasonal population fluctuations due to tourism. Using a machine learning approach, we develop a model that predicts ED visits based solely on these exogenous variables. We test different machine learning algorithms (random forests, support vector machines, and feedforward neural networks) with different combinations of input variables and compare their symmetric mean average percentage errors (SMAPEs). Our findings reveal that calendar information, resident, and tourist population data are statistically significant for the accuracy of the predictions, while the addition of weather data does not provide any further improvement. Comparison of non-time-series with time-series prediction models reveals that the latter provide better accuracy for short prediction horizons (e.g. shorter than a week). Furthermore, time-series models become less or equally accurate to models relying only on exogenous variables for long prediction horizons (e.g. fortnight or month). Our study highlights the importance of carefully selecting predictive variables to ensure short- and long-term, robust and reliable forecasts. This demonstrates that, despite their lower complexity, non-time-series models with well-chosen input variables can be as effective as time-series models when predicting for long time horizons.</description>

      <title>Modelling human activities in a system of cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities host most of the world population with diverse services and activities. One key challenge in urban modelling is the quantification of intra- and inter-city mobility patterns and the associated space-time dynamics of population density and anthropogenic activities. To address this, we apply the novel agent-based urban model DAVE (Dynamic Anthropogenic actiVities and feedback to Emissions) to simulate population behaviour and mobility in the Vaud and Geneva Cantons, a system of small- to medium-size cities in Switzerland. Simulation results provide detailed temporal (10 min) and spatial (500 m) population dynamics for different age groups and day types. DAVE further models the time-varying population distribution in 11 different microenvironments (e.g., home, work, leisure, outdoor) and the travel flows by different modes. Simulation results align with observations, confirming the possibility of driving urban system modelling with statistical information on residents' behaviour. Sustainability and health indicators like daily driving distance and walking time for each neighbourhood are also reflected by the model with urban-rural gradients displayed. This work serves as a foundation for future applications of DAVE to study bottom-up human-built environment interactions, from anthropogenic emissions and building energy to urban climate, exposure, and health in cities around the world.</description>

      <title>Far-reaching consequences of trait preferences for animal social network structure and function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network structures play an important role in the lives of animals by affecting individual fitness and the spread of disease and information. Nevertheless, we still lack a good understanding of how these structures emerge from the behavior of individuals. Generative network models provide a powerful approach that can help close this gap. Empirical research has shown that trait-based social preferences (preferences for social partners with certain trait values, such as sex, body size, relatedness etc.) play a key role in the formation of social networks across species. Currently, however, we lack a good understanding of how such preferences affect network properties. In this study: 1) we develop a general and flexible generative network model that can create artificial (simulated) networks where social connection is affected by trait-based social preferences; 2) we use this model to investigate how different trait-based social preferences affect social network structure and function. We find that the preferences can affect the efficiency of the networks in terms of transmitting disease and information, and their robustness against fragmentation when individuals disappear, with the effects often - but not always - going in the direction of slower transmission and lower robustness. Furthermore, the extent and form of the effects depend on both the type of preference and the type of trait it is used with. The findings lead to new insights about the potential mechanisms driving the structural diversity of animal social networks, the importance of trait value distributions for social structure, the degree distributions of social networks, and the detectability of trait effects from network data. Overall, the study shows that trait-based social preferences can have far-reaching consequences for populations.</description>

      <title>Transforming Policy-Car Swerving for Mitigating Stop-and-Go Traffic Waves: A Practice-Oriented Jam-Absorption Driving Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves, as a major form of freeway traffic congestion, cause severe and long-lasting adverse effects, including reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. Amongst the highway traffic management strategies, jam-absorption driving (JAD), in which a dedicated vehicle performs "slow-in" and "fast-out" maneuvers before being captured by a stop-and-go wave, has been proposed as a potential method for preventing the propagation of such waves. However, most existing JAD strategies remain impractical mainly due to the lack of discussion regarding implementation vehicles and operational conditions. Inspired by real-world observations of police-car swerving behavior, this paper first introduces a Single-Vehicle Two-Detector Jam-Absorption Driving (SVDD-JAD) problem, and then proposes a practical JAD strategy that transforms such behavior into a maneuver capable of suppressing the propagation of an isolated stop-and-go wave. Five key parameters that significantly affect the proposed strategy, namely, JAD speed, inflow traffic speed, wave width, wave speed, and in-wave speed, are identified and systematically analyzed. Using a SUMO-based simulation as an illustrative example, we further demonstrate how these parameters can be measured in practice with two stationary roadside traffic detectors. The results show that the proposed JAD strategy successfully suppresses the propagation of a stop-and-go wave, without triggering a secondary wave. This paper is expected to take a significant step toward making JAD practical, advancing it from a theoretical concept to a feasible and implementable strategy. To promote reproducibility in the transportation domain, we have also open-sourced all the code on our GitHub repository https://github.com/gotrafficgo.</description>
