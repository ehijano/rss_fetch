      <title>Moir\'e $M$-valley bilayers: quasi-one-dimensional physics, unconventional spin textures and twisted van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of quasi-two-dimensional kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$, we consider the theory of twisted bilayers in which the Fermi surface is near the $M$-point. Surprisingly, unlike twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides, the moir\'e potential is quasi-one-dimensional: at each $M$-valley, the potential flattens the dispersion strongly along one direction, and weakly along the perpendicular direction. The combination of spin-orbit coupling and twist-induced broken inversion symmetry results in a similarly anisotropic `$\textit{moir\'e-Rashba}$' potential, which spin-splits the dispersion into coexisting two-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional bands. We discuss novel aspects of the interplay between mixed dimensionality and spin textures in this platform. First, an applied electric field produces spin polarisation which can be tuned by doping, suggesting potential spintronics applications. Secondly, an in-plane magnetic field momentum- and spin-polarises the Fermi surfaces, producing unconventional spin density waves. Thirdly, in the small-twist-angle limit, the large density of states due to a twisted van Hove singularity near $M$ results in a dense energy spectrum. Our results demonstrate a new variation of moir\'e bandstructure engineering, instigating the study of spin-textured one-dimensional physics in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Sheds Light on Integer and Fractional Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic topological phases of matter, characterized by robust boundary states derived from topologically nontrivial bulk states, are pivotal for next-generation electronic devices. However, understanding their complex quantum phases, especially at larger scales and fractional fillings with strong electron correlations, has long posed a formidable computational challenge. Here, we employ a deep learning framework to express the many-body wavefunction of topological states in twisted ${\rm MoTe_2}$ systems, where diverse topological states are observed. Leveraging neural networks, we demonstrate the ability to identify and characterize topological phases, including the integer and fractional Chern insulators as well as the $Z_2$ topological insulators. Our deep learning approach significantly outperforms traditional methods, not only in computational efficiency but also in accuracy, enabling us to study larger systems and differentiate between competing phases such as fractional Chern insulators and charge density waves. Our predictions align closely with experimental observations, highlighting the potential of deep learning techniques to explore the rich landscape of topological and strongly correlated phenomena.</description>

      <title>Twist-angle evolution of the intervalley-coherent antiferromagnet in twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental reports of correlated physics in twisted homobilayer WSe$_2$ have spurred interest in the interplay of electronic interactions and topology in this system. Here, we explore its phase diagram using the Hartree-Fock approximation within a three-orbital Wannier model of the bilayer. Our analysis reveals a dominant intervalley-coherent antiferromagnetic instability, whose stability in the space of twist angle, interaction strength, out-of-plane displacement field, and hole density is primarily set by nesting and commensurability. At large angles or low interaction-to-bandwidth ratios, the instability arises at hole densities above half filling near a van-Hove line where the strong Fermi surface nesting occurs due to the flatness of the band in a region enclosing the van-Hove and $\kappa$ points. Increasing interaction strength or decreasing the twist angle gradually shifts the ordered phase toward half filling, where the strongest antiferromagnetic order gets pinned due to commensurability effects that enable a full gap opening. The antiferromagnetic order parameter strongly couples to the layer polarization, which makes its transition to the normal state sharp in the strong-coupling limit and carries implications for collective modes. Our Hartree-Fock phase diagram reproduces key aspects of recent experiments and the reconstructed Fermi surfaces and DOS in the antiferromagnetic phase account for subtle transport signatures observed in these studies.</description>

      <title>Effective Conformal Field Theory generated from Pure and Dephased Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the fidelity between two states with different Chern numbers $\mathcal Z = \mathrm{tr} \{ \rho \rho' \} $ serves as a generating theory for an effective conformal field theory (CFT) at the $(2+0)d$ temporal interface. $\rho$ can be chosen as a pure trivial insulator, and $\rho'$ can be taken as a pure or dephased Chern insulator density matrix. More specifically, we obtain the following results: (1) through evaluation of the effective central charge, stiffness, and correlation function (the ``strange correlators"), we demonstrate that the fidelity between a trivial insulator and an insulator with Chern number $C=1$ maps to a CFT with effective central charge $c_{\rm eff} = 1$; while the fidelity between two Chern insulators with Chern numbers $C = \pm 1$ maps to a CFT with $c_{\rm eff} = 2$. (2) The density matrix of the Chern insulator becomes a quantum spin Hall insulator in the doubled Hilbert space, and the dephasing acts as interaction between the two spin species. (3) In the limit of infinite dephasing the Chern insulator becomes a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert space, featuring the ``strong-weak" U(1) spontaneous symmetry breaking. The analysis based on Laughlin wave function and previous studies of projected wave function of quantum spin Hall insulator suggest this is a power-law superconductor. (4) With increasing strength of dephasing, the amplitude of single particle strange correlator is suppressed, while the Cooper pair strange correlator is enhanced, consistent with the trend of emerging superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Dirac node pinning from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a Kagome spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments on the Kagome spin liquid candidate YCOB suggest the presence of Dirac fermionic spinons near the magnetization plateau at 1/9. Theories suggest that the spinons are charge neutral spin-$1/2$ excitations, in a $2\pi/3$ flux which triples the unit cell. Generally a gap is expected, and there is no symmetry protection for the Dirac nodes in this system. The question arises as to what causes the nodes and stabilizes them. In this work, we propose a node-creation and node-pinning mechanism driven by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. Employing Gutzwiller-projected variational Monte Carlo calculations, we demonstrate that DM interactions induce a band closing phase transition in the spinon spectrum. There is a change in the Chern number when the bands are inverted. Together with the DM-generated internal gauge flux, the coupling to the spinon orbital magnetization counteracts the band reopening. This interplay energetically pins the Dirac nodes over a range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical point followed by Kondo-like behavior due to Cu substitution in itinerant, antiferromagnet ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ is an itinerant magnet with a small saturated moment of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu_{B}/\text{Ni}$ and a series of antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_1$ = 61.0 K, $T_2$ = 56.5 K and $T_3$ = 42.2 K. Temperature and field dependent measurements suggest a complex, anisotropic $H-T$ phase diagram with multiple phase lines. Here we present the growth and characterization of single crystals of the ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ series for 0 $\leq x \leq$ 0.181. Using a suite of anisotropic magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic measurements we study the evolution of the three AFM transitions upon Cu substitution. For ${0 \leq x \leq 0.097}$, the system remains magnetically ordered at base temperature with $x \leq$ 0.012, showing signs of three primarily AFM phases. For the higher substitution levels, ${0.125 \leq x \leq 0.181}$, there are no signatures of magnetic ordering, but an anomalous feature in resistance and heat capacity data are observed which are consistent with the Kondo effect in this system. The intermediate $x$ = 0.105 sample lies in between the magnetic ordered and the Kondo regime and is in the vicinity of the AFM-quantum critical point (QCP). Thus, ${\text{La}_{2}\text{(Cu}_{x}\text {Ni}_{1-x})_7}$ is an example of a small moment system that can be tuned through a QCP. Given these data combined with the fact that the $\text{La}_2 \text{Ni}_7$ structure has kagome-like, Ni-sublattice running perpendicular to the crystallographic $c-$ axis, and a $3d$-electron flat band that contributes to the density of states near the Fermi energy, it becomes a promising candidate to host and study exotic physics.</description>

      <title>Revealing electronic correlations in YNi$_2$B$_2$C using photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined density functional theory (DFT), one-step model of photoemission, and soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES) study of the electronic structure of the quaternary borocarbide superconductor YNi$_2$B$_2$C. Our analysis reveals the presence of moderate electronic correlations beyond the semilocal DFT within the generalized gradient approximation. We show that DFT and the full potential Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) with average Coulomb interaction U = 3.0 eV and the exchange energy J = 0.9 eV applied to the Ni d-states are necessary for reproducing the experimentally observed SX-ARPES spectra.</description>

      <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T-TaS2-xSex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, we report the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T-TaS2, through isoelectronic substitute of S. We investigate systematically the evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T-TaS2-xSex (0=&lt;x=&lt;2) using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, we attribute the pseudogap phase to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent physics.</description>

      <title>Effective enhancement of the electron-phonon coupling driven by nonperturbative electronic density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical mean-field study of the nonperturbative electronic mechanisms, which may lead to significant enhancements of the electron-phonon coupling in correlated electron systems. Analyzing the effects of electronic correlations on the lowest-order electron-phonon processes, we show that in the proximity of the Mott metal-to-insulator transition of the doped square lattice Hubbard model, where the isothermal charge response becomes particularly large at small momenta, the coupling of electrons to the lattice is strongly increased. This, in turn, induces significant corrections to both the electronic self-energy and phonon-mediated pairing interaction, indicating the possible onset of a strong interplay between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom even for small values of the bare electron-phonon coupling.</description>

      <title>Singly occupied 4$f$ antiferromagnetic insulators: CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth containing wide band gap oxides, which provide spin-photon interface and narrow linewidth optical emission, are getting significant attention as the most promising candidate materials in advancing quantum transduction and memories. Here, from $ab~initio$ calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic ground states in structurally preferred monoclinic CePO$_4$ and tetragonal CeVO$_4$ exhibiting localized occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states with $4f-4f$ transition characteristics. Interestingly, in CePO$_4$, O $2p$ and P $3p$ states hybridize negligibly with Ce $4f$ states, while in CeVO$_4$, V $3d$ and O $2p$ states hybridize and appear as extended states in between the occupied and unoccupied Ce $4f$ states. Here, phonon calculations and analysis identify and differentiate Raman active phonon modes along with the spin phonon coupling of Ce in both CePO$_4$ and CeVO$_4$ that ultimately lead to different $4f$ ground state crystal field multiplets, which are critical to accurately describe electronic transitions for foundational quantum transduction and memories. Further, the identified $C_1$ site symmetry of Ce, lacking inversion symmetry in CePO$_4$, is relevant for quantum memories and $D_{2d}$ site symmetry of Ce exhibiting inversion symmetry in CeVO$_4$ is relevant for quantum transduction.</description>

      <title>Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasi-particle creation and multiband geometry in fractional Chern insulators under magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Diverse Magnetic Phase Diagram and Anomalous Hall Effect in Antiferromagetic LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between conduction electrons and magnetism can significantly enhance the Hall signal, a phenomenon known as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE). While the AHE is generally not expected in antiferromagnets with vanishing magnetization, a large AHE is observed in certain antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin textures and nonvanishing Berry curvature. In this work, we present a rich temperature and magnetic phase diagram with eight distinct magnetic phases for the antiferromagnetic kagome compound LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$. In the coplanar canted antiferromagnetic phase, we observe an AHE, which likely originates from the intrinsic effects. Upon entering the ferromagnetic phase, the AHE significantly increases and exceeds the conventional limits of AHE of intrinsic origin. Additionally, we observe a topological Hall effect (THE) that emerges in the conical magnetic phase. Notably, the THE in LuMn$_6$Sn$_6$ persists over an extended magnetic field range of up to 25~T. Our detailed transport measurements highlight the need for theoretical modeling to explain the observations of AHE and THE in $R$Mn$_6$Sn$_6$ ($R$= Rare earth) family of compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frustrated honeycomb spin model can stabilize a subextensively degenerate spiral spin liquid with nontrivial topological excitations and defects, but its material realization remains rare. Here, we report the experimental realization of this model in the structurally disorder-free compound GdZnPO. Using a single-crystal sample, we find that spin-7/2 rare-earth Gd$^{3+}$ ions form a honeycomb lattice with dominant second-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic and first-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic couplings, along with easy-plane single-site anisotropy. This frustrated model stabilizes a unique spiral spin liquid with a degenerate contour around the $\mathrm{K}$$\{$1/3,1/3$\}$ point in reciprocal space, consistent with our experiments down to 30 mK, including the observation of a giant residual specific heat. Our results establish GdZnPO as an ideal platform for exploring the stability of spiral spin liquids and their novel properties, such as the emergence of low-energy topological defects on the sublattices.</description>

      <title>Low-energy perspective of interacting electrons in the normal state of superconducting bilayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a strongly enhanced entanglement within the pseudogap regime of the Hubbard model. This entanglement is estimated from the quantum Fisher information and, avoiding the ill-conditioned analytical continuation, the quantum variance. Both are lower bounds for the actual entanglement that can be calculated from the (antiferromagnetic) susceptibility, obtained here with the dynamical vertex approximation. Our results qualitatively agree with experimental neutron scattering experiments for various cuprates. Theory predicts a $\ln(1/T)$ divergence of the entanglement for low temperatures $T$, which is however cut-off by the onset of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Nonpertubative Many-Body Theory for the Two-Dimensional Hubbard Model at Low Temperature: From Weak to Strong Coupling Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the theoretical study of two-dimensional systems, difficulties emerge as that quantum phase transitions at zero temperature cause low- and high-temperature scenarios to belong to different branches, while the Mermin-Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking at finite temperatures, excluding a Landau phase transition marked by a critical temperature $T_c$. In many-body theory, fundamental symmetries like Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI), Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem (FDT), and Pauli-repulsive principle must be satisfied, yet widely-used approximate theories struggle to meet them simultaneously. We introduce a symmetrization theory that, by using spurious broken phases from approximate theories, can naturally generate different low- and high-temperature branches. Employing the GW method beyond mean-field and the covariance scheme, which strictly satisfy WTI and FDT, we numerically show that the violation of Pauli-repulsive principle is significantly less than that in mean-field, and further restore Pauli-repulsive principle without breaking WTI and FDT. By calculating symmetrized one-body Green's function and two-body correlation function and comparing them with accurate results from Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we demonstrate its numerical accuracy at low temperatures and strong coupling. This symmetrization theory can be easily applied to other two-dimensional systems at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization and conceptual barriers in variational finite Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected entangled pair states (PEPS) on finite two-dimensional lattices are a natural ansatz for representing ground states of local many-body Hamiltonians, as they inherently satisfy the boundary law of entanglement entropy. In this paper, we propose the optimization of PEPS via an improved formulation of the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), namely the minimum-step stochastic-reconfguration scheme recently introduced for neural quantum states. We further discuss possible numerical issues that might arise in such a sampling-based approach. In this context, investigate the entanglement properties of random PEPS and find an entanglement phase transition. We note that on one side of this transition, we can identify positive random tensors as product states. To demonstrate the power of the framework described in this paper, we apply the PEPS to study the notoriously challenging chiral spin liquids. Moreover, we exhibit our approach's capability to naturally handle long-range interactions by exploring the phase diagram of Rydberg atom arrays with long-range interactions. We further provide parallelized easy-to-use code, allowing the straightforward application of our method to general Hamiltonians composed of local interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Emergent quasi-particles of spin-1 trimer chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J &gt;0$ and $J' &gt;0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer new perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Gapless Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of gapless phases with categorical (or so-called non-invertible) symmetries is a formidable task, in particular in higher than two space-time dimensions. In this paper we build on previous works arXiv:2408.05266 and arXiv:2502.20440 on gapped phases in (2+1)d and provide a systematic framework to study phase transitions with categorical symmetries. The Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) is, as often in these matters, the central tool. Applied to gapless theories, we need to consider the extension of the SymTFT to interfaces between topological orders, so-called ``club sandwiches", which realize generalizations of so-called Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) transformations. This requires an input phase transition for a smaller symmetry, such as the Ising transition for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, and the SymTFT constructs a transformation to a gapless phase with a larger categorical symmetry. We carry this out for categorical symmetries whose SymTFT is a (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theory for a finite group $G$ with twist -- so-called all bosonic fusion 2-categories. We classify such interfaces using a physically motivated picture of generalized gauging, as well as with a complementary analysis using (bi-)module 2-categories.This is exemplified in numerous abelian and non-abelian DW theories, giving rise to interesting gapless phases such as intrinsically gapless symmetry protected phases (igSPTs) and spontaneous symmetry breaking phases (igSSBs) from abelian, $S_3$, and $D_8$ DW theories.</description>

      <title>A Jellium Model for the Anomalous Hall Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jellium model is a paradigmatic problem in condensed matter physics, exhibiting a phase transition between metallic and Wigner crystal phases. However, its vanishing Berry curvature makes it ill-suited for studying recent experimental platforms that combine strong interactions with nontrivial quantum geometry. These experiments inspired the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) -- a topological variant of the Wigner crystal. The AHC spontaneously breaks continuous translation symmetry but has a nonzero Chern number. In this work, we introduce $\lambda-$jellium, a minimal extension of the two-dimensional jellium model. Its Berry curvature distribution is controlled by a single parameter, $\lambda$, where $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the standard jellium model. This setup facilitates the systematic exploration of Berry curvature's impact on electron crystallization. The phase diagram of this model, established using self-consistent Hartree Fock calculations, reveals several interesting features: (i) The AHC phase occupies a large region of the phase diagram. (ii) Two distinct Wigner crystal phases, the latter enabled by quantum geometry, and two distinct Fermi liquid phases are present. (iii) A continuous phase transition separates the AHC and one of the WC phases. (iv) In some parts of the AHC phase, the lattice geometry is non-triangular, unlike in the classical Wigner crystal. In addition to elucidating the physics of correlated electrons with nonzero Berry curvature, we expect that the simplicity of the model makes it an excellent starting point for more advanced numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Ground state and magnetic transitions of the orthorhombic antiferromagnet CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the systematic synthesis, crystal structure, magnetization, and powder neutron diffraction of single crystalline and polycrystalline CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ samples. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ crystallizes in an orthorhombic structure with $Pnma$ space group, featuring chains of edge-shared CoO$_6$ octahedra arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Two antiferromagnetic transitions are observed at $T$$_{N1}$ = 14.4 K and $T$$_{N2}$ = 16.2 K, corresponding to two long-range magnetic orders with propagation vectors of $\bf{k}$$_1$ = (0, 0, 0) and $\bf{k}$$_2$ = (0.125, 0, 0.25), respectively. The ground state is determined as a canted up-up-down-down zigzag spin configuration along the $c$ axis, wherein the magnetic moments of Co1 and Co2 ions are 3.4(1) and 2.1(1)$\mu$$_B$, respectively. Successive spin-flop transitions appear with the increasing magnetic field applied along the easy axis ($c$ axis), accompanied by depression of the antiferromagnetic orders and enhancement of residual magnetic entropy. The field-induced spin-disordered state suggests that CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ may be an ideal candidate for studying frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <title>Abundance of spin liquids in the $S=1$ bilinear-biquadratic model on the pyrochlore lattice, and its application to $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long considered the ''poor cousins'' of spin-1/2 systems, magnets built of spin-1 moments have recently come to fore as a rich source of novel phases of matter. Here we explore the phases which arise in a spin-1 magnet on the pyrochlore lattice, once biquadratic interactions are taken into account. Using a combination of variational and Monte Carlo techniques, built around the exact treatment of spin-1 at the level of a single site, we uncover seven distinct spin liquid phases. Dynamical calculations for one of these spin liquids are shown to be in good agreement with inelastic neutron scattering on the spin-1 pyrochlore $\mathrm{NaCaNi}_2\mathrm{F}_7$. These results suggest that the range of spin liquid phases found in spin-1 pyrochlores may be even richer than in materials with (pseudo-)spin-1/2 moments.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of the magnetic ground state in the frustrated magnets Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically, the relative change of the Heisenberg-type nearest-neighbor coupling $J_1$ and next-nearest-neighbor coupling $J_2$ in the face-centered-cubic lattice can give rise to three main antiferromagnetic orderings of type-I, type-II, and type-III. However, it is difficult to tune the $J_2/J_1$ ratio in real materials. Here, we report studies on the influence of Te$^{6+}$ and W$^{6+}$ ions replacement to the magnetic interactions and the magnetic ground states in the double-perovskite compounds Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co). For Ba$_2$MnTe$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$, the W$^{6+}$ doping on Te$^{6+}$ site is successful in $0.02 \leq x \leq 0.9$ with short-range orders of the type-I ($0.02 \leq x \leq 0.08$) and type-II ($0.1 \leq x \leq 0.9$). In Ba$_2$CoTe$_{1-x}$W${_x}$O$_6$, x-ray diffraction measurements reveal two crystal structures, including the trigonal phase ($0 \leq x \leq 0.1$) and the cubic phase ($0.5 \leq x \leq 1$), between which is a miscibility gap. Two magnetic transitions are identified in the trigonal phase due to two magnetic subsystems, and the type-II magnetic order is observed in the cubic phase. Magnetic phase diagrams of Ba$_2M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_{x}$O$_6$ ($M$ = Mn, Co) are established. Our work shows that the magnetic interactions and ground states of Ba$_2$$M$Te$_{1-x}$W$_x$O$_6$ can be tuned effectively by the replacement of Te$^{6+}$ by W$^{6+}$ ions.</description>

      <title>RKKY interaction in the presence of a charge-density-wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of a charge-density-wave (CDW) order on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction has been theoretically investigated. Assuming that the CDW with an incommensurate ordering vector ${\bf Q}_c$ is induced by a Fermi surface nesting, we show that the CDW order suppresses the conventional RKKY interaction and that it can induce a mode coupling between magnetic ordering vectors ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$. This suggests that below the CDW transition temperature, the correlation between localized spins may develop at both ${\bf q}_m$ and ${\bf q}_m\pm {\bf Q}_c$. Experimental implications of our result to van der Waals materials $R$Te$_3$ are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustration-free Hamiltonians provide pivotal models for understanding quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we establish a general framework for frustration-free fermionic systems. First, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a free fermion model to be frustration-free. In the case of translation-invariant, noninteracting systems, we show that any band touching between the valence and conduction bands is at least quadratic. Furthermore, by extending the Gosset-Huang inequality to fermionic systems, we demonstrate that even in interacting and non-translation-invariant cases, the finite-size gap of gapless excitations scales as $O((\log L)^2/L^2)$, provided the ground-state correlation function exhibits a power-law decay. Our results provide a foundation for studying frustration-free fermionic systems, including flat-band ferromagnetism and $\eta$-pairing states.</description>

      <title>$3d$ flat bands and coupled $4f$ moments in the kagome-honeycomb permanent magnet Sm$_{2}$Co$_{17}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs) with both localized moments and itinerant conduction bands are not only important for fundamental research but also have significant technological applications. In particular, Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ is a prototypical high-temperture REPM, where the Co atoms form a kagome-honeycomb stacked lattice. Here we report synthesis of epitaxial Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ films using molecular beam epitaxy and measurements of their momentum-resolved electronic structure from \textit{in-situ} angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results unveil two flat bands from Co $3d$ orbitals near the Fermi level ($E_F$), one at $\sim$-300meV and another right at $E_F$, which arise from orbital-selective destructive interference and strong electron correlations, respectively. In addition, our results reveal that Sm $4f$ states are far away from $E_F$ (hence mostly localized) and exhibit an anomalous temperature dependence, caused by the $3d$-$4f$ magnetic coupling. Our findings provide direct spectroscopic insights to understand the strong uniaxial ferromagnetism in Sm$_{\rm 2}$Co$_{\rm 17}$ (and REPMs alike). Our work also opens avenues to explore flat-band physics near $E_F$ and emergent phenomena in correlated kagome-honeycomb lattices.</description>

      <title>Interplanar magnetic exchange in CoPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron three-axis spectrometry has been used to determine the interplanar magnetic exchange parameter in the magnetic van der Waals compound CoPS$_3$. The exchange is found to be small and antiferromagnetic, estimated to be 0.020 $\pm$ 0.001 meV, which is surprising considering that the magnetic structure is correlated ferromagnetically between the ab planes. A possible explanation, involving a small anisotropy in the exchanges, is proposed. The results are discussed with reference to the other members of the transition metal-PS3 compounds.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations and Structural Transition in Cluster Mott Insulator Candidate Nb3Cl8 Revealed by 93Nb- and 35Cl-NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the cluster Mott insulator candidate compound Nb3Cl8, this study performs 93Nb and 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements to investigate the electron correlations. Below the structural transition temperature Ts ~ 97 K, all satellites of the 93Nb NMR spectra split into three distinct peaks, which suggests symmetry lowering due to the structural transition and could be attributed to the change in the Nb-Nb bond-lengths of the Nb3 clusters. The spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 divided by the temperature T, 1/T1T, increases upon cooling to Ts for all Cl sites, whereas only the Knight shift K of Cl located at the center of the Nb3 clusters exhibits a temperature dependence similar to that observed in magnetic susceptibility. These findings collectively demonstrate the existence of strong spin correlations between the Nb atoms in Nb3Cl8, which are closely associated with Mottness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the synthesis of single crystals of a new kagome compound, UV$_6$Sn$_6$, and present the results of magnetization, electrical resistivity, heat capacity, X-ray and neutron diffraction experiments to characterize the structure and magnetic properties. UV$_6$Sn$_6$ crystallizes in a large supercell of the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$ parent structure with an hexagonal symmetry in which some of the U atoms are shifted by $c/2$ in an ordered fashion. Below $T_{N1}=30$ K, an incommensurate magnetic structure with a temperature-dependent wavevector $(0,0,k_z)$ is observed. Below $T_{N2}=23.5$ K, the wavevector locks in to $(0,0,0.5)$ forming an antiferromagnetic ground state. The U moments align along the \(c\) axis retaining a large magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological protection in Rydberg lattices via a novel quantum Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have recently been conjectured to host $Z_2$ quantum spin liquids (QSLs) in certain parameter regimes. Due to the strong interactions between these atoms, it is not possible to analytically study these systems, and one must resort to Monte Carlo sampling of the path integral to reach definite conclusions. We use a tailored update, specifically designed to target the low energy excitations of the QSL. This allows us to reliably simulate Rydberg atoms on a triangular lattice in the proposed QSL regime. We identify a correlated paramagnetic phase at low temperatures which hosts topological protection similar to a $Z_2$ spin liquid up to a length scale tuned by Hamiltonian parameters. However, this correlated paramagnet seems to be continuously connected to the trivial paramagnetic regime and thus does not seem to be a true QSL. This result indicates the feasibility of Rydberg atom arrays to act as topological qubits.</description>

      <title>From time crystals to time quasicrystals: Exploring novel phases in transverse field Ising chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals (TCs) and time quasicrystals (TQCs) represent novel phases of matter that arise from the breaking of time translational symmetry in periodically and quasiperiodically driven quantum systems. In this study, we explore the formation of a TQC phase within the disordered quantum Ising chain model under a transverse field (ITF). Notably, TQCs demonstrate robust subharmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies, unlike traditional TCs which respond at a single frequency. Our analysis reveals that the TQC phase exhibits stable magnetization responses even in the presence of interaction perturbations and imperfections in the quasiperiodic driving fields. Employing exact diagonalization techniques, we find that increasing the chain length further stabilizes both TC and TQC phases. These results suggest promising pathways for experimental realization of TQCs in cold atomic systems and quantum simulators, opening avenues for deeper investigation into these intriguing dynamical phenomena.</description>

      <title>General rules for obtaining Hopf term by coupling Dirac cones to spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the topological Hopf term in two-dimensional (2D) spin systems can be derived by coupling to massless Dirac fermions. In an earlier work, we realized the Hopf term in a four-band lattice model. The key difficulty is avoiding canclation of the topological term contributed from different cones. In the present work, we provide general rules for obtaining nonzero Hopf term in spin systems when coupling to Dirac fermions. This method allows to direct dectation of the coefficient of the Hopf term without detailed calculations from path integral. We apply this framework to several models and verify that our results are self-consistent. Especially, we design a simple two-cone model on the checkerboard lattice and demonstrate how it realizes the Hopf term according to the above rules.</description>

      <title>UV$_6$Sn$_6$: a new kagome material with unusual $5f$ magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials in the family $R$V$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ ($R=$ rare earth) provide a unique platform to investigate the interplay between local moments from $R$ layers and nonmagnetic vanadium kagome layers. Yet, the investigation of actinide members remains scarce. Here we report the synthesis of UV$_{6}$Sn$_{6}$ single crystals through the self-flux technique. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal expansion measurements reveal two uranium-driven antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1}=29$~K and $T_{N2}=24$~K, a complex field-temperature phase diagram, and unusual negative domain wall magnetoresistance. Specific heat measurements unveil a modest Sommerfeld coefficient of $\gamma = 40$~mJ/mol.K$^{2}$, consistent with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements that show a moderate $f$-electron enhancement at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$). Our experiments support a modest contribution from \textit{5f} flat bands to the density of states at $E_{F}$, whereas our band structure calculations place the vanadium flat bands 0.25~eV above $E_{F}$. Our findings point to a materials opportunity to expand the uranium 166 family with the goal of enhancing correlations by tuning $5f$ and $3d$ flat bands to $E_{F}$.</description>

      <title>Boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality for the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa (GNY) models. Employing interacting Dirac fermions on a honeycomb lattice with armchair boundaries, we use mean-field theory to uncover rich boundary criticalities at the quantum phase transition to a charge-density-wave (CDW) insulator, including the ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. The Dirac fermions satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition, while the boson field, representing the CDW order, obeys Dirichlet and Neumann conditions at the ordinary and special transitions, respectively, thereby enriching the critical GNY model. We develop a perturbative $4-\epsilon$ renormalization group approach to compute the boundary critical exponents. Our framework generalizes to other GNY universality class variants and provides theoretical predictions for experiments.</description>

      <title>Slow Oscillations of the Transverse Magnetoresistance in HoTe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow oscillations of the magnetoresistance periodic in the inverse magnetic field with a frequency of 3.4 T have been identified in HoTe3. The temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude is close to exponential even at low temperatures. This may be attributed to the existence of soft modes in the system and allows the estimation of the electron scattering rate on these modes. In the region of magnetic fields exceeding 1 T, the oscillations can be described as interference oscillations associated with the splitting of the band structure due to the bilayer structure of HoTe3. The obtained data have allowed us to calculate the ratio tb/tz of the hopping integrals between layers within each bilayer (tb) and between the adjacent bilayers (tz) to estimate these integrals as tb ~ 2 meV and tz ~ 0.26 meV.</description>

      <title>Enhanced anomalous Hall effect in the topological Kagome metal Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental physical phenomenon, achieving and controlling a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is crucial for advancing the understanding of topological physics and for developing applied technologies in spintronics. The recently discovered topological Kagome metal $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A =$ K, Rb, Cs)exhibits a significant AHE along with charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity, providing an ideal platform to study the interactions between nontrivial band topology, CDW, and superconductivity. In this study, we systematically investigated the evolution of CDW, superconductivity, and AHE in electron (Mn)-doped Cs(V$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$)$_3$Sb$_5$ single crystals. The experimental results show that electron doping rapidly suppresses superconductivity, while the CDW order remains relatively robust. Meanwhile, a significantly enhanced AHE, with a maximum anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) of ~25331 \Ohm ^{-1}\cm^{-1} and an anomalous Hall angle of 6.66% occurs at a relatively low doping level of $x = 0.03$. Based on the Tian-Ye-Jin (TYJ) scaling model, such a significant enhancement AHC is mainly dominated by the skew scattering. We speculated enhanced skew scattering between electrons and Mn originating from the strengthened spin-orbital coupling. Our finding provides important guidance for the design and development of transverse transport properties in topological Kagome materials.</description>

      <title>Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall effect in a chiral cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of quantum fluctuations in a chiral cavity on the quantum Hall (QH) state, extending previous studies of QH liquids in linearly polarized cavities. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation for perturbative cavity-matter interaction, we identify the system's normal modes, which correspond to the elementary excitations of the dressed electrons and photons. In contrast to the linear case, we find that the chiral cavity modifies the Kohn mode frequency by a contribution proportional to the cyclotron frequency, which can be interpreted as a renormalization of the magnetic field by cavity fluctuations. We show that the AC conductivities display cavity-induced corrections, including an isotropic quantum reactance effect and a rotating total-current response under applied AC fields. These findings are also derived from a hydrodynamic approach, which extends their validity to fractional quantum Hall states. Finally, we examine the role of finite cavity quality factor and find that while photon losses introduce resistive contributions to the impedance, these vanish in the DC limit. Our results provide insights into the interplay between quantum Hall states and chiral cavities, with significant implications for material engineering and cavity-induced topological effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) has emerged as a powerful tool for the extraction of useful quantum information from quantum devices. Here, we introduce the Subspace Noise Tailoring (SNT) algorithm, which efficiently combines the cheap cost of Symmetry Verification (SV) and low bias of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) QEM techniques. We study the performance of our method by simulating the Trotterized time evolution of the spin-1/2 Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) using a variety of local fermion-to-qubit encodings, which define a computational subspace through a set of stabilizers, the measurement of which can be used to post-select noisy quantum data. We study different combinations of QEM and encodings and uncover a rich phase diagram of optimal combinations, depending on the hardware performance, system size and available shot budget. We then demonstrate how SNT extends the reach of current noisy quantum computers in terms of the number of fermionic lattice sites and the number of Trotter steps, and quantify the required hardware performance beyond which a noisy device may outperform classical computational methods.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials composed of metal ions and organic linkers. Their diverse compositions and structures offer a wide range of applications, such as electrical conductivity and diffusion, which can be optimized by tuning the combination of different building blocks. The ease of modifying metal centers or organic linkers makes MOFs ideal for property prediction and inverse material design through computational modeling. Data science driven techniques can aid in the exploration of novel structures with optimize properties by employing machine learning models and using available simulation data in the literature. Here, we provide an extensive data collection with the simulation of MOFs, derived from the QMOF database, based on density-functional-theory, along with their corresponding tight-binding lattice Hamiltonian, offering insights into the electronic structure of each material. The topology information is augmented by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptors which are used as fingerprints of the local environment. Besides, the Extended Hubbard model is also used to describe a sub-set of MOFs with transition metals, where the Hubbard parameters intra-site U and inter-site V are computed. Due to the highly computational cost associated with the Hubbard calculations and the comprehensive amount of data for the tight-binding Hamiltonian, the database provided here stands as a significant contribution not only for the training of ML models to predict new properties but also to perform inverse design of new MOFs with enhanced target properties.</description>

      <title>Standardized test of many-body coherence in gate-based quantum platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence is a crucial resource in achieving quantum advantage over classical information processing, and more generally developing new quantum technologies. While its effects are observable in current quantum platforms, there are no standardized tools for systematically measuring and quantifying multi-qubit coherence across different gate-based quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a method to define a many-body quantum coherence length scale using anyon interference effects in a spin-chain setup, which effectively mirrors the problem of a quantum particle on a ring, with or without flux through it. We propose using the maximum length of the ring for which the presence or absence of flux can be clearly discerned, as a simple measure of the many-body quantum coherence grade (Q-grade) in a given quantum hardware. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented on gate-based quantum platforms to estimate and compare the quantum coherence of current devices, such as those from Google, IBM, IonQ, IQM, and Quantinuum that we considered here. This work aims to contribute to the creation of a live Web interface where the latest developments and advancements can be demonstrated, and progress in quantum coherence resources tracked over time. Establishing such a standardized quantum test would enable monitoring the growth of quantum coherence in gate-based quantum platforms, in a spirit similar to Moore's law.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a proposal by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>

      <title>Higher-form anomaly and long-range entanglement of mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open quantum systems, we directly relate anomalies of higher-form symmetries to the long-range entanglement of any mixed state with such symmetries. First, we define equivalence classes of long-range entanglement in mixed states via stochastic local channels (SLCs), which effectively ``mod out'' any classical correlations and thus distinguish phases by differences in long-range quantum correlations only. It is then shown that strong symmetries of a mixed state and their anomalies (non-trivial braiding and self-statistics) are intrinsic features of the entire phase of matter. For that, a general procedure of symmetry pullback for strong symmetries is introduced, whereby symmetries of the output state of an SLC are dressed into symmetries of the input state, with their anomaly relation preserved. This allows us to prove that states in (2+1)-D with anomalous strong 1-form symmetries exhibit long-range bipartite entanglement, and to establish a lower bound for their topological entanglement of formation, a mixed-state generalization of topological entanglement entropy. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to the toric code under Pauli-X and Z dephasing noise, as well as under ZX decoherence, which gives rise to the recently discovered intrinsically mixed-state topological order. Finally, we conjecture a connection between higher-form anomalies and long-range multipartite entanglement for mixed states in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Unified mechanism of charge-density-wave and high-$T_c$ superconductivity protected from oxygen vacancies in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional charge and spin density-wave states are commonly observed in bilayer nickelates, drawing considerable attention due to their proximity to high-$T_c$ superconductivity in various phase diagrams. However, the nature and mechanisms of charge and spin density-waves (DWs) in nickelates remain poorly understood. Numerous experiments have reported that the charge-density-wave (CDW) transition temperature $T_{ cdw}$ and the spin-density-wave (SDW) transition temperature $T_{sdw}$ are closely related but distinct. However, in contrast to these experiments, previous mean-field-type analyses have yielded only a simple SDW phase. To resolve this key problem, this paper demonstrates that sizable CDW instabilities emerge in proportion to the SDW instability in La$3$Ni$2$O$7$.This behavior is driven by the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism, which captures important electron correlations beyond mean-field theory. Therefore, (i) experimental CDW + SDW coexisting state is naturally explained. In addition, (ii) the CDW + SDW fluctuations cooperatively drive high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Notably, the predicted $s$-wave SC state is robust against the inner apical O vacancies. Furthermore, (iii) the CDW instability is highly sensitive to the size of the $d_{z^2}$-orbital hole pocket, allowing for the realization of CDW quantum criticality through carrier-doping and pressure application. We find that the coexistence of charge and spin fluctuations is essential in bilayer nickelates, with both playing a cooperative role in mediating high-$T_c$ superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Realization of fermionic Laughlin state on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated topological phases of matter are central to modern condensed matter physics and quantum information technology but often challenging to probe and control in material systems. The experimental difficulty of accessing these phases has motivated the use of engineered quantum platforms for simulation and manipulation of exotic topological states. Among these, the Laughlin state stands as a cornerstone for topological matter, embodying fractionalization, anyonic excitations, and incompressibility. Although its bosonic analogs have been realized on programmable quantum simulators, a genuine fermionic Laughlin state has yet to be demonstrated on a quantum processor. Here, we realize the {\nu} = 1/3 fermionic Laughlin state on IonQ's Aria-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using an efficient and scalable Hamiltonian variational ansatz with 369 two-qubit gates on a 16-qubit circuit. Employing symmetry-verification error mitigation, we extract key observables that characterize the Laughlin state, including correlation hole and chiral edge modes, with strong agreement to exact diagonalization benchmarks. This work establishes a scalable quantum framework to simulate material-intrinsic topological orders and provides a starting point to explore its dynamics and excitations on digital quantum processors.</description>

      <title>From Light-Cone to Supersonic Propagation of Correlations by Competing Short- and Long-Range Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical spreading of correlations in many-body quantum systems with competing short- and global-range couplings. We monitor the non-equilibrium dynamics of the correlations following a quench, showing that for strong short-range couplings the propagation of correlations is dominated at short and intermediate distances by a causal, light-cone, dynamics, resembling the purely short-range quantum systems. However, the interplay of short- and global-range couplings leads to a crossover between space-time regions in which the light-cone persists to regions where a supersonic, distance-independent, spreading of the correlations occurs. We identify the important ingredients needed for capturing the supersonic spreading and demonstrate our findings in systems of interacting bosonic atoms, in which the global range coupling is realized by a coupling to a cavity light field, or atomic long-range interactions, respectively. We show that our results hold in both one and two dimensions and in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we characterize the short time power-law scaling of the distance-independent growth of the density-density correlations.</description>

      <title>Engineering Moir\'e Kagome Superlattices in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to achieve breathing kagome moir\'e superlattices using three twisted layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. In this scheme, the top and bottom layers are twisted relative to the middle layer by small angles $\theta$ and 2$\theta$ respectively, generating a kagome-like moir\'e potential for the middle layer with suitable parameters. The moir\'e band structures of these systems are calculated within the continuum model and show good resemblance to the breathing kagome band structure, including the flat band, Dirac points with tunable gap, and van Hove singularities. This system serves as a new venue to explore strongly correlated physics on kagome lattices which offers more flexibility and tunability in band structure, charge density, and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Emergent Chiral Metal near a Kondo Breakdown Quantum Phase Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The destruction of the Kondo effect in a local-moment metal can lead to a topological non-Fermi-liquid phase, dubbed fractionalized Fermi liquid, with spinon-type excitations and an emergent gauge field. We demonstrate that, if the latter displays an internal $\pi$-flux structure, a chiral heavy-fermion metal emerges near the Kondo-breakdown transition. Utilizing a parton mean-field theory describing the transition between a conventional heavy Fermi liquid and a U(1) fractionalized Fermi liquid, we find a novel intermediate phase near the transition whose emergent flux pattern spontaneously breaks both translation and time-reversal symmetries. This phase is an orbital antiferromagnet, and we derive a Landau-type theory which shows that such a phase generically emerges from a $\pi$-flux spin liquid. We discuss the relevance to pertinent experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18820v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of topological phases posits that two phases with identical symmetries are separated by a bulk phase transition, while symmetry breaking provides a path in parameter space that allows adiabatic connection between the phases. Typically, if symmetry is broken only at the boundary, topological surface states become gapped, and single-particle surface properties no longer distinguish between the two phases. In this work, we challenge this expectation. We demonstrate that the single-particle surface Green's function contains zeros, or "Luttinger surfaces," which maintain the same bulk-boundary correspondence as topological surface states. Remarkably, these Luttinger surfaces persist under symmetry-breaking perturbations that destroy the surface states. Moreover, we point out that low-energy and surface theories, often used synonymously in discussions of (gapped) topological matter, are actually different, with the difference captured by the Luttinger surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies of nonlocal effective theories that supposedly describe symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy. We view the nonlocal effective theories including the simplest Lagrangian and its two-pole variant associated with a gapless Dirac zero as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomaly, we discuss the global anomaly, the bulk-boundary correspondence, and the constraint on possible phases, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory studied by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-$T_c$ cuprates are characterized by strong spin fluctuations, which give rise to antiferromagnetic and pseudogap phases and may be key to the high superconducting critical temperatures observed in these materials. Experimental studies have revealed significant changes in the Hall coefficient $R_H$ across these phases, a phenomenon closely related to both spin fluctuations and changes in the Fermi surface morphology. Using the perturbation correction to Gaussian approximation (PCGA), we investigate the two-dimensional(2D) square-lattice single-band Hubbard model and obtain the self-energy with a finite imaginary part due to scattering. We calculate the density dependence of the Hall number $n_H=1/(qR_H)$. For small hole (or electron) doping $p$ (or $x$), our numerical results show that $n_H$ transitions from $p$ to $1+p$ for hole-doped systems, and from $-x$ to $1-x$ for electron-doped systems -- both in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between phase boundaries and the observed peculiar changes in the Hall number.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic insulator Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ has been previously proposed to realize the highly frustrated breathing kagome lattice model. We report a combination of single-crystal neutron scattering studies and numerical simulations that debunk this interpretation. We show that it is the inter-plane couplings that determine the physics. To explain the exotic magnetism, we derive a simple one-dimensional Ising model composed of twisted triangular spin-tubes, i.e., triple braids of Ising spin chains with almost-orthogonal anisotropy frames and competing ferro-antiferromagnetic interactions. This model can account for the ground state, excitations, the numerous field-induced fractional magnetization plateau phases and incommensurate magnetic correlations at elevated temperatures. Nd$_3$BWO$_9$ constitutes a rare example where rich magnetic phenomena can be understood and simulated quantitatively in terms of a simple classical Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: Kitaev quantum spin liquids (KSLs) in layered honeycomb magnets are known to host Majorana quasiparticles, whose excitations depend strongly on the direction of the applied magnetic field. In the high-field phase of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, specific heat measurements have revealed characteristic field-angle dependence of low-energy excitations consistent with the Kitaev model, providing bulk evidence for the KSL state. Here we present low-temperature measurements of specific heat $C(T)$ for another KSL candidate $\textrm{Na}_2\textrm{Co}_2\textrm{Te}\textrm{O}_6$ (NCTO) under field rotation within the honeycomb plane. Above the critical field of antiferromagnetic order, the field-angle dependence of $C/T$ exhibits minima along the bond directions, contrasting with the maxima observed in the KSL state of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Our analysis indicates nodeless, fully-gapped excitations, which are inconsistent with the angle-dependent Majorana excitations with gapless nodes predicted by the Kitaev model. These findings suggest that low-energy excitations in NCTO are governed by gapped magnon excitations rather than Majorana quasiparticles, providing thermodynamic evidence against a KSL state.</description>

Abstract: The structure factor is a useful observable for probing charge density correlations in real materials, and its long-wavelength behavior encapsulated by ``quantum weight'' has recently gained prominence in the study of quantum geometry and topological phases of matter. Here we employ the static structure factor, S(q), to explore the phase diagram of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically tMoTe2, at filling factors n=1/3, 2/3 under varying displacement fields. Our results reveal a topological phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a generalized Wigner crystal (GWC). This transition is marked by the appearance of Bragg peaks at charge-density-wave vectors, and simultaneously, large decrease of S(q) at small q which lowers the interaction energy. We further calculate the quantum weight of various FCI states, verifying the universal topological bound. Our findings provide new insights into the phase diagram of twisted TMDs and establish a general framework for characterizing topological phases through structure factor analysis.</description>

      <title>Cubic Dirac Semimetals: General Theory and Application to Rare-Earth Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetry exhibit unique topological properties. However, the origin of these behaviors remains presently unclear. Here, we develop minimal models for Dirac semimetals (DSMs) with accidental band crossings and higher-order topology in cubic systems, incorporating candidate magnetic order to analyze bulk, surface, and hinge state characteristics. In certain cubic-symmetric DSMs, we identify an effective Z2 chiral symmetry which significantly impacts surface and hinge-localized states. Our results highlight distinct features in surface state dispersions, Fermi arcs, polarization dependence, and band splitting that correlate with photoemission data in rare-earth monopnictides. We also suggest candidate materials and experimental tests for further validation. These findings advance our understanding of surface states in rare-earth magnets with parent cubic symmetries and illuminate the role of DSM physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Topological Non-Fermi Liquid Phases in a Modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Long-Range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the emergence of a topological non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase in a modified Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain model subjected to long-range interactions characterized by the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model. While Fermi liquid theory has been instrumental in understanding low temperature properties of metals, it fails to account for the complex behaviors exhibited by strongly correlated systems, where interactions lead to emergent phenomena such as non-Fermi liquid behavior. Our analysis reveals that the SSH-HK model supports a rich ground state phase diagram, exhibiting distinct NFL phases marked by many body Zak phases of $2\pi$ and $0$, corresponding to topological and trivial NFL states, respectively. We demonstrate that the topological NFL state manifests unique electronic polarization characteristics akin to those in the non-interacting SSH model. Through exact diagonalization of the interacting SSH-HK Hamiltonian, we explore the spectral functions and density of states, revealing significant departures from traditional quasiparticle behavior in various particle number sectors. Our findings extend the understanding of topological non-Fermi liquids and their potential implications for high-temperature superconductivity and other correlated electron systems, highlighting the intricate interplay between topology and strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study on pressure-induced valence instability of CeCoSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth compounds RCoSi exhibit unique properties, with distinct structural behaviors depending on whether R is a light, middle or heavy rare-earth element. Among them, CeCoSi undergoes a structural phase transition under high pressure, with the phase transition pressure increasing as temperature rises. Some experimental studies suggest that the transition is closely related to the behavior of Ce-4f electrons. In this work, we systematically studied the evolution of the electronic structure of CeCoSi with temperature and pressure. First, we used the DFT+DMFT to calculate the energy-volume curve of CeCoSi, which was in good agreement with the experimental results and far superior to the DFT method. Next, we studied the electronic structure of CeCoSi under different pressures and temperatures using DFT+DMFT. Our results show that CeCoSi is a Kondo metal with hybridization of Ce-4f and Co-3d. As pressure increases, the renormalization factor Z of Ce-4f5/2 increases, the occupancy number of Ce-4f electrons decreases, and CeCoSi transitions to a mixed-valence state at ~5.5 GPa in 100 K. The pressure of the quantum phase transition PQ is slightly higher than the experimentally observed structural phase transition pressure PS, and the PQ increases with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the behavior of PS in experiment. In addition, the hybridization strength of Ce-4f in the mixed-valence state is significantly greater than in the Kondo metal state. Our results suggest that the valence instability of Ce-4f is the cause of the structural phase transition. As pressure increases, Ce-4f electrons delocalize and CeCoSi transitions to mixed-valence state. This valence instability may cause redistribution of electron density, thus inducing a structural phase transition. Our work reveals the cause of the structural phase transition of CeCoSi under high pressure.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging and self-dualities of the $XX$ model and its cousins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the one-dimensional $XX$ lattice model and its cousins through the lens of momentum and winding $U(1)$ symmetries. We distinguish two closely related $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries based on their relation to the $U(1)$ symmetries, and establish a web of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging relations among these models, rooted in two fundamental seeds: the $ XY \pm YX$ models. These two seeds, each self-dual under gauging of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetries, possess manifestly symmetric conserved charges, making transparent the connection between the noninvertible symmetries and the Kramers-Wannier duality. By leveraging the self-dualities of these two seed models, we derive the self-dualities of their cousins, including the $XX$ model and the Levin-Gu model, through appropriate gauging procedures. Moreover, under these gauging schemes, the lattice T-duality matrices take the form of the identity matrix. Finally, we unify the mapping structures of local conserved charges across these models, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding their symmetries and dualities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and beyond in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the phase diagram of the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Fermi-Hubbard model on the square lattice to gain a more comprehensive understanding of this correlated model at half filling. This model has recently become a prominent topic of research because it hosts altermagnetic phases. Using mean-field analysis, we identify four metallic phases and two insulating phases with nontrivial magnetic orders at an intermediate value of $\delta = 0.5$, presenting a rich ground-state phase diagram in the $U$-$t^\prime$ plane. We also highlight the distinct features of the Fermi surface topology for each metallic phase. To go beyond the mean-field theory, we employ the density-matrix renormalization group method to simulate the ground state numerically. The phase boundaries are determined from the discontinuities and peaks in the entanglement entropy and magnetizations. In addition to the phases identified in the mean-field theory, we find a valence-bond solid state in a narrow intermediate-$t'$ region. Our work offers a firm step forward in understanding the complex behaviors of correlated electrons in the $t$-$t^\prime$-$\delta$ Hubbard model over a large parameter space.</description>

Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems can exhibit possibilities beyond what can be obtained in equilibrium. Both in Floquet systems and in the related problems of discrete-time quantum walks and quantum cellular automata, a basic distinction arises among unitary time evolution operators: while all physical operators are local, not all are locally generated (i.e., generated by some local Hamiltonian). In this paper, we define the notion of equivalence up to a locally generated unitary in all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. We then classify noninteracting unitaries in all dimensions on this basis by showing that equivalence up to a locally generated unitary is identical to homotopy equivalence.</description>

      <title>Solvable entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits with generalized space-time duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of kicked Ising models in $1+1$ dimensions which have interactions alternating between odd and even bonds in time. These models can be understood as quantum circuits tiling space-time with the generalized space-time dual properties of tri-unitarity (three "arrows of time") at the global level, and also second-level dual-unitarity at the local level, which constrains the behavior of pairs of local gates underlying the circuit under a space-time rotation. We identify a broad class of initial product states wherein the effect of the environment on a small subsystem can be exactly represented by influence matrices with simple Markovian structures, resulting in the subsystem's full dynamics being efficiently computable. We further find additional conditions under which the dynamics of entanglement can be solved for all times, yielding rich phenomenology ranging from linear growth at half the maximal speed allowed by locality, followed by saturation to maximum entropy (i.e., thermalization to infinite temperature); to entanglement growth with saturation to extensive but sub-maximal entropy. Intriguingly, for certain parameter regimes, we find a nonchaotic class of dynamics which is neither integrable nor Clifford, exemplified by nonzero operator entanglement growth but with a spectral form factor which exhibits large, apparently time-quasiperiodic revivals.</description>

      <title>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <title>Variational Mapping of Chern Bands to Landau Levels: Application to Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of mapping between Chern bands and generalized Landau levels in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), where fractional Chern insulators down to zero magnetic fields have been observed. We construct an exact Landau-level representation of moir\'e bands, where the basis functions, characterized by a uniform quantum geometry, are derived from Landau-level wavefunctions dressed by spinors aligned or antialigned with the layer pseudospin skyrmion field. We further generalize the dressed zeroth Landau level to a variational wavefunction with an ideal yet nonuniform quantum geometry and variationally maximize its weight in the first moir\'e band. The variational wavefunction has a high overlap with the first band and quantitatively captures the exact diagonalization spectra of fractional Chern insulators at hole-filling factors $\nu_h=2/3$ and $3/5$, providing a clear theoretical mechanism for the formation and properties of the fractionalized states. Our work introduces a variational approach to studying fractional states by mapping Chern bands to Landau levels, with application to other systems beyond $t$MoTe$_2$ also demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: Consider a renormalization group flow preserving a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_1$. If it flows to a rational conformal field theory, the surviving symmetry $\mathcal S_1$ flows to a pre-modular fusion category $\mathcal S_2$ with monoidal functor $F:\mathcal S_1\to\mathcal S_2$. By clarifying mathematical (especially category theoretical) meaning of renormalization group domain wall/interface or boundary condition, we find the hidden extended vertex operator (super)algebra gives a unique (up to braided equivalence) completely $(\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2)'$-anisotropic representative of the Witt equivalence class $[\mathcal S_1\boxtimes\mathcal S_2]$. The mathematical conjecture is supported physically, and passes various tests in concrete examples including non/unitary minimal models, and Wess-Zumino-Witten models. In particular, the conjecture holds beyond diagonal cosets.
  The picture also establishes the conjectured half-integer condition, which fixes infrared conformal dimensions mod $\frac12$. It further leads to the double braiding relation, namely braiding structures jump at conformal fixed points. As an application, we solve the flow from the $E$-type minimal model $(A_{10},E_6)\to M(4,3)$.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>
