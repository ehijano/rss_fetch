      <title>Learning the Exact SABR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility surfaces and Caps/Floors prices for any maturity and strike with negligible computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for daily trading and risk management activities.</description>

      <title>Mean-Reverting SABR Models: Closed-form Surfaces and Calibration for Equities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07766v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider three stochastic-volatility models, each characterized by distinct dynamics of instantaneous volatility: (1) a CIR process for squared volatility (i.e., the classical Heston model); (2) a mean-reverting lognormal process for volatility; and (3) a CIR process for volatility. Previous research has provided semi-analytical approximations for these models in the form of simple (non-mean-reverting) SABR models, each suitably parameterized for a given expiry.
  First, using a computer algebra system, we derive closed-form expressions for these semi-analytical approximations, under the assumption that all parameters remain constant (but without the constraint of constant expected volatility). Although the resulting formulas are considerably lengthier than those in simpler SABR models, they remain tractable and are easily implementable even in Excel.
  Second, employing these closed-form expressions, we calibrate the three models to empirical volatility surfaces observed in EuroStoxx index options. The calibration is well-behaved and achieves excellent fits for the observed equity-volatility surfaces, with only five parameters per surface. Consequently, the approximate models offer a simpler, faster, and (numerically) more reliable alternative to the classical Heston model, or to more advanced models, which lack closed-form solutions and can be numerically challenging, particularly in less sophisticated implementation environments.
  Third, we examine the stability and correlations of our parameter estimates. In this analysis, we identify certain issues with the models - one of which appears to stem from the sub-lognormal behavior of the actual equity-volatility process. Notably, the CIR-volatility model (3), as opposed to the CIR-variance Heston model (1), seems to best capture this behavior, and also results in more stable parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Pricing Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Heisenberg's observable-only stance, we replace latent "information" (filtrations, hidden diffusions, state variables) with observable transitions between price states. On a discrete price lattice with a Hilbert-space representation, shift operators and the spectral calculus of the price define observable frequency operators and a translation-invariant convolution generator. Combined with jump operators that encode transition intensities, this yields a completely positive, translation-covariant Lindblad semigroup. Under the risk-neutral condition the framework leads to a nonlocal pricing equation that is diagonal in Fourier space; in the small-mesh diffusive limit its generator converges to the classical Black-Scholes-Merton operator.
  We do not propose another parametric model. We propose a foundation for model construction that is observable, first-principles, and mathematically natural. Noncommutativity emerges from the observable shift algebra rather than being postulated. The jump-intensity ledger determines tail behavior and short-maturity smiles and implies testable links between extreme-event probabilities and implied-volatility wings. Future directions: (i) multi-asset systems on higher-dimensional lattices with vector shifts and block kernels; (ii) state- or flow-dependent kernels as "financial interactions" leading to nonlinear master equations while preserving linear risk-neutral pricing; (iii) empirical tests of the predicted scaling relations between jump intensities and market extremes.</description>

      <title>Occupied Processes: Going with the Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07936v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A stochastic process $X$ becomes \textit{occupied} when it is enlarged with its occupation flow $\mathcal{O}$, which tracks the time spent by the path at each level. Crucially, the occupied process $(\mathcal{O},X)$ enjoys a Markov structure when $X$ is Markov. We develop a novel It\^o calculus for occupied processes that lies midway between Dupire's functional It\^o calculus and the classical version. We derive a surprisingly simple It\^o formula and, through Feynman-Kac, unveil a broad class of path-dependent PDEs where $\mathcal{O}$ plays the role of time. The space variable, given by the current value of $X$, remains finite-dimensional, thereby paving the way for standard elliptic PDE techniques and numerical methods. In the financial applications, we demonstrate that occupation flows provide unified Markovian lifts for exotic options and variance instruments, allowing financial institutions to price and manage derivatives books with a single numerical solver. We then explore avenues in financial modeling where volatility is driven by the occupied process. In particular, we propose the local occupied volatility (LOV) model which not only calibrates to European vanilla options but also offers the flexibility to capture stylized facts of volatility or fit other instruments. We also present an extension of forward variance models that leverages the entire forward occupation surface.</description>
