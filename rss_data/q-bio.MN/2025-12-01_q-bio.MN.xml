      <title>A Spectral Koopman Approximation Framework for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) are a general class of continuous-time Markov jump processes used to model a wide range of systems, including biochemical dynamics in single cells, ecological and epidemiological populations, and queueing or communication networks. Yet analyzing their dynamics remains challenging because these processes are high-dimensional and their transient behavior can vary substantially across different initial molecular or population states. Here we introduce a spectral framework for the stochastic Koopman operator that provides a tractable, low-dimensional representation of SRN dynamics over continuous time, together with computable error estimates. By exploiting the compactness of the Koopman operator, we recover dominant spectral modes directly from simulated or experimental data, enabling efficient prediction of moments, event probabilities, and other summary statistics across all initial states. We further derive continuous-time parameter sensitivities and cross-spectral densities, offering new tools for probing noise structure and frequency-domain behavior. We demonstrate the approach on biologically relevant systems, including synthetic intracellular feedback controllers, stochastic oscillators, and inference of initial-state distributions from high-temporal-resolution flow cytometry. Together, these results establish spectral Koopman analysis as a powerful and general framework for studying stochastic dynamical systems across the biological, ecological, and computational sciences.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Models of Resource Allocation in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyses of a stochastic model of a chemical reaction network with three types of chemical species ${\cal R}$, ${\cal M}$ and ${\cal U}$ that interact to transform a flow of external resources, the chemical species ${\cal Q}$, to produce a product, the chemical species ${\cal P}_r$. A regulation mechanism involving the sequestration of the chemical species ${\cal R}$ when the flow of resources is too low is investigated. The original motivation of the study is of analyzing the qualitative properties of a key regulation mechanism of gene expression in biological cells, the {\em stringent response}.
  A scaling analysis of a Markov process in $\N^5$ representing the state of the chemical reaction network is achieved. It is shown that, depending on the parameters of the model, there are, quite surprisingly, three possible asymptotic regimes. To each of them corresponds a stochastic averaging principle with a fast process expressed in terms of a network of $M/M/\infty$ queues. One of these regimes, the optimal sequestration regime, does not seem to have been identified up to now. Under this regime, the input flow of resources is low but the state of the network is still acceptable in terms of unused macro-molecules, showing the remarkable efficiency of this regulation mechanism. The technical proofs of the main convergence results rely on a combination of coupling arguments, technical estimates of the solutions of SDEs, of sample paths of fast processes in particular, and the stability properties of some dynamical systems in $\R^2$.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Zero-one Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-one biochemical reaction networks are widely recognized for their importance in analyzing signal transduction and cellular decision-making processes. Degenerate networks reveal non-standard behaviors and mark the boundary where classical methods fail. Their analysis is key to understanding exceptional dynamical phenomena in biochemical systems. Therefore, we focus on investigating the degeneracy of zero-one reaction networks. It is known that one-dimensional zero-one networks cannot degenerate. In this work, we identify all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system is equivalent to a binomial system.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Direct Targeting and Regulation of RNA Polymerase II by Cell Signaling Kinases"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.</description>
