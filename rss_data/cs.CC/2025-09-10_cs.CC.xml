      <title>Existence and nonexistence of commutativity gadgets for entangled CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commutativity gadgets allow NP-hardness proofs for classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) to be carried over to undecidability proofs for the corresponding entangled CSPs. This has been done, for instance, for NP-complete boolean CSPs and 3-colouring in the work of Culf and Mastel. For many CSPs over larger alphabets, including $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$, it is not known whether or not commutativity gadgets exist, or if the entangled CSP is decidable. In this paper, we study commutativity gadgets and prove the first known obstruction to their existence. We do this by extending the definition of the quantum automorphism group of a graph to the quantum endomorphism monoid of a CSP, and showing that a CSP with non-classical quantum endomorphism monoid does not admit a commutativity gadget. In particular, this shows that no commutativity gadget exists for $k$-colouring when $k \geq 4$. However, we construct a commutativity gadget for an alternate way of presenting $k$-colouring as a nonlocal game, the oracular setting.
  Furthermore, we prove an easy to check sufficient condition for the quantum endomorphism monoid to be non-classical, extending a result of Schmidt for the quantum automorphism group of a graph, and use this to give examples of CSPs that do not admit a commutativity gadget. We also show that existence of oracular commutativity gadgets is preserved under categorical powers of graphs; existence of commutativity gadgets and oracular commutativity gadgets is equivalent for graphs with no four-cycle; and that the odd cycles and the odd graphs have a commutative quantum endomorphism monoid, leaving open the possibility that they might admit a commutativity gadget.</description>

      <title>Verification power of rational-valued automata with deterministic and affine states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the verification power of rational-valued affine automata within Arthur--Merlin proof systems. For one-way verifiers, we give real-time protocols with perfect completeness and tunable bounded error for two benchmark nonregular languages, the balanced-middle language and the centered-palindrome language, illustrating a concrete advantage over probabilistic and quantum finite-state verifiers. For two-way verifiers, we first design a weak protocol that verifies every Turing-recognizable language by streaming and checking a configuration history. We then strengthen it with a probabilistic continuation check that bounds the prover's transcript length and ensures halting with high probability, yielding strong verification with expected running time proportional to the product of the simulated machine's space and time (up to input length and a factor polynomial in the inverse error parameter). Combining these constructions with standard alternation--space correspondences, we place alternating exponential time, equivalently deterministic exponential space, inside affine Arthur--Merlin with two-way affine automata. We also present a reduction-based route with perfect completeness via a Knapsack-game verifier, which, together with linear-space reductions, yields that the class PSPACE admits affine Arthur--Merlin verification by two-way affine automata. Two simple primitives drive our protocols: a probabilistic continuation check to control expected time and a restart-on-accept affine register that converts exact algebraic checks into eventually halting bounded-error procedures.</description>

      <title>Discreteness of asymptotic tensor ranks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters.
  We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points.
  Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
  Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.</description>

      <title>Computing the Elementary Symmetric Polynomials in Positive Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first extend the results of Chatterjee, Kumar, Shi, Volk (Computational Complexity 2022) by showing that the degree $d$ elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables have formula lower bounds of $\Omega(d(n-d))$ over fields of positive characteristic. Then, we show that the results of the universality of the symmetric model from Shpilka (Journal of Computer and System Sciences 2002) and the results about border fan-in two $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuits from Kumar (ACM Trans. Comput. Theory 2020) over zero characteristic fields do not extend to fields of positive characteristic. In particular, we show that * There are polynomials that cannot be represented as linear projections of the elementary symmetric polynomials (in fact, we show that they cannot be represented as the sum of $k$ such projections for a fixed $k$) and * There are polynomials that cannot be computed by border depth-$3$ circuits of top fan-in $k$, called $\overline{\Sigma^{[k]}\Pi\Sigma}$, for $k = o(n)$.
  To prove the first result, we consider a geometric property of the elementary symmetric polynomials, namely, the set of all points in which the polynomial and all of its first-order partial derivatives vanish. It was shown in Meckler, Zaimi and Limaye, Mittal, Pareek that the dimension of this space was exactly $d-2$ for fields of zero characteristic. We extend this to fields of positive characteristic by showing that this dimension must be between $d-2$ and $d-1$. In fact, we show this bound is tight.
  Then, to consider the border top fan-in of the symmetric model and depth-$3$ circuits (sometimes called border affine Chow rank), we show that it is sufficient to consider the border top fan-in of the sum of linear projections of the elementary symmetric polynomials. This is done by constructing an explicit metapolynomial to check the condition, meaning that this result also applies in the border setting.</description>

      <title>Linear Matroid Intersection is in Catalytic Logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear matroid intersection is an important problem in combinatorial optimization. Given two linear matroids over the same ground set, the linear matroid intersection problem asks you to find a common independent set of maximum size. The deep interest in linear matroid intersection is due to the fact that it generalises many classical problems in theoretical computer science, such as bipartite matching, edge disjoint spanning trees, rainbow spanning tree, and many more.
  We study this problem in the model of catalytic computation: space-bounded machines are granted access to \textit{catalytic space}, which is additional working memory that is full with arbitrary data that must be preserved at the end of its computation.
  Although linear matroid intersection has had a polynomial time algorithm for over 50 years, it remains an important open problem to show that linear matroid intersection belongs to any well studied subclass of $\mathsf{P}$. We address this problem for the class catalytic logspace ($\mathsf{CL}$) with a polynomial time bound ($\mathsf{CLP}$).
  Recently, Agarwala and Mertz (2025) showed that bipartite maximum matching can be computed in the class $\mathsf{CLP}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$. This was the first subclass of $\mathsf{P}$ shown to contain bipartite matching, and additionally the first problem outside $\mathsf{TC}^1$ shown to be contained in $\mathsf{CL}$. We significantly improve the result of Agarwala and Mertz by showing that linear matroid intersection can be computed in $\mathsf{CLP}$.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of the word problem of the R. Thompson group V</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the proof by Lehnert and Schweitzer that the word problem of the Thompson group V is co-context-free, and we show that this word problem is the complement of the cyclic closure of a union of reverse deterministic context-free languages. The same is true for any finitely generated subgroup of V. For certain finite generating sets, this word problem is the complement of the cyclic closure of the union of four deterministic context-free languages. Therefore the word problem of V has quadratic time-complexity on a deterministic multitape Turing machine, and belongs to logDCFL.</description>

      <title>Deciding One to One property of Boolean maps: Condition and algorithm in terms of implicants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07788v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the computational problem of deciding invertibility (or one to one-ness) of a Boolean map $F$ in $n$-Boolean variables. This problem is a special case of deciding invertibilty of a map $F:\mathbb{F}_{q}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_{q}^n$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ for $q=2$. Algebraic condition for invertibility of $F$ is well known to be equivalent to invertibility of the Koopman operator of $F$ as shown in \cite{RamSule}. In this paper a condition for invertibility is derived in the special case of Boolean maps $F:B_0^n\rightarrow B_0^n$ where $B_0$ is the two element Boolean algebra in terms of \emph{implicants} of Boolean equations defined by the map. This condition is then extended to the case of general maps in $n$ variables and $m\geq n$ equations. Hence this condition answers the special case of invertibility of maps $F$ defined over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$ alternatively, in terms of implicants instead of the Koopman operator. The problem of deciding invertibility of a map $F$ (or that of finding its Garden of Eden (GOE)) over finite fields is distinct from the satisfiability problem (SAT) or the problem of deciding consistency of polynomial equations over finite fields. Hence the well known algorithms for deciding SAT or of solvability using Grobner basis for checking membership in an ideal generated by polynomials is not known to answer the question of invertibility of a map. Similarly it appears that algorithms for satisfiability or polynomial solvability are not useful for computation of GOE of $F$ even for maps over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$.</description>

      <title>On the Unprovability of Circuit Size Bounds in Intuitionistic $\mathsf{S}^1_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11841v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $k$ such that Buss's intuitionistic theory $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$ does not prove that SAT requires co-nondeterministic circuits of size at least $n^k$. To our knowledge, this is the first unconditional unprovability result in bounded arithmetic in the context of worst-case fixed-polynomial size circuit lower bounds. We complement this result by showing that the upper bound $\mathsf{NP} \subseteq \mathsf{coNSIZE}[n^k]$ is unprovable in $\mathsf{IS}^1_2$.

In order to establish our main result, we obtain new unconditional lower bounds against refuters that might be of independent interest. In particular, we show that there is no efficient refuter for the lower bound $\mathsf{NP} \nsubseteq \mathsf{i.o.}\text{-}\mathsf{coNP}/\mathsf{poly}$, addressing in part a question raised by Atserias (2006).</description>

      <title>On the quantum computational complexity of classical linear dynamics with geometrically local interactions: Dequantization and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of large-scale classical systems in exponentially small space on quantum computers has gained attention. The prior work demonstrated that a quantum algorithm offers an exponential speedup over any classical algorithm in simulating classical dynamics with long-range interactions. However, many real-world classical systems, such as those arising from partial differential equations, exhibit only local interactions. The question remains whether quantum algorithms can still provide exponential speedup under this condition. In this work, we thoroughly characterize the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for simulating such geometrically local systems. First, we dequantize the quantum algorithm for simulating short-time (polynomial-time) dynamics of such systems. This implies that the problem of simulating this dynamics does not yield any exponential quantum advantage. Second, we show that quantum algorithms for short-time dynamics have the same computational complexity as polynomial-time probabilistic classical computation. Third, we show that the computational complexity of quantum algorithms for long-time (exponential-time) dynamics is captured by exponential-time and polynomial-space quantum computation. This suggests a super-polynomial time advantage when restricting the computation to polynomial-space, or an exponential space advantage otherwise. This work offers new insights into the complexity of classical dynamics governed by partial differential equations, providing a pathway for achieving quantum advantage in practical problems.</description>

      <title>Another generalization of Hadamard test: Optimal sample complexities for learning functions on the unitary group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating properties of unknown unitary operations is a fundamental task in quantum information science. While full unitary tomography requires a number of samples to the unknown unitary scaling linearly with the dimension (implying exponentially with the number of qubits), estimating specific functions of a unitary can be significantly more efficient. In this paper, we present a unified framework for the sample-efficient estimation of arbitrary square integrable functions $f: \mathbf{U}(d) \to \mathbb{C}$, using only access to the controlled-unitary operation. We first provide a tight characterization of the optimal sample complexity when the accuracy is measured by the averaged bias over the unitary $\mathbf{U}(d)$. We then construct a sample-efficient estimation algorithm that becomes optimal under the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning criterion for various classes of functions.
  Applications include optimal estimation of matrix elements of irreducible representations, the trace, determinant, and general polynomial functions on $\mathbf{U}(d)$. Our technique generalize the Hadamard test and leverage tools from representation theory, yielding both lower and upper bound on sample complexity.</description>
