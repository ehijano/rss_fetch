      <title>Optimizing BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Code, with OpenMP/OpenACC and GPU Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the path toward developing the first fusion energy devices, plasma simulations have become indispensable tools for supporting the design and development of fusion machines. Among these critical simulation tools, BIT1 is an advanced Particle-in-Cell code with Monte Carlo collisions, specifically designed for modeling plasma-material interaction and, in particular, analyzing the power load distribution on tokamak divertors. The current implementation of BIT1 relies exclusively on MPI for parallel communication and lacks support for GPUs. In this work, we address these limitations by designing and implementing a hybrid, shared-memory version of BIT1 capable of utilizing GPUs. For shared-memory parallelization, we rely on OpenMP and OpenACC, using a task-based approach to mitigate load-imbalance issues in the particle mover. On an HPE Cray EX computing node, we observe an initial performance improvement of approximately 42%, with scalable performance showing an enhancement of about 38% when using 8 MPI ranks. Still relying on OpenMP and OpenACC, we introduce the first version of BIT1 capable of using GPUs. We investigate two different data movement strategies: unified memory and explicit data movement. Overall, we report BIT1 data transfer findings during each PIC cycle. Among BIT1 GPU implementations, we demonstrate performance improvement through concurrent GPU utilization, especially when MPI ranks are assigned to dedicated GPUs. Finally, we analyze the performance of the first BIT1 GPU porting with the NVIDIA Nsight tools to further our understanding of BIT1 computational efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations, capable of exploiting current supercomputer infrastructures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a confining ring potential with a Gaussian profile. By introducing a rotating sinusoidal perturbation, we numerically highlight the nucleation of quantum vortices in a particular regime throughout the dynamics. Numerical computations are made via a Strang splitting time integration and a two-point flux approximation Finite Volume scheme based on a particular admissible triangulation. We also develop numerical algorithms for vortex tracking adapted to our finite volume framework.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of a family of solitary-wave solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by third-, and fourth-order dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solitary wave solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by the effects of third-, and fourth-order dispersion, maintaining a wavenumber gap between the solitary waves and the propagation constant. We numerically construct members of a family of such solitary waves, including Kruglov and Harvey's exact solution, using the spectral renormalization method and establish empirical relations between the pulse parameters. A deeper insight into the properties of solitary waves and solitons can be obtained through collisions. Therefore we perform pulse propagation simulations demonstrating different collision regimes. Depending on the pulses initial phase difference, this can lead to the formation of short-lived two-pulse bound states. While these collisions are generally inelastic, singular phase values exist at which they are elastic. Finally, we detail the properties of Kruglov and Harvey's soliton solution under loss, verifying earlier predictions of perturbation theory and suggesting a convergence to the soliton solution of the standard nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the limit of large propagation distances.</description>

      <title>Efficient point-based simulation of four-way coupled particles in turbulence at high number density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many natural and industrial applications, turbulent flows encompass some form of dispersed particles. Although this type of multiphase turbulent flow is omnipresent, its numerical modeling has proven to be a remarkably challenging problem. Models that fully resolve the particle phase are computationally very expensive, strongly limiting the number of particles that can be considered in practice. This warrants the need for efficient reduced order modeling of the complex system of particles in turbulence that can handle high number densities of particles. Here, we present an efficient method for point-based simulation of particles in turbulence that are four-way coupled. In contrast with traditional one-way coupled simulations, where only the effect of the fluid phase on the particle phase is modeled, this method additionally captures the back-reaction of the particle phase on the fluid phase, as well as the interactions between particles themselves. We focus on the most challenging case of very light particles or bubbles, which show strong clustering in the high-vorticity regions of the fluid. This strong clustering poses numerical difficulties which are systematically treated in our work. Our method is valid in the limit of small particles with respect to the Kolmogorov scales of the flow and is able to handle very large number densities of particles. This methods paves the way for comprehensive studies of the collective effect of small particles in fluid turbulence for a multitude of applications.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties within DPOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse\textcolor{red}{.} The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

      <title>TENG: Time-Evolving Natural Gradient for Solving PDEs with Deep Neural Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are instrumental for modeling dynamical systems in science and engineering. The advent of neural networks has initiated a significant shift in tackling these complexities though challenges in accuracy persist, especially for initial value problems. In this paper, we introduce the $\textit{Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG)}$, generalizing time-dependent variational principles and optimization-based time integration, leveraging natural gradient optimization to obtain high accuracy in neural-network-based PDE solutions. Our comprehensive development includes algorithms like TENG-Euler and its high-order variants, such as TENG-Heun, tailored for enhanced precision and efficiency. TENG's effectiveness is further validated through its performance, surpassing current leading methods and achieving machine precision in step-by-step optimizations across a spectrum of PDEs, including the heat equation, Allen-Cahn equation, and Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Applying Machine Learning Methods to Laser Acceleration of Protons: Lessons Learned from Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers in the field of ultra-intense laser science are beginning to embrace machine learning methods. In this study we consider three different machine learning methods -- a two-hidden layer neural network, Support Vector Regression and Gaussian Process Regression -- and compare how well they can learn from a synthetic data set for proton acceleration in the Target Normal Sheath Acceleration regime. The synthetic data set was generated from a previously published theoretical model by Fuchs et al. 2005 that we modified. Once trained, these machine learning methods can assist with efforts to maximize the peak proton energy, or with the more general problem of configuring the laser system to produce a proton energy spectrum with desired characteristics. In our study we focus on both the accuracy of the machine learning methods and the performance on one GPU including the memory consumption. Although it is arguably the least sophisticated machine learning model we considered, Support Vector Regression performed very well in our tests.</description>

      <title>More Quantum Chemistry with Fewer Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation is one of the most promising new paradigms for the simulation of physical systems composed of electrons and atomic nuclei, with applications in chemistry, solid-state physics, materials science, or molecular biology. This requires a truncated representation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian using a finite number of orbitals. While it is, in principle, obvious how to improve on the representation by including more orbitals, this is usually unfeasible in practice (e.g., because of the limited number of qubits available) and severely compromises the accuracy of the obtained results. Here, we propose a quantum algorithm that improves on the representation of the physical problem by virtue of second-order perturbation theory. In particular, our quantum algorithm evaluates the second-order energy correction through a series of time-evolution steps under the unperturbed Hamiltonian. An important application is to go beyond the active-space approximation, allowing to include corrections of virtual orbitals, known as multireference perturbation theory. Here, we exploit that the unperturbed Hamiltonian is diagonal for virtual orbitals and show that the number of qubits is independent of the number of virtual orbitals. This gives rise to more accurate energy estimates without increasing the number of qubits. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically for realistic chemical systems that the overall runtime of our method has highly favourable scaling in the number of virtual orbitals compared to previous work. The numerical calculations confirm the necessity of the multireference perturbation theory energy corrections to reach accurate ground state energy estimates. Our perturbation theory quantum algorithm can also be applied to Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory. As such, we reduce the quantum hardware requirements for quantum chemistry by leveraging perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>GPAW: An open Python package for electronic-structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the GPAW open-source Python package for electronic structure calculations. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves, and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an ideal platform for implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover, it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations from the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE), variational calculations of excited states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time propagation of the Kohn-Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much more. Recently, support of GPU acceleration has been achieved with minor modifications of the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review with an outlook describing some future plans for GPAW.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel solver for rarefied gas flow using GSIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS) has been proposed to find the steady-state solution of the Boltzmann equation in the whole range of gas rarefaction, where its fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties lead to the significant reduction of iteration numbers and spatial cells in the near-continuum flow regime. However, the efficiency and accuracy of GSIS has only been demonstrated in two-dimensional problems with small numbers of spatial cells and discrete velocities. Here, a large-scale parallel computing strategy is designed to extend the GSIS to three-dimensional flow problems, including the supersonic flows which are usually difficult to solve by the discrete velocity method. Since the GSIS involves the calculation of the mesoscopic kinetic equation which is defined in six-dimensional phase-space, and the macroscopic high-temperature Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations in three-dimensional physical space, the proper partition of the spatial and velocity spaces, and the allocation of CPU cores to the mesoscopic and macroscopic solvers, are the keys to improving the overall computational efficiency. These factors are systematically tested to achieve optimal performance, up to 100 billion spatial and velocity grids. For hypersonic flows around the Apollo reentry capsule, the X38-like vehicle, and the space station, our parallel solver can obtain the converged solution within one hour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extracting consistent statistics between relevant free-energy minima of a molecular system is essential for physics, chemistry and biology. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can aid in this task but are computationally expensive, especially for systems that require quantum accuracy. To overcome this challenge, we develop an approach combining enhanced sampling with deep generative models and active learning of a machine learning potential (MLP). We introduce an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that enables the training of one Normalizing Flow (NF) and one MLP per state, achieving rapid convergence towards the Boltzmann distribution. Leveraging the trained NF and MLP models, we compute thermodynamic observables such as free-energy differences or optical spectra. We apply this method to study the isomerization of an ultrasmall silver nanocluster, belonging to a set of systems with diverse applications in the fields of medicine and catalysis.</description>

Abstract: One of the current challenges in physically-based simulations, and, more specifically, fluid simulations, is to produce visually appealing results at interactive rates, capable of being used in multiple forms of media. In recent times, a lot of effort has been made with regards to this with the use of multi-core architectures, as many of the computations involved in the algorithms for these simulations are very well suited for these architectures. Although there is a considerable amount of works regarding acceleration techniques in this field, there is yet room to further explore and analyze some of them. To investigate this problem, we surveyed the topic of fluid simulations and some of the recent contributions towards this field. Additionally, we implemented two versions of a fluid simulation algorithm, one on the CPU and the other on the GPU using NVIDIA's CUDA framework, with the intent of gaining a better understanding of the effort needed to move these simulations to a multi-core architecture and the performance gains that we get with it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector wavefunctions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector wavefunctions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW pseudopotential inspired, basis set method for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO or lo (Localized orbitals) basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis for a hybrid basis for small molecules.</description>
