      <title>Key motifs searching in complex dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Key network motifs searching in complex networks is one of the crucial aspects of network analysis. There has been a series of insightful findings and valuable applications for various scenarios through the analysis of network structures. However, in dynamic systems, slight changes in the choice of dynamic equations and parameters can alter the significance of motifs. The known methods are insufficient to address this issue effectively. In this paper, we introduce a concept of perturbation energy based on the system's Jacobian matrix, and define motif centrality for dynamic systems by seamlessly integrating network topology with dynamic equations. Through simulations, we observe that the key motifs obtained by the proposed energy method present better effective and accurate than them by integrating network topology methods, without significantly increasing algorithm complexity. The finding of key motifs can be used to apply for system control, such as formulating containment policies for the spread of epidemics and protecting fragile ecosystems. Additionally, it makes substantial contribution to a deeper understanding of concepts in physics, such as signal propagation and system's stability.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Dynamics in a Galactic Multipolar Halo with a Compact Primary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational evidence strongly supports the existence of a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) at the Galactic center, surrounded by dense stellar clusters. Modeling galactic centers with intricate structures like shells and rings pose challenges, prompting the use of simplified models such as a spherical monopole potential with a multipolar halo mass distribution. This approach, employing a multipolar expansion model, provides versatility for numerical analyses, revealing the complex dynamics of stars in this region. Pseudo-Potentials like Paczynsky-Wiita and Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov are utilized to simulate the impacts of strong gravity from non-rotating and rotating compact objects respectively, elucidating their influence on stellar dynamics. Chaos naturally arises due to non-central forces, visualized using the Poincar\'e section technique. Of particular importance is the utilization of the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI), a powerful nonlinear dynamical tool, which categorizes particle orbits as escaping, regular, sticky, or chaotic. We exhaustively examine all combinations of multipolar moments up to the octupolar term along with spin using this tool, which had not been studied earlier. SALI provides a straightforward yet efficient method for assessing the interplay between the system's different multipolar moments, their combinations, and spin. Thus, our findings offer insights into the dynamics of compact objects enshrouded in a halo mass distribution and lay the groundwork for understanding complex astrophysical systems in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics and chaos in dissipative optical trimers with complex couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-Hermitian photonics, we consider a nonlinear optical trimer with three lossy waveguides with complex couplings. This non-Hermitian trimer exhibits stable stationary and oscillatory regimes in a wide range of values of the coupling-loss parameters. Moreover, chaotic dynamics through period-doubling is confirmed via Lyapunov exponent measurements and the underlying bifurcation structure is found by semi-analytical continuation of solutions. The interplay of chaos, due to Kerr nonlinearity, and non-Hermiticity, due to the combined dissipation and complex coupling, provides a different perspective in the area of nonlinear and non-Hermitian optics.</description>

      <title>Automatic classification of magnetic field lines by persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for the automatic classification of the orbits of magnetic field lines into topologically distinct classes using the Vietoris-Rips persistent homology is presented. The input to the method is the Poincare map orbits of field lines and the output is a separation into three classes: islands, chaotic layers, and invariant tori. The classification is tested numerically for the case of a toy model of a perturbed tokamak represented initially in its geometric coordinates. The persistent $H_1$ data is demonstrated to be sufficient to distinguish magnetic islands from the other orbits. When combined with persistent $H_0$ information, describing the average spacing between points on the Poincare section, the larger chaotic orbits can then be separated from very thin chaotic layers and invariant tori. It is then shown that if straight field line coordinates exist for a nearby integrable field configuration, the performance of the classification can be improved by transforming into this natural coordinate system. The focus is the application to toroidal magnetic confinement but the method is sufficiently general to apply to generic $1\frac{1}{2}$d Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Another comment on claims of a transition to the ultimate regime of heat transfer</title>

Abstract: Claims made by Zhu et al., PRL 120, 144502, (2018), that they had found evidence of a transition to the so called "ultimate regime" in 2D simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, have recently been repeated by Lohse &amp; Shishkina, Rev. Mod. Phys. 96, 03501 (2024). The author questions the validity of these claims.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>
