      <title>Stochastic Black Start Resource Allocation to Enable Dynamic Formation of Networked Microgrids and DER-aided Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended outages in distributed systems (DSs) dominated by distributed energy resources (DERs) require innovative strategies to efficiently and securely deploy black start (BS) resources. To address the need, this paper proposes a two-stage stochastic resource allocation method within synchronizing dynamic microgrids (MGs) for black start (SDMG-BS), enabling risk-averse and adaptive restoration across various scenarios while ensuring frequency security. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG)-controlled grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) equipped with primary frequency governors (PFGs) are modeled as BS resources. Their frequency response is characterized by three transient indices, which are deployed as frequency dynamic constraints on load pick-up events to ensure frequency stability during the BS process. SDMG-BS framework facilitates location-independent synchronization among restored MGs and with the transmission grid (TG) with the help of smart switches (SSWs). The model incorporates scenario-based stochastic programming to address multi-source uncertainties, including season-dependent operational conditions and unpredictable TG outage durations, ensuring a resilient allocation plan. The proposed approach is validated on a modified IEEE 123-node feeder with three study cases designed across sixteen uncertainty scenarios.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Sensing and Classification for Early Stress and Disease Detection in Avocado Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With rising demands for efficient disease and salinity management in agriculture, early detection of plant stressors is crucial, particularly for high-value crops like avocados. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of low-cost sensors deployed in the field for early stress and disease detection in avocado plants. Our monitoring system was deployed across 72 plants divided into four treatment categories within a greenhouse environment, with data collected over six months. While leaf temperature and conductivity measurements, widely used metrics for controlled settings, were found unreliable in field conditions due to environmental interference and positioning challenges, leaf spectral measurements produced statistically significant results when combined with our machine learning approach. For soil data analysis, we developed a two-level hierarchical classifier that leverages domain knowledge about treatment characteristics, achieving 75-86\% accuracy across different avocado genotypes and outperforming conventional machine learning approaches by over 20\%. In addition, performance evaluation on an embedded edge device demonstrated the viability of our approach for resource-constrained environments, with reasonable computational efficiency while maintaining high classification accuracy. Our work bridges the gap between theoretical potential and practical application of low-cost sensors in agriculture and offers insights for developing affordable, scalable monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>System-Level Performance and Communication Tradeoff in Networked Control with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed control of large-scale systems is challenging due to the need for scalable and localized communication and computation. In this work, we introduce a Predictive System-Level Synthesis PredSLS framework that designs controllers by jointly integrating communication constraints and local disturbance predictions into an affine feedback structure. Rather than focusing on the worst-case uncertainty, PredSLS leverages both current state feedback and future system disturbance predictions to achieve distributed control of networked systems. In particular, PredSLS enables a unified system synthesis of the optimal $\kappa$-localized controller, therefore outperforms approaches with post hoc communication truncation, as was commonly seen in the literature. The PredSLS framework can be naturally decomposed into spatial and temporal components for efficient and parallelizable computation across the network, yielding a regret upper bound that explicitly depends on the prediction error and communication range. Our regret analysis not only reveals a non-monotonic trade-off between control performance and communication range when prediction errors are present, but also guides the identification of an optimal size for local communication neighborhoods, thereby enabling the co-design of controller and its underlying communication topology.</description>

      <title>Power-Series Approach to Moment-Matching-Based Model Reduction of MIMO Polynomial Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model reduction problem for high-order multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) polynomial nonlinear systems based on moment matching is addressed. The technique of power-series decomposition is exploited: this decomposes the solution of the nonlinear PDE characterizing the center manifold into the solutions of a series of recursively defined Sylvester equations. This approach allows yielding nonlinear reduced-order models in very much the same way as in the linear case (e.g. analytically). Algorithms are proposed for obtaining the order and the parameters of the reduced-order models with precision of degree $\kappa$. The approach also provides new insights into the nonlinear moment matching problem: first, a lower bound for the order of the reduced-order model is obtained, which, in the MIMO case, can be strictly less than the number of matched moments; second, it is revealed that the lower bound is affected by the ratio of the number of the input and output channels; third, it is shown that under mild conditions, a nonlinear reduced-order model can always be constructed with either a linear state equation or a linear output equation.</description>

      <title>Scalable Sensor Placement for Cyclic Networks with Observability Guarantees: Application to Water Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal sensor placement is essential for state estimation and effective network monitoring. As known in the literature, this problem becomes particularly challenging in large-scale undirected or bidirected cyclic networks with parametric uncertainties, such as water distribution networks (WDNs), where pipe resistance and demand patterns are often unknown. Motivated by the challenges of cycles, parametric uncertainties, and scalability, this paper proposes a sensor placement algorithm that guarantees structural observability for cyclic and acyclic networks with parametric uncertainties. By leveraging a graph-based strategy, the proposed method efficiently addresses the computational complexities of large-scale networks. To demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, we apply it to several EPANET benchmark WDNs. Most notably, the developed algorithm solves the sensor placement problem with guaranteed structured observability for the L-town WDN with 1694 nodes and 124 cycles in under 0.1 seconds.</description>

      <title>Towards safe control parameter tuning in distributed multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many safety-critical real-world problems, such as autonomous driving and collaborative robots, are of a distributed multi-agent nature. To optimize the performance of these systems while ensuring safety, we can cast them as distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end, we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.</description>

      <title>Transient Stability Analysis for Grid Following Converters in Low-Inertia Power Systems by Direct Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increased penetration of renewable energy and reduced proportion of synchronous generators, the low-inertia characteristics of todays power system become prominent, and the transient stability issue of grid following converter (GFLC) under low inertia system (LIS) condition becomes critical. There are two prominent problems in the transient stability analysis of GFLC-LIS. The angular dynamic of LIS increases the complexity of transient stability analysis, and the nonlinear, possibly negative damping of GFLC makes it difficult to guarantee the conservative of the traditional methods. These problems make the traditional methods inapplicable. In this paper, the transient stability analysis of GFLC LIS is investigated to provide an accurate estimation of the attraction boundary and critical clearance time (CCT). Firstly, a dynamic model of GFLC-LIS is constructed, considering the phase-locked loop (PLL)-based GFLC dynamics and swing equation-based LIS dynamics. The frequency mutation of PLL at fault occurrence and clearing time is also considered. Secondly, a Zubov based transient stability analysis method is proposed, which can construct the energy function in a way that is different from the traditional conservation of energy perspective and can address the negative damping issue. Moreover, the accuracy of the CCT estimation is analyzed, and the influences of LIS parameters on transient stability are illustrated. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method</description>

      <title>Model-based Multi-object Visual Tracking: Identification and Standard Model Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.</description>

      <title>AutoMPC: A Code Generator for MPC-based Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful technique to control nonlinear, multi-input multi-output systems subject to input and state constraints. It is now a standard tool for trajectory tracking control of automated vehicles. As such it has been used in many research and development projects. However, MPC faces several challenges to be integrated into industrial production vehicles. The most important ones are its high computational demands and the complexity of implementation. The software packages AutoMPC aims to address both of these challenges. It builds on a robustified version of an active set algorithm for Nonlinear MPC. The algorithm is embedded into a framework for vehicle trajectory tracking, which makes it easy to used, yet highly customizable. Automatic code generation transforms the selections into a standalone, computationally efficient C-code file with static memory allocation. As such it can be readily deployed on a wide range of embedded platforms, e.g., based on Matlab/Simulink or Robot Operating System (ROS). Compared to a previous version of the code, the vehicle model and the numerical integration method can be manually specified, besides basic algorithm parameters. All of this information and all specifications are directly baked into the generated C-code. The algorithm is suitable driving scenarios at low or high speeds, even drifting, and supports direction changes. Multiple simulation scenarios show the versatility and effectiveness of the AutoMPC code, with the guarantee of a feasible solution, a high degree of robustness, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Singularity-free prescribed performance guaranteed control for perturbed system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the prescribed performance control (PPC) challenge for high-order nonlinear systems affected by mismatched disturbances. The research aims to prevent singularity issues arising from error boundary violations during abrupt changes in reference trajectories. We introduce a novel transformation function with infinite-order differentiability at connection points, advancing beyond mere continuous differentiability. Utilizing this transformation function, we develop a comprehensive transformation strategy that ensures: (1) errors remain within prescribed boundaries when reference trajectories are smooth, and (2) errors return to prescribed boundaries within a specified timeframe following abrupt changes in reference trajectories. Additionally, the complexity explosion issue inherent in backstepping design is effectively resolved. Simulation results corroborate the validity of the proposed theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>BioGAP-Ultra: A Modular Edge-AI Platform for Wearable Multimodal Biosignal Acquisition and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for continuous physiological monitoring and human-machine interaction in real-world settings calls for wearable platforms that are flexible, low-power, and capable of on-device intelligence. This work presents BioGAP-Ultra, an advanced multimodal biosensing platform that supports synchronized acquisition of diverse electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals such as EEG, EMG, ECG, and PPG while enabling embedded AI processing at state-of-the-art energy efficiency. BioGAP-Ultra is a major extension of our previous design, BioGAP [1], aimed at meeting the rapidly growing requirements of wearable biosensing applications. It features (i) increased on-device storage (x2 SRAM, x4 FLASH), (ii) improved wireless connectivity (1.4 Mbit/s bandwidth, x4 higher than BioGAP), (iii) enhanced number of signal modalities (from 3 to 5) and analog input channels (x2). Further, it is complemented by a complete real-time visualization and analysis software suite, providing access to raw data and real-time configurability on a mobile phone. Electrical characterization and multiple case studies confirm the platform's robustness, configurability, and suitability for real-world multimodal biosignal acquisition and edge intelligence. Finally, we demonstrate the system's versatility through integration into various wearable form factors: an EEG-PPG headband consuming 32.8 mW, an EMG sleeve at 26.7 mW, and an ECG-PPG chest band requiring only 9.3 mW, tailored for diverse biosignal applications. All hardware and software design files are also released open-source with a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Energy Management and Wake-up for IoT Networks Powered by Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) presents sustainability challenges such as increased maintenance requirements and overall higher energy consumption. This motivates self-sustainable IoT ecosystems based on Energy Harvesting (EH). This paper treats IoT deployments in which IoT devices (IoTDs) rely solely on EH to sense and transmit information about events/alarms to a base station (BS). The objective is to effectively manage the duty cycling of the IoTDs to prolong battery life and maximize the relevant data sent to the BS. The BS can also wake up specific IoTDs if extra information about an event is needed upon initial detection. We propose a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based duty cycling management to optimize energy efficiency and detection accuracy by considering spatial correlations among IoTDs' activity and their EH process. We evaluate machine learning approaches, including reinforcement learning (RL) and decision transformers (DT), to maximize information captured from events while managing energy consumption. Significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art approaches are obtained in terms of energy saving by all three proposals, KNN, RL, and DT. Moreover, the RL-based solution approaches the performance of a genie-aided benchmark as the number of IoTDs increases.</description>

      <title>LLMind 2.0: Distributed IoT Automation with Natural Language M2M Communication and Lightweight LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their application to IoT and automation systems, particularly for facilitating device management through natural language instructions. However, existing centralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing and coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities in large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a distributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges through lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled automation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate device-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0 distributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs embedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions into simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then processed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at the associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers by using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless collaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system incorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for reliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution framework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and real-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in scalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Model-Predictive Control of a Soft Continuum Robot Using a Physics-Informed Neural Network Based on Cosserat Rod Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Full Potential of RRAMs through Scalable and Distributed In-Memory Computing with Integrated Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential growth in global computing demand is exacerbated due to the higher-energy requirements of conventional architectures, primarily due to energy-intensive data movement. In-memory computing with Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) addresses this by co-integrating memory and processing, but faces significant hurdles related to device-level non-idealities and poor scalability for large computing tasks. Here, we introduce \textbf{MELISO+} (In-\textbf{Me}mory \textbf{Li}near \textbf{So}lver), a full-stack, distributed framework for energy-efficient in-memory computing. MELISO+ proposes a novel two-tier error correction mechanism to mitigate device non-idealities and develops a distributed RRAM computing framework to enable matrix computations exceeding dimensions of $65,000 \times 65,000$. This approach reduces first- and second-order arithmetic errors due to device non-idealities by over 90\%, enhances energy efficiency by three to five orders of magnitude, and decreases latency 100-fold. Hence, MELISO+ allows lower-precision RRAM devices to outperform high-precision device alternatives in accuracy, energy and latency metrics. By unifying algorithm-hardware co-design with scalable architecture, MELISO+ significantly advances sustainable, high-dimensional computing suitable for applications like large language models and generative AI.</description>

      <title>Observed Control -- Linearly Scalable Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Adaptive Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work highlights the duality between state estimation methods and model predictive control. A predictive controller, observed control, is presented that uses this duality to efficiently compute control actions with linear time-horizon length scalability. The proposed algorithms provide exceptional computational efficiency, adaptive time horizon lengths, and early optimization termination criteria. The use of Kalman smoothers as the backend optimization framework provides for a straightforward implementation supported by strong theoretical guarantees. Additionally, a formulation is presented that separates linear model predictive control into purely reactive and anticipatory components, enabling any-time any-horizon observed control while ensuring controller stability for short time horizons. Finally, numerical case studies confirm that nonlinear filter extensions, i.e., the extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter, effectively extend observed control to nonlinear systems and objectives.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control of AWOISV: A Filtered Tube-Based MPC Approach for Simultaneous Tracking of Lateral Position and Heading Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and \(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed, achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties. Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring excellent real-time performance.</description>

      <title>MuFlex: A Scalable, Physics-based Platform for Multi-Building Flexibility Analysis and Coordination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid, maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance. Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.</description>

      <title>Amplitude maximization in stable systems, Schur positivity, and some conjectures on polynomial interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $r &gt; 0$ and integers $t \ge n &gt; 0$, we consider the following ``amplitude maximization'' problem: maximize the quantity $|x_t|$ over the set of complex solutions $x = (x_0, x_1, \dots)$ of all homogeneous linear difference equations of order $n$ with the roots of characteristic polynomial in the disc $\{z \in \mathbb{C}: |z| \le r\}$, and with initial values $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ in the unit disc. We find that for any $t,n,r$, the maximum is attained in the case of coinciding roots on the boundary circle; this implies that for all $r &lt; 1$, the maximum amplitude can be computed explicitly, by studying a single equation whose characteristic polynomial is $(z-r)^n$. Moreover, the optimality of the co-phase root configuration holds for origin-centered polydiscs. To prove this result, we first reduce the problem to a certain interpolation problem over monomials, then solve the latter by leveraging the theory of symmetric functions and identifying the associated Schur positivity structure. We also discuss the implications for more general Reinhardt domains. Finally, we study the problem of estimating the derivatives of a real entire function from its values at $n/2$ pairs of complex conjugate points in the unit disc. Here, we propose conjectures on the extremality of the monomial $z^n$, and restate them in terms of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Repeater Swarm-Assisted Cellular Systems: Interaction Stability and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cellular massive MIMO system where swarms of wireless repeaters are deployed to improve coverage. These repeaters are full-duplex relays with small form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They can be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent to the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with amplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in repeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive feedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and amplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be achieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more interference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist stability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check stability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an efficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user transmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum rate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the system performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands. The results also warrant careful deployment to fully realize the benefits of repeaters, for example, by ensuring a high probability of line-of-sight links between repeaters and the base station.</description>

Abstract: This letter proposes a method to integrate auxiliary actuators that enhance the task space capabilities of commercial underactuated systems, leaving the internal certified low level controller untouched. The additional actuators are combined with a feedback linearizing outer loop controller, enabling full pose tracking. We provide the conditions under which legacy high level commands and new actuator inputs can be cohesively coordinated to achieve decoupled control of all degrees of freedom. A comparative study with a standard quadrotor originally not designed for physical interaction demonstrates that the proposed modified platform remains stable under contact, while the baseline system diverges. Additionally, simulation results under parameter uncertainty illustrate the robustness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Exposing Barriers to Flexibility Aggregation in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DER) offers new opportunities for distribution system operators (DSO) to improve network operation through flexibility services. To utilise flexible resources, various DER flexibility aggregation methods have been proposed, such as the concept of aggregated P-Q flexibility areas. Yet, many existing studies assume perfect coordination among DER and rely on single-phase power flow analysis, thus overlooking barriers to flexibility aggregation in real unbalanced systems. To quantify the impact of these barriers, this paper proposes a three-phase optimal power flow (OPF) framework for P-Q flexibility assessment, implemented as an open-source Julia tool 3FlexAnalyser.jl. The framework explicitly accounts for voltage unbalance and imperfect coordination among DER in low voltage (LV) distribution networks. Simulations on an illustrative 5-bus system and a real 221-bus LV network in the UK reveal that over 30% of the theoretical aggregated flexibility potential can be lost due to phase unbalance and lack of coordination across phases. These findings highlight the need for improved flexibility aggregation tools applicable to real unbalanced distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting structural observability and graph colorability for optimal sensor placement in water distribution networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water distribution networks (WDNs) are critical systems for our society and detecting leakages is important for minimizing losses and water waste. This makes optimal sensor placement for leakage detection very relevant. Existing sensor placement methods rely on simulation-based scenarios, often lacking structure and generalizability, or depend on the knowledge of specific parameters of the WDN as well as on initial sensor data for linearization and demand estimation. Motivated by this, this paper investigates the observability of an entire WDN, based on structural observability theory. This allows us to establish the conditions for the observability of the WDN model, independently of parameter uncertainties. Additionally, a sensor placement algorithm is proposed that leverages such observability conditions and graph theory and accounts for the industrial and material costs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to a hydraulic-transient WDN model.</description>

      <title>Achieving Dispatchability in Data Centers: Carbon and Cost-Aware Sizing of Energy Storage and Local Photovoltaic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data centers are large electricity consumers due to the high consumption needs of servers and their cooling systems. Given the current crypto-currency and artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound to grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower the carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by international agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in power distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the power system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which leads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation. This work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy Storage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its carbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed scenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system to minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon footprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the resources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power distribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of the data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different Swiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware sizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the local electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance conditions. Some regions show potential in carbon footprint reduction, while other regions do not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16331v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ho-Kalman algorithm has been widely employed for the identification of discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. In this paper, we investigate the pole estimation error for the Ho-Kalman algorithm based on finite input/output sample data. Building upon prior works, we derive finite sample error bounds for system pole estimation in both single-trajectory and multiple-trajectory scenarios. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability, the estimation error for an $n$-dimensional system decreases at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2n})$ in the single-trajectory setting with trajectory length $T$, and at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2n})$ in the multiple-trajectory setting with $N$ independent trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that in both settings, achieving a constant estimation error requires a super-polynomial sample size in $ \max\{n/m, n/p\} $, where $n/m$ and $n/p$ denote the state-to-output and state-to-input dimension ratios, respectively. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results of system pole estimation.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for robust dynamic metabolic control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic metabolic control allows key metabolic fluxes to be modulated in real time, enhancing bioprocess flexibility and expanding available optimization degrees of freedom. This is achieved, e.g., via targeted modulation of metabolic enzyme expression. However, identifying optimal dynamic control policies is challenging due to the generally high-dimensional solution space and the need to manage metabolic burden and cytotoxic effects arising from inducible enzyme expression. The task is further complicated by stochastic dynamics, which reduce bioprocess reproducibility. We propose a reinforcement learning framework} to derive optimal policies by allowing an agent (the controller) to interact with a surrogate dynamic model. To promote robustness, we apply domain randomization, enabling the controller to generalize across uncertainties. When transferred to an experimental system, the agent can in principle continue fine-tuning the policy. Our framework provides an alternative to conventional model-based control such as model predictive control, which requires model differentiation with respect to decision variables; often impractical for complex stochastic, nonlinear, stiff, and piecewise-defined dynamics. In contrast, our approach relies on forward integration of the model, thereby simplifying the task. We demonstrate the framework in two $\textit{Escherichia coli}$ bioprocesses: dynamic control of acetyl-CoA carboxylase for fatty-acid synthesis and of adenosine triphosphatase for lactate synthesis.</description>

      <title>Rapid Urban Visibility Hotspots: Quantifying Building Vertex Visibility from Connected Vehicle Trajectories using Spatial Indexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective placement of Out-of-Home advertising and street furniture requires accurate identification of locations offering maximum visual exposure to target audiences, particularly vehicular traffic. Traditional site selection methods often rely on static traffic counts or subjective assessments. This research introduces a data-driven methodology to objectively quantify location visibility by analyzing large-scale connected vehicle trajectory data (sourced from Compass IoT) within urban environments. We model the dynamic driver field-of-view using a forward-projected visibility area for each vehicle position derived from interpolated trajectories. By integrating this with building vertex locations extracted from OpenStreetMap, we quantify the cumulative visual exposure, or ``visibility count'', for thousands of potential points of interest near roadways. The analysis reveals that visibility is highly concentrated, identifying specific ``visual hotspots'' that receive disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. The core technical contribution involves the construction of a BallTree spatial index over building vertices. This enables highly efficient (O(logN) complexity) radius queries to determine which vertices fall within the viewing circles of millions of trajectory points across numerous trips, significantly outperforming brute-force geometric checks. Analysis reveals two key findings: 1) Visibility is highly concentrated, identifying distinct 'visual hotspots' receiving disproportionately high exposure compared to average locations. 2) The aggregated visibility counts across vertices conform to a Log-Normal distribution.</description>

However, their data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit their ability to handle scenarios that require long-term temporal dependencies or few-shot and zero-shot decision making. Emerging Decision Transformers (DTs), which leverage causal transformers for sequence modeling in DRL tasks, offer a promising alternative. However, their reliance on return-to-go (RTG) cloning and limited generalization capacity restricts their effectiveness in dynamic power system environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Dual-Head Physics-informed Graph Decision Transformer (DH-PGDT) that integrates physical modeling, structural reasoning, and subgoal-based guidance to enable scalable and robust DSR even in zero-shot or few-shot scenarios. DH-PGDT features a dual-head physics-informed causal transformer architecture comprising Guidance Head, which generates subgoal representations, and Action Head, which uses these subgoals to generate actions independently of RTG. It also incorporates an operational constraint-aware graph reasoning module that encodes power system topology and operational constraints to generate a confidence-weighted action vector for refining DT trajectories. This design effectively improves generalization and enables robust adaptation to unseen scenarios. While this work focuses on DSR, the underlying computing model of the proposed PGDT is broadly applicable to sequential decision making across various power system operations and other complex engineering domains.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Surrogate Model for Efficient Multi-Task Parameter Learning in Closed-Loop Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.</description>

      <title>Framework for Modeling and Optimization of On-Orbit Servicing Operations under Demand Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework that models and optimizes the operations of complex on-orbit servicing infrastructures involving one or more servicers and orbital depots to provide multiple types of services to a fleet of geostationary satellites. The proposed method extends the state-of-the-art space logistics technique by addressing the unique challenges in on-orbit servicing applications, and integrate it with the Rolling Horizon decision making approach. The space logistics technique enables modeling of the on-orbit servicing logistical operations as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program whose optimal solutions can efficiently be found. The Rolling Horizon approach enables the assessment of the long-term value of an on-orbit servicing infrastructure by accounting for the uncertain service needs that arise over time among the geostationary satellites. Two case studies successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework for (1) short-term operational scheduling and (2) long-term strategic decision making for on-orbit servicing architectures under diverse market conditions.</description>

      <title>On-Orbit Servicing Optimization Framework with High- and Low-Thrust Propulsion Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an on-orbit servicing logistics optimization framework that is capable of performing the short-term operational scheduling and long-term strategic planning of sustainable servicing infrastructures that involve high-thrust, low-thrust, and/or multimodal servicers supported by orbital depots. The proposed framework generalizes the state-of-the-art on-orbit servicing logistics optimization method by incorporating user-defined trajectory models and optimizing the logistics operations with the propulsion technology and trajectory tradeoff in consideration. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming is leveraged to find the optimal operations of the servicers over a given period, while the Rolling Horizon approach is used to consider a long time horizon accounting for the uncertainties in service demand. Several analyses are carried out to demonstrate the value of the proposed framework in automatically trading off the high- and low-thrust propulsion systems for both short-term operational scheduling and long-term strategic planning of on-orbit servicing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>DDD-GenDT: Dynamic Data-driven Generative Digital Twin Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology enables real-time simulation, prediction, and optimization of physical systems, but practical deployment faces challenges from high data requirements, proprietary data constraints, and limited adaptability to evolving conditions. This work introduces DDD-GenDT, a dynamic data-driven generative digital twin framework grounded in the Dynamic Data-Driven Application Systems (DDDAS) paradigm. The architecture comprises the Physical Twin Observation Graph (PTOG) to represent operational states, an Observation Window Extraction process to capture temporal sequences, a Data Preprocessing Pipeline for sensor structuring and filtering, and an LLM ensemble for zero-shot predictive inference. By leveraging generative AI, DDD-GenDT reduces reliance on extensive historical datasets, enabling DT construction in data-scarce settings while maintaining industrial data privacy. The DDDAS feedback mechanism allows the DT to autonomically adapt predictions to physical twin (PT) wear and degradation, supporting DT-aging, which ensures progressive synchronization of DT with PT evolution. The framework is validated using the NASA CNC milling dataset, with spindle current as the monitored variable. In a zero-shot setting, the GPT-4-based DT achieves an average RMSE of 0.479 A (4.79% of the 10 A spindle current), accurately modeling nonlinear process dynamics and PT aging without retraining. These results show that DDD-GenDT provides a generalizable, data-efficient, and adaptive DT modeling approach, bridging generative AI with the performance and reliability requirements of industrial DT applications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Lattice-based Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems, represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and operating within a cluttered environment.</description>
