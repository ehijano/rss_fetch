      <title>Supervaluation-Style Truth Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervaluational fixed-point semantics for truth cannot be axiomatized because of its recursion-theoretic complexity. Johannes Stern (\emph{Supervaluation-Style Truth Without Supervaluations}, Journal of Philosophical Logic, 2018) proposed a new strategy (supervaluational-style truth) to capture the essential aspects of the supervaluational evaluation schema whilst limiting its recursion-theoretic complexity, hence resulting in ($\nat$-categorical) axiomatizations. Unfortunately, as we show in the paper, this strategy was not fully realized in Stern's original work: in fact, we provide counterexamples to some of Stern's key claims. However, we also vindicate Stern's project by providing different semantic incarnations of the idea and corresponding $\nat$-categorical axiomatizations. The results provide a deeper picture of the relationships between standard supervaluationism and supervaluational-style truth.</description>

      <title>Definable sets in Skolem arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present a characterization of sets definable in Skolem arithmetic, i.e., the first-order theory of natural numbers with multiplication. This characterization allows us to prove the decidability of the theory. The idea is similar to that of Mostowski; however, our characterization is new, and the proof relies on different combinatorial tools. The main goal of this note is to provide a simpler decidability proof than those previously known.</description>

      <title>Continuous approximate roots of polynomial equations via shape theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuous approximate solutions to polynomial equations over the ring $C(X)$ of continuous complex-valued functions over a compact Hausdorff space $X$. We show that when $X$ is one-dimensional, the existence of such approximate solutions is governed by the behaviour of maps from the fundamental pro-group of $X$ into braid groups.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>

      <title>Hyper swap structures and Kalman functors: the case study of da Costa logic $C_\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we recast Morgado hyperlattices and Sette implicative hyperlattices in lattice-theoretic terms. By utilizing swap structures induced by implicative lattices, we obtained a direct proof of soundness and completeness for da Costa's paraconsistent logic $C_\omega$ with respect to Sette's hyperalgebraic semantics. Inspired by Kalman functors in the context of twist structures, we introduce the notion of hyper swap structures, a novel class of hyperalgebras that naturally generalize swap structure semantics. We prove that these hyperalgebras, besides providing another class of hyperalgebraic models for $C_\omega$, induce a Kalman-style functor between the category of Sette implicative hyperlattices and the category of enriched hyperalgebras for $C_\omega$. Specifically, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between Sette implicative hyperlattices and their enriched hyperalgebraic counterparts using Kalman and forgetful functors. Similar results are extended to two axiomatic extensions of $C_\omega$.</description>

      <title>Cofinal families of finite VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given infinite cardinals $\theta\leq \kappa$, we ask for the minimal VC-dimension of a cofinal family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq[\kappa]^{&lt;\theta}$. We show that for $\theta=\omega$ and $\kappa=\aleph_n$ it is consistent with ZFC that there exists such a family of VC-dimension $n+1$, which is known to be the lower bound. For $\theta&gt;\omega$ we answer this question completely, demonstrating a strong dichotomy between the case of singular and regular $\theta$. We furthermore answer some relative and generalized versions of the above question for singular $\theta$, and answer a related question which appears in \cite{BBNKS}.</description>
