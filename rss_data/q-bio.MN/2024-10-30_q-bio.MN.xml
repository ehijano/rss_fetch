      <title>TRENDY: Gene Regulatory Network Inference Enhanced by Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a crucial role in the control of cellular functions. Numerous methods have been developed to infer GRNs from gene expression data, including mechanism-based approaches, information-based approaches, and more recent deep learning techniques, the last of which often overlooks the underlying gene expression mechanisms. In this work, we introduce TRENDY, a novel GRN inference method that integrates transformer models to enhance the mechanism-based WENDY approach. Through testing on both simulated and experimental datasets, TRENDY demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we apply this transformer-based approach to three additional inference methods, showcasing its broad potential to enhance GRN inference.</description>

      <title>NetAurHPD: Network Auralization Hyperlink Prediction Model to Identify Metabolic Pathways from Metabolomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metabolite biosynthesis is regulated via metabolic pathways, which can be activated and deactivated within organisms. Understanding and identifying an organism's metabolic pathway network is a crucial aspect for various research fields, including crop and life stock breeding, pharmacology, and medicine. The problem of identifying whether a pathway is part of a studied metabolic system is commonly framed as a hyperlink prediction problem. The most important challenge in prediction of metabolic pathways is the sparsity of the labeled data. This challenge can partially be mitigated using metabolite correlation networks which are affected by all active pathways including those that were not confirmed yet in laboratory experiments. Unfortunately, extracting properties that can confirm or refute existence of a metabolic pathway in a particular organism is not a trivial task. In this research, we introduce the Network Auralization Hyperlink Prediction (NetAurHPD) which is a framework that relies on (1) graph auralization to extract and aggregate representations of nodes in metabolite correlation networks and (2) data augmentation method that generates metabolite correlation networks given a subset of chemical reactions defined as hyperlinks. Experiments with metabolites correlation-based networks of tomato pericarp demonstrate promising results for NetAurHPD, compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, the application of data augmentation improved NetAurHPD's learning capabilities and overall performance. Additionally, NetAurHPD outperformed state-of-the-art method in experiments under challenging conditions, and has the potential to be a valuable tool for exploring organisms with limited existing knowledge.</description>

      <title>Competition for binding targets results in paradoxical effects for simultaneous activator and repressor action -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of epigenetic transformations in cancer metastasis, a puzzling effect was recently discovered, in which the elimination (knock-out) of an activating regulatory element leads to increased (rather than decreased) activity of the element being regulated. It has been postulated that this paradoxical behavior can be explained by activating and repressing transcription factors competing for binding to other possible targets. It is very difficult to prove this hypothesis in mammalian cells, due to the large number of potential players and the complexity of endogenous intracellular regulatory networks. Instead, this paper analyzes this issue through an analogous synthetic biology construct which aims to reproduce the paradoxical behavior using standard bacterial gene expression networks. The paper first reviews the motivating cancer biology work, and then describes a proposed synthetic construct. A mathematical model is formulated, and basic properties of uniqueness of steady states and convergence to equilibria are established, as well as an identification of parameter regimes which should lead to observing such paradoxical phenomena (more activator leads to less activity at steady state). A proof is also given to show that this is a steady-state property, and for initial transients the phenomenon will not be observed. This work adds to the general line of work of resource competition in synthetic circuits.</description>
