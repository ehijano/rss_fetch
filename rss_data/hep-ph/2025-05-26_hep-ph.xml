      <title>Lepton flavor violation by three units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conservation of lepton flavor is a prediction of the Standard Model and is still an excellent approximate symmetry despite our observation of neutrino oscillations. Lepton flavor violation by one or two units have been discussed for decades, with several dedicated experiments exploring the vast model landscape but no discoveries so far. Here, we explore operators and processes that violate at least one lepton flavor by three units and identify testable signatures. In the Standard Model effective field theory, such operators already arise at mass dimension 7 and can be tested through their contributions to Michel parameters in leptonic decays. True neutrinoless charged-lepton flavor violation arises at mass dimension 10 and can realistically only be seen in the tau decay channels $\tau \to eee\bar{\mu}\bar{\mu}$ or $\tau \to \mu\mu\mu\bar{e}\bar{e}$, for example in Belle II. Testable rates for these tau decays require light new particles and subsequently predict an avalanche of remarkably clean but so-far unconstrained collider signatures.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter in a $U(1)_X$ extended 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of having a vector boson dark matter in a $U(1)_X$ extended two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) setup. The gauge boson gains mass when a SM singlet complex scalar, which is charged under the dark $U(1)_X$ symmetry, acquires vacuum expectation value (\textit{vev}). This scalar acts as the connection between the SM sector and DM via the Higgs portal. An additional exact charge conjugation symmetry inhibits the mixing of this gauge boson with the photon, thereby confirming the stability of DM. On the other hand, 2HDM with Type I $Z_2$ restriction can offer a non-standard Higgs in the lighter mass range. This freedom allows us to accommodate dark matter mass in the (40-60) GeV regime where the direct detection constraints are strongest. We study the dark matter phenomenology of such a model while taking care of all possible theoretical and experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Examining dark neutron decay using f-mode gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the impact of neutron decay into dark matter and various dark matter self-interaction strengths on neutron star properties have been explored. Using the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model for nucleon-only equations of state (EoSs), the effects of different matter compositions have been compared, including strange matter and self-interacting dark matter. The results demonstrate that increasing DM-DM self-repulsion stiffens the EoS, influencing the mass-radius relationship and stability of neutron stars. Furthermore, fundamental mode (f-mode) oscillations have been analyzed, which serve as a diagnostic tool for probing neutron star interiors. Both first- and second-order f-mode frequencies follow universal relations, reinforcing their applicability for constraining dense matter properties. It has been shown that neutron stars composed of nucleons-only and self-interacting dark matter exhibit a universal behavior in damping time and angular frequency, whereas strange matter and non-self-interacting dark matter deviate from this trend. These findings highlight the significance of gravitational wave detections in investigating neutron star structure, particularly with next-generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. This study provides a pathway for testing dark matter models through gravitational wave asteroseismology, bridging astrophysical observations and fundamental particle physics.</description>

      <title>Relative difference between up and down quark structure of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presen a novel determination of the down-to-up composition ratio using the forward-backward asymmetry observed in the proton-proton collisions at the LHC. This method offers unique insights into the flavor-specific difference between down and up quarks, which are difficult to isolate in traditional cross-section measurements due to the inherent mixing of contributions from both flavors. In this study, we systematically measure the down-to-up quark ratio over a broad momentum fraction (x) range of 0.01 to 0.1, utilizing the sensitivity of the forward-backward asymmetry to quark-level couplings. Our findings reveal significant deviations in both the value and x-dependence of this ratio compared to predictions from current parton distribution functions (PDFs). These discrepancies highlight potential limitations in existing PDF parameterization and emphasize the importance of flavor-separated measurements for advancing our understanding of proton structure.</description>

      <title>Compositness and wave function of shallow bound states in relation with scattering observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the internal structure of exotic hadrons, especially focusing on the relation between the compositeness and physical observables. Defined as the probability of finding hadronic molecular components in the wave function, compositeness serves as a quantitative measure of internal structure of exotic hadrons. We utilize the coupled-channel potential model incorporating both quark and hadron degrees of freedom, which naturally generate the $\textit{bare state}$ responsible for the elementary component as the bound state in the quark channel. The behavior of the compositeness under the variation of the model parameters is investigated by using the $X(3872)$ as an example. In particular, we analyze the associated scattering phase shifts and the bound state wave functions to discuss the relation between the compositeness and the scattering observables for a shallow bound state.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Physics at Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a brief review of the collider phenomenology of neutrino physics. Current and future colliders provide an ideal testing ground for (sub)TeV-scale neutrino mass models, as they can directly probe the messenger particles, which could be either new fermions, scalars, or gauge bosons, associated with neutrino mass generation. Moreover, the recent observation of TeV-scale neutrinos produced at the LHC offers new ways to test the limits of the Standard Model and beyond.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay rates and the $3 + 2$ scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possible Majorana nature of neutrinos leads to lepton-number-violating effects such as neutrinoless double beta decay. The standard study of this process involves mass-dependent matrix elements which, although easy to use, might be missing important effects, especially in the light neutrino regime where the ultrasoft contributions become important. A fresh look at the different momentum regions leads us to an effective practical parametrisation for the decay amplitude that can show significant differences in the light-to-medium mass range of neutrinos compared to the standard parametrisation. As a concrete realisation of a UV model leading to Majorana neutrinos, the testability of a $3 + 2$ model with two sterile neutrinos is discussed.</description>

      <title>Invariant relativistic kinematics: Phase space triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of particle decay widths and scattering cross sections naturally decomposes into a quantum mechanical amplitude and a relativistic phase space (PS). This PS can be formulated in terms of parallelotopes providing frame independent invariants. We demonstrate how these invariants are related to frame dependent observables such as momenta, energies, and angles between particles. Furthermore, we derive expressions for n-dimensional PSs featuring simple integration limits that are particularly well suited for an analytical treatment. To that end we develop a pictorial description using PS diagrams that allow to straightforwardly identify the optimal set of integration variables for arbitrary n.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter EFT Landscape Probed by QUEST-DMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the projected sensitivity to non-relativistic effective field theory (EFT) operators for dark matter (DM) direct detection using the QUEST-DMC experiment. QUEST-DMC employs superfluid Helium-3 as a target medium and measures energy deposition via nanomechanical resonators with SQUID-based readout to probe DM interactions. The experiment aims to explore new parameter space in the sub-GeV mass range, probing light DM and a broad range of interaction models. We analyse the sensitivity to a complete set of fourteen independent non-relativistic EFT operators, each parameterised by a Wilson coefficient that quantifies the strength of DM interactions with Standard Model particles. For each interaction channel, we determine the corresponding sensitivity ceiling due to attenuation of the DM flux incident on the detector, caused by DM scattering in the Earth and atmosphere. As a key component of this analysis, we provide the mapping between the non-relativistic EFT operators and the relativistic bilinear DM-nucleon interactions, and assess the interaction sensitivity to sub-GeV DM in the QUEST-DMC detector. Our findings demonstrate that QUEST-DMC provides a unique probe of DM interactions, particularly in previously unexplored parameter space for momentum- and velocity-dependent interactions, thereby expanding the search for viable DM candidates beyond traditional weakly interacting massive particles.</description>

      <title>Towards factorization of jet observables in dense media : An EFT approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets are extended multipartonic systems and serve as a powerful tool for investigating the dynamics of emergent phenomena driven by many body QCD interactions. In heavy ion collisions, starting from their production during the perturbative hard scattering event in the initial stages of the collision to non-perturbative hadronization they interact with the various stages of quark-gluon plasma and retain imprints of fundamental properties of the medium. In these collisions, the jet production cross-section can be factorized using open quantum system framework along with effective field theory into various functions, each capturing a specific dynamics and depending on a single characteristic scale. In this review article, we discuss recent theoretical developments on factorization for jets in heavy-ion collisions with a specific example of jet substructure observable as energy-energy correlator and its generalization to projected $\nu$-point energy correlators.</description>

      <title>High-energy factorization via eigenfunctions of the next-to-leading-order BFKL kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formula for the amplitude of forward exclusive hadronic processes in the semihard regime of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), by means of the {\em next-to-leading order} eigenfunctions of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) kernel, as constructed by Chirilli and Kovchegov. We discuss some formal subtleties in the check of compatibility with the similar formula based on the use of the {\em leading-order} BFKL eigenfunctions. Finally, in the specific case of the electroproduction of two light vector mesons, we consider the numerical stability of the amplitude when one or the other set of eigenfunctions is adopted.</description>

      <title>Single-valued representation of unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering at next-to-next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the recently published analytic results for unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. These expressions for the hard scattering coefficients contain case distinctions in the kinematic $(x,z)$ plane splitting the analytic result in four regions. By re-expressing the coefficient functions in terms of single-valued polylogarithms we remove these case distinctions and can present a unified result valid in the entire kinematic range of SIDIS. This reduces the length of the overall expressions by 30% to 60%.</description>

      <title>On the global Gaussian bending measure and its applications in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02195v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been suggested to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there lacks effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it can be applied to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory is applicable to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameter $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18) and other LSS observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is preferred by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that some standard models of magnetic charge, the Banderet potential, the Dirac string potential, and the Wu-Yang fiber bundle approach, carry an electromagnetic field momentum in the presence of an electrostatic field. This electromagnetic field momentum suggests a violation of the center-of-energy theorem. We show that each of these monopole models also carry a hidden mechanical momentum, which saves the center-of-energy theorem.</description>

      <title>Surface Gauge Invariance, Soft Limits and the Transmutation of Gluons into Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past year, the "scalar-scaffolding" formalism has revealed a number of new features of gluon amplitudes. In this paper, we leverage these developments to study two distinct but related questions, linked by the scaffolding statement of gauge invariance. We start by revisiting the soft expansion of gluon amplitudes. The scaffolding picture allows for a precise definition of the soft limit and a canonical way to expand the amplitude. At tree-level, this reproduces the classic Weinberg soft theorem, and at one-loop, using surface kinematics, we derive an extension of this theorem valid at the level of the loop integrand. We then switch gears and describe a new relationship between gluon and scalar amplitudes. The expression of surface gauge invariance naturally suggests a certain differential operator acting on individual external gluons. Remarkably, we find that, both for the tree-level amplitude and the surface one-loop integrand, repeated applications of this operator transmutes gluon amplitudes/integrands into those of Tr$(\phi^3)$ scalars. This is an interesting counterpart to the $\delta$-shift connection that lifts "stringy" Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes to those of gluons.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Dark Energy Measurements from DESI DR2 and Planck 2015 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements and Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, we have measured the dark energy density $\rho_X(z)$ and dark energy equation of state $w_X(z)$ as free functions of redshift (smoothly interpolated from values at $z=0, 1/3, 2/3, 1, 4/3, 2.33$), and find both to be consistent with a cosmological constant, with only deviations of 1.2$\sigma$ for $\rho_X(z)$ and 1.9$\sigma$ for $w_X(z)$ at $z=2/3$. We confirm our earlier finding in Wang &amp; Freese (2006) that $w_X(z)$ is significantly less constrained by data than $\rho_X(z)$.
  Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, a finding which is the consequence of their assuming the parametrization $w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a)$. Our results indicate that assuming a linear $w_X(z)$ could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. We have demonstrated that it is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on the Formation of Biogenic Elements in Early Universe Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from strong first order phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational wave production at strong first order phase transitions, with large-scale, long-running simulations of a system with a scalar order parameter and a relativistic fluid. One transition proceeds by detonations with asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.92$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.67$, and the other by deflagrations, with a nominal asymptotic wall speed $v_\text{w}=0.44$ and transition strength $\alpha_n=0.5$. We investigate in detail the power spectra of velocity and shear stress and - for the first time in a phase transition simulation - their time decorrelation, which is essential for the understanding of gravitational wave production. In the detonation, the decorrelation speed is larger than the sound speed over a wide range of wavenumbers in the inertial range, supporting a visual impression of a flow dominated by supersonic shocks. Vortical modes do not contribute greatly to the produced gravitational wave power spectra even in the deflagration, where they dominate over a range of wavenumbers. In both cases, we observe dissipation of kinetic energy by acoustic turbulence, and in the case of the detonation an accompanying growth in the integral scale of the flow. The gravitational wave power approaches a constant with a power law in time, from which can be derived a gravitational wave production efficiency. For both cases this is approximately $\tilde{\Omega}^\infty_\text{gw} \simeq 0.017$, even though they have quite different kinetic energy densities. The corresponding fractional density in gravitational radiation today, normalised by the square of the mean bubble spacing in Hubble units, for flows which decay in much less than a Hubble time, is $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(4.8\pm1.1)\times 10^{-8}$ for the detonation, and $\Omega_{\text{gw},0}/(H_\text{n} R_*)^2=(1.3\pm0.2)\times 10^{-8}$ for the deflagration.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories can be solved exactly slightly away from the supersymmetric (SUSY) limit softly broken by anomaly mediation when the size of SUSY breaking is much smaller than the dynamical scale ($m \ll \Lambda$). We show empirical evidence that the near-SUSY limit is continuously connected to the non-SUSY limit ($m \gg \Lambda$) in $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_f$ quarks in the fundamental representation. The evidence includes the behavior of quark bi-linear condensate and gluon condensates, light hadron spectra, and consistency with the large $N_c$ limit. In addition, we present new predictions when $N_f/N_c \gtrsim O(1)$.</description>

Abstract: The neutrino research program in the coming decades will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for charge-current quasi-elastic scattering, on the combination of ``nucleon physics", expressed by form factors, and ``nuclear physics", expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. We present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas Model for electron-nucleus and charge-current quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Search for charged Higgs bosons through vector-like top quark pair production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery prospects for a vector-like top partner (VLT) in the Type-II Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-II) extended by a vector-like quark doublet ($TB$) at the 14~TeV LHC. The study focuses on the pair production process $pp \to T\bar{T} \to bH^+\, \bar{b}H^- \to b(tb)\, \bar{b}(\bar{t}b)$, yielding fully hadronic final states characterized by high $b$-jet multiplicity. Two analysis strategies are employed, requiring at least four or five $b$-tagged jets (4$b$ and 5$b$), to exploit the signal topology. Assuming a charged Higgs mass of $m_{H^\pm} \sim 600$~GeV and a systematic uncertainty of $\delta = 5\%$, the 4$b$ channel enables discovery up to $m_T \sim 1200$~GeV at $\mathcal{L} = 300~\text{fb}^{-1}$, while the 5$b$ analysis extends the reach to $m_T \sim 1300$~GeV. At higher luminosities of 1000--3000~fb$^{-1}$, the 5$b$ strategy achieves discovery sensitivity up to $m_T \sim 1400$~GeV. The reach is significantly reduced as $m_{H^\pm}$ increases, due to the suppression of the $\text{BR}(T \to H^+ b)$: for $m_{H^\pm} \sim 1000$~GeV, discovery becomes unattainable across all luminosity and systematic uncertainty configurations. Sensitivity is also strongly impacted by systematic uncertainties: for $\delta = 10\%$ and $m_{H^\pm} &lt; 1000$~GeV, discovery remains viable up to $m_T \sim 1200$~GeV in the 5$b$ analysis, while for $\delta = 20\%$, no discovery is achievable for $m_T \geq 1000$~GeV.</description>

      <title>Implications of electromagnetic scale anomaly to QCD chiral phase transition in smaller quark mass regime: $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ does not drop with eB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decrease of the chiral pseudocritical temperature $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ with an applied strong magnetic field has been extensively investigated by various QCD low-energy effective models and lattice QCD at physical point. We find that this decreasing feature may not hold in the case with a weak magnetic field and still depends on quark masses: when the quark masses get smaller, $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ turns to increase with the weak magnetic field. This happens due to the significant electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution in the thermomagnetic medium. We demonstrate this salient feature by employing the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with 2 + 1 quark flavors including the electromagnetic-scale anomaly contribution. We observe that at $(m_{0c}, m_{sc}) \simeq (2, 20) \mathrm{MeV}$ for the isospin symmetric mass for up and down quarks, $m_0$, and the strange quark mass, $m_s$, $T_{\mathrm{pc}}$ decreases with the magnetic field if the quark masses exceed the critical values, and increases as the quark masses become smaller. Related cosmological implications, arising when the supercooled electroweak phase transition or dark QCD cosmological phase transition is considered along with a primordial magnetic field, are also briefly addressed.</description>

      <title>New Angles on Energy Correlators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently come to the forefront of jet substructure studies at colliders due to their remarkable properties: they naturally separate physics at different scales, are robust to contamination from soft radiation, and offer a direct connection with quantum field theory. The current parametrization used for energy correlators, however, is based on redundant pairwise angles with complex phase space restrictions. In this Letter, we introduce a new parametrization of energy correlators that features a simpler phase space structure and preserves information about the orientation of jet constituents. Further, our parametrization drastically reduces the computational cost to compute energy correlators on experimental data; whereas the time to compute a traditional projected $N$-point energy correlator scales as $M^N/N!$ on a jet with $M$ particles, our new parametrization achieves a scaling of $M^2 \log M$, remarkably independently of N. Even for N=3, this improved scaling is particularly important for studies of heavy ion collisions, and higher values of $N$ will enable new qualitative understanding of gauge theories. Theoretical calculations for our new energy correlators differ from those of traditional parametrizations only at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy and beyond, and we expect that our simpler phase space structure will simplify those calculations. We also discuss how to extend our parametrization to resolved $N$-point energy correlators that encode angular distances between greater numbers of particles, yielding intuitive visualizations of jet substructure that are qualitatively different for different jet samples. We propose two possible generalizations for probing multi-prong jets and testing jet scaling behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.</description>

      <title>Radiation Exposure from the Dark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that exotic forms of dark matter could expose humans on Earth or on prolonged space travel to a significant radiation dose. The radiation exposure from dark matter interacting with nuclei in the human body is generally assumed to be negligible compared to other sources of background radiation. However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark matter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter is heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive particle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a significant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population, similar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background sources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to constrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We first consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the relevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how previous bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and space-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing radiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in space with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this parameter space. We finally propose a hypothetical dark matter candidate that scatters inelastically and argue that, in principle, one per mille of the Earth's population could attain a significant radiation dose from such a dark matter exposure in their lifetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore flavored resonant leptogenesis embedded in a neutrinophilic 2HDM. Successful leptogenesis is achieved by the very mildly degenerate two heavier right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), $N_2$ and $N_3$, with mass splitting of only $\Delta M_{32}/M_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1\%-1\%)$. The lightest RHN, with MeV-GeV-scale mass, lies below the sphaleron freeze-out temperature and remains stable, serving as a dark matter candidate. The model enables TeV-scale leptogenesis while avoiding the extreme mass degeneracy plagued conventional resonant leptogenesis. Baryon asymmetry, neutrino masses, and potentially the dark matter relic density can be addressed within a unified and experimentally testable framework.</description>

Abstract: We study the decay of a heavy CP-even neutral Higgs into an on-shell Standard Model-like Higgs boson and two photons, $H\to h\gamma\gamma$, in the two-Higgs doublet model. We argue that the decay channel $H\to h\gamma\gamma$, followed by the decay of the Standard Model Higgs $h\rightarrow b\bar b$, could be observed at the 5$\sigma$ level at the High-Luminosity LHC for masses of the heavy Higgs up to 950 GeV for the type-II, 650 GeV for the Lepton Specific and the Flipped 2HDMs, and 350 GeV for the type-I. We also discuss the possible role of the decay $H\to h\gamma\gamma$ in discriminating among different types of 2HDMs and in enhancing the total number of events in the final state $H\rightarrow b\bar b \gamma\gamma$ compared to the cascade decay $H\to hh$ followed by $h\to\gamma\gamma$ $h\to b\bar{b}$ with identical final state (although with different kinematical distributions).</description>

      <title>A common origin of the Higgs boson and the flavor hierarchies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model that extends the electroweak gauge symmetry of the Standard Model in a non-universal way to $SU(2)_{L}^{\prime}\times U(1)_X \times SU(2)_{L}^{q_3}\times SU(2)_R^{\ell_3}$. This symmetry is spontaneously broken to $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ near the TeV scale by a condensate of a new composite sector. Charging appropriately the fermionic degrees of freedom of the composite sector, anomaly cancellation enforces the Standard Model fermions to be charged in such a way that the extended gauge interactions respect a $U(2)_q\times U(2)_e\times U(3)_u\times U(3)_d\times U(3)_\ell$ accidental flavor symmetry. In addition, from the same symmetry breaking, a composite Higgs boson emerges as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the strong dynamics of the new sector. Due to the extended gauge and the specific flavor symmetry, leading Yukawa couplings between Higgs and fermions can only be written for the third generation and higher dimension operators generate suppressed light-family Yukawa couplings. Furthermore, CKM mixing angles between third and light families are naturally suppressed while the PMNS ones, anarchic. The model thus provides a unified origin for the Higgs boson and the flavor hierarchies between third and light families.</description>

Abstract: The scalar tetraquarks $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ with asymmetric contents $bb \overline{b}\overline{c}$ and $cc \overline{c}\overline{b}$ are explored using the QCD sum rule method. These states are modeled as the diquark-antidiquarks composed of the axial-vector components. The masses and current couplings of $T_{b}$ and $T_{c}$ are calculated using the two-point sum rule approach. The predictions obtained for the masses of these four-quark mesons prove that they are unstable against the strong two-meson fall-apart decays to conventional mesons. In the case of the tetraquark $ T_{b}$ this is the decay $T_{\mathrm{b}}\to \eta _{b}B_{c}^{-}$. The processes $T_{\mathrm{c}}\rightarrow \eta _{c}B_{c}^{+}$ and $J/\psi B_{c}^{\ast +}$ are kinematically allowed decay modes of the tetraquark $ T_{c}$. The widths of corresponding processes are evaluated by employing the QCD three-point sum rule approach which are necessary to estimate strong couplings at the tetraquark-meson-meson vertices of interest. The mass $ m=(15698 \pm 95)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $\Gamma[T_b]=(36.0 \pm 10.4)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ of the tetraquark $T_{b}$ as well as the parameters $ \widetilde{m}=(9680 \pm 102)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma[T_c]=(54.7 \pm 12.6)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ in the case of $T_{c}$ provide useful information to search for and interpret new exotic states.</description>

      <title>Laser induced Compton Scattering to Dark Matter in Effective Field Theory</title>

Abstract: The detection of light dark matter (DM) is a longstanding challenge in terrestrial experiments. High-intensity facility of an intense electromagnetic field may provide a plausible strategy to study strong-field particle physics and search for light DM. In this work, we propose to search for light DM particle through the nonlinear Compton scattering in the presence of a high-intense laser field. An ultra-relativistic electron beam collides with an intense laser pulse of a number of optical photons and then decays to a pair of DM particles. We take into account the Dirac-type fermionic DM in leptophilic scenario and the DM-electron interactions in the framework of effective field theory. The decay rates of electron to a DM pair are calculated for effective DM operators of different bilinear products. We show the sensitivities of laser induced Compton scattering to the effective cutoff scale for DM lighter than 1 MeV and compare with direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Visualizing How the Structure of Large-Radius Jets Shapes Their Wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ATLAS collaboration has introduced and implemented a strategy for selecting and analyzing large-radius jets composed of skinny $R=0.2$ subjets in heavy ion collisions at the LHC. We show how measurements of these jets teach us about the resolution length $L_{\rm res}$ of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and can teach us how jet substructure shapes the wakes that jets excite in the QGP droplets through which they pass. We use Hybrid Model calculations to reproduce measurements of $R_{AA}$ for large-radius jets in PbPb collisions, and study their dependence on the angle between the two skinny subjets involved in the final reclustering step of an $R=1$ jet. We show how these observables can constrain the value of $L_{\rm res}$ and demonstrate that the ATLAS data rule out any picture in which an entire parton shower loses energy coherently as if it were a single entity. Determining the degree to which the QGP can resolve partons within a jet is central to the broader program of using jet quenching measurements to probe QGP.
  We make further use of this setup by analyzing the response of the medium to the passage of large-radius $R=2$ jets containing two skinny subjets in gamma-jet events. We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to visualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that wide jets with two skinny subjets excite in a droplet of QGP, as a function of the angular separation between the subjets. We find that even when they are $\sim 0.8- 1$ radian apart, a single broad wake is produced. Only when the two subjets are even farther apart is the presence of two sub-wakes revealed. We show that the way in which jet structure shapes jet wakes can be visualized with similar clarity in experiments by using only those hadrons with low $p_T$. These observables thus offer a new and distinctive way of seeing jet wakes in heavy ion collision data.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation in reactor neutrino experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent reactor neutrino oscillation experiments reported precision measurements of $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ and $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ under the standard 3$\nu$ oscillation framework. However, inter-experiment consistency checks through the parameter goodness-of-fit test reveal proximity to the tension boundary, with the Double Chooz, RENO, and Daya Bay ensemble yielding $p_\text{PG}=0.14$ vs threshold $\alpha=0.1$. Anisotropic Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can accommodate this tension by introducing a location-dependent angle $\theta^\text{LIV}$ relative to the earth's axis. It is found that anisotropic LIV improve the fit to data up to 1.9$\sigma$ confidence level significance, with the coefficient $\mathcal{A}^{C(0)}_{31} = 2.43\times 10^{-17}\text{ MeV}$ yielding the best fit, while Parameter Goodness-of-fit (PG) is significantly improved within the LIV formalism.</description>

      <title>Can the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma be measured from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$; however, we also observe that $\langle p_T \rangle$ and $N$ are not sufficiently accurate proxies for the energy and entropy to make this possible in practice. From simulations, we find that the exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is significantly different whether the ''effective volume'' is strictly constant or not, a condition that cannot be enforced experimentally. Additional tests using a modified equation of state find that the exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ exhibits a variable degree of correlations with the speed of sound and with $P/\varepsilon$, but is not an accurate measurement of either quantity in general.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing the gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including discovering multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) under strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <title>Quintessence: an analytical study, with theoretical and observational applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on minimally coupled (multi)field quintessence models, of thawing type, and their realistic solutions. In a model-independent manner, we describe analytically these cosmological solutions throughout the universe history. Starting with a kination - radiation domination phase, we obtain an upper bound on the scalar potential to guarantee an early kination: $V(\varphi) \ll e^{-\sqrt{6} \varphi}$. Turning to the radiation - matter phase, we obtain analytic expressions for the scale factor $a(t)$ (not $t(a)$) and the scalar fields $\varphi^i(t)$ (usually neglected). These allow us to evaluate analytically the freezing of scalar fields, typically $\Delta \varphi \lesssim 10^{-2}$, as well as the transition moment of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_{\varphi}$ from $+1$ to $-1$, with excellent agreement to the numerics. We comment on this freezing in view of string theory model building, and of some cosmological events. Turning to the latest phase of matter - dark energy domination, we show that the (multi)field displacement is sub-Planckian: $\Delta \varphi \leq 1$. We also provide for that phase analytic expressions for $\int (w_{\varphi}+1)\, d N$ in terms of matter evolution; we relate those to observational targets that we propose. Using finally the CPL parametrisation, while discussing a phantom behaviour, we derive analytic bounds on $w_0$ and $w_a$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <title>How deep is the dip and how tall are the wiggles in inflationary power spectra?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear scalar perturbations in single-field models of inflation featuring a non-attractor phase. These models lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum that may result in the formation of primordial black holes. We develop a transfer-matrix formalism, analogous to the S-matrix program in quantum-field theory, that maps perturbations throughout the transitory phase. At scales smaller than the peak, the power spectrum features damped oscillations, and the duration of the transition sets the scale at which power-law damping switches to exponential damping. At scales larger than the peak, we demonstrate that a dip appears in the power spectrum if and only if the inflaton's velocity does not flip sign. We show that the amplitude at the dip always scales as the inverse square-rooted amplitude of the peak, and comment on the physical consequences of this universal relationship. We also test the robustness of our results with a few toy models and interpret them with an intuitive mechanical analogy.</description>

      <title>Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi |^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several common features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos by Hydrogen-rich Supernovae interacting with low-massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2023ixf</title>

Abstract: In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ (including $0.07\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\,\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\pm1\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\lesssim 3\times 10^{-9}\,\text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\nu$ from similar SN events.</description>

      <title>Quantum energies of solitons with different topological charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum polarization energy is the leading quantum correction to the classical energy of a soliton. We study this energy for two-component solitons in one space dimension as a function of the soliton's topological charge. We find that both the classical and the vacuum polarization energies are linear functions of the topological charge with a small offset. Because the combination of the classical and quantum offsets determines the binding energies, either all higher charge solitons are energetically bound or they are all unbound, depending on model parameters. This linearity persists even when the field configurations are very different from those of isolated solitons, and would not be apparent from an analysis of their bound state spectra alone.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing hadronically decaying tau leptons with a jet foundation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited availability and accuracy of simulated data has motivated the use of foundation models in high energy physics, with the idea to first train a task-agnostic model on large and potentially unlabeled datasets. This enables the subsequent fine-tuning of the learned representation for specific downstream tasks, potentially requiring much smaller dataset sizes to reach the performance of models trained from scratch. We study how OmniJet-$\alpha$, one of the proposed foundation models for particle jets, can be used on a new set of tasks, and in a new dataset, in order to reconstruct hadronically decaying $\tau$ leptons. We show that the pretraining can successfully be utilized for this multi-task problem, improving the resolution of momentum reconstruction by about 50\% when the pretrained weights are fine-tuned, compared to training the model from scratch. While much work remains ahead to develop generic foundation models for high-energy physics, this early result of generalizing an existing model to a new dataset and to previously unconsidered tasks highlights the importance of testing the approaches on a diverse set of datasets and tasks.</description>
