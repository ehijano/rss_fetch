      <title>Real-time Level-of-Detail Strand-based Hair Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strand-based hair rendering has become increasingly popular in production for its realistic appearance. However, the prevailing level-of-detail solution employing hair cards for distant hair models introduces a significant discontinuity in dynamics and appearance during the transition from strands to cards. We introduce an innovative real-time framework for strand-based hair rendering that ensures seamless transitions between different levels of detail (LOD) while maintaining a consistent hair appearance. Our method uses elliptical thick hairs that contain multiple hair strands at each LOD to maintain the shapes of hair clusters. In addition to geometric fitting, we formulate an elliptical Bidirectional Curve Scattering Distribution Functions (BCSDF) model for a thick hair, accurately capturing single scattering and multiple scattering within the hair cluster, accommodating a spectrum from sparse to dense hair distributions. Our framework, tested on various hairstyles with dynamics as well as knits, shows that it can produce highly similar appearances to full hair geometries at different viewing distances with seamless LOD transitions, while achieving up to a 3x speedup.</description>

      <title>Semantic Gesticulator: Semantics-Aware Co-Speech Gesture Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present Semantic Gesticulator, a novel framework designed to synthesize realistic gestures accompanying speech with strong semantic correspondence. Semantically meaningful gestures are crucial for effective non-verbal communication, but such gestures often fall within the long tail of the distribution of natural human motion. The sparsity of these movements makes it challenging for deep learning-based systems, trained on moderately sized datasets, to capture the relationship between the movements and the corresponding speech semantics. To address this challenge, we develop a generative retrieval framework based on a large language model. This framework efficiently retrieves suitable semantic gesture candidates from a motion library in response to the input speech. To construct this motion library, we summarize a comprehensive list of commonly used semantic gestures based on findings in linguistics, and we collect a high-quality motion dataset encompassing both body and hand movements. We also design a novel GPT-based model with strong generalization capabilities to audio, capable of generating high-quality gestures that match the rhythm of speech. Furthermore, we propose a semantic alignment mechanism to efficiently align the retrieved semantic gestures with the GPT's output, ensuring the naturalness of the final animation. Our system demonstrates robustness in generating gestures that are rhythmically coherent and semantically explicit, as evidenced by a comprehensive collection of examples. User studies confirm the quality and human-likeness of our results, and show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art systems in terms of semantic appropriateness by a clear margin.</description>

      <title>Rasterized Edge Gradients: Handling Discontinuities Differentiably</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the gradients of a rendering process is paramount for diverse applications in computer vision and graphics. However, accurate computation of these gradients is challenging due to discontinuities and rendering approximations, particularly for surface-based representations and rasterization-based rendering. We present a novel method for computing gradients at visibility discontinuities for rasterization-based differentiable renderers. Our method elegantly simplifies the traditionally complex problem through a carefully designed approximation strategy, allowing for a straightforward, effective, and performant solution. We introduce a novel concept of micro-edges, which allows us to treat the rasterized images as outcomes of a differentiable, continuous process aligned with the inherently non-differentiable, discrete-pixel rasterization. This technique eliminates the necessity for rendering approximations or other modifications to the forward pass, preserving the integrity of the rendered image, which makes it applicable to rasterized masks, depth, and normals images where filtering is prohibitive. Utilizing micro-edges simplifies gradient interpretation at discontinuities and enables handling of geometry intersections, offering an advantage over the prior art. We showcase our method in dynamic human head scene reconstruction, demonstrating effective handling of camera images and segmentation masks.</description>
