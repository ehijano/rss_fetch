      <title>Interacting Electronic Topology of Nonlocal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal crystals are systems with translational symmetry but arbitrary range couplings or interactions between degrees of freedom. We argue that the notion of topology in such systems does not collapse to that in zero dimensions, as one may naively expect in view of the infinite interaction range. At the same time, we show that the range of available topological phases can be enriched in comparison to the case with local interactions. This is demonstrated by constructing an example of a fermionic symmetry-protected phase in one dimension in symmetry class AII with inversion symmetry, using a Hatsugai-Kohmoto-type model. The new phase exists only in a nonlocal crystal with electron-electron interactions and can be identified from symmetry eigenvalues. We construct an associated topological charge pump as a physical manifestation of its topology.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Holography in Quantum Phases via Twisted R\'enyi-N Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic framework for the entanglement Hamiltonian in symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with area-law entanglement, whose reduced density matrix $\rho \propto e^{-H_e}$ can be treated as a lower-dimensional mixed state. By replicating $\rho$, we reconstruct the fixed-point SPT wavefunction, establishing an exact correspondence between the bulk strange correlator of the (d+1)-dimensional SPT state and the twisted R\'enyi-N operator of the d-dimensional reduced density matrix. Notably, the reduced density matrix exhibits long-range or quasi-long-range order along the replica direction, revealing a universal entanglement feature in SPT phases. As a colloary, we generalized the framework of twisted R\'enyi-N correlator to thermal states and open quantum systems, providing an alternative formulation of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem, applicable to both closed and open systems. Finally, we extend our protocol to mixed-state SPT phases and introduce new quantum information metrics -- twisted R\'enyi-N correlators of the surgery operator -- to characterize the topology of mixed states.</description>

      <title>Worldline deconfinement and emergent long-range interaction in entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a system exhibits a bulk gap but gapless edge states (e.g., a symmetry-protected topological phase), the entanglement spectrum (ES) resembles the energy spectrum on virtual edge, that is the Li-Haldane conjecture. In this way, the ES plays an important probe to detect the topological phases according to this bulk-edge correspondence. When a system is fully gapped, both in bulk and edge, the ES still remains similar to the virtual edge spectrum which can be explained by the recently proposed wormhole effect in the path integral of reduced density matrix. However, what will happen in the ES when the system is fully gapless? We find that though the ES roughly seems like an edge energy spectrum, and it actually contains relevant long-range interaction which modifies the intrinsic physics of entanglement Hamiltonian (EH). Moreover, the mechanism of short-/long-range interaction in EH can be understood as the confinement/deconfinement of worldlines in a path integral of reduced density matrix. Our work demonstrates that the gapless mode can induce a long-range interaction in EH.</description>

      <title>Neel order, spin-spiral, and spin liquid ground state in frustrated three dimensional system CaMn2P2: A DFT+U and spin dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic ground state and phase transitions in the frustrated three-dimensional system CaMn2P2 using first-principles calculations combined with spin-dynamics simulations. Our DFT+U calculations reveal that CaMn2P2 exhibits an indirect gap semiconducting ground state with a localized Mn2+ electronic configuration and negligible spin-orbit coupling effects. The computed exchange interactions show that the magnetic behavior is well described by a isotropic Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In this model, there are two major couplings: the NN interaction J1 couples the two Mn layers along the c-axis and next NN J2 is in the a-b plane where Mn ions form a hexagonal layer structure. Our results show that both J1 and J2 are antiferromagnetic in nature and as a consequence J2 induce frustration owing to the in-plane triangular geometry of the Mn-ions. The J1 is found to promote long-range antiferromagnetic order, while the J2 is responsible for spin canting and disorder. Our spin-wave analysis confirms that the system stabilizes a spin-spiral ground state with a propagation vector q = (1/6 , 1/6, 0) in agreement with neutron diffraction experiments. By tuning the J2/J1 ratio, we construct a phase diagram that reveals a transition from a collinear Neel antiferromagnetic state to different spin-spiral phases, and eventually to a disordered phase at large frustration. Atomistic spin-dynamics simulations capture the temperature evolution of the magnetism and reproduce the experimentally measured magnetic data with good accuracy. Furthermore, for large J2/J1, we identify a low temperature phase with slow spin relaxation and persistent fluctuations, suggesting a spin-liquid like state. Our study provides an understanding of frustration induced magnetism in CaMn2P2 and establishes it as a realization of J1-J2 model in three-dimensional lattice for exploring emergent magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Rules on Multipole Interactions under Crystallographic Point Groups and Application to Multiple-$Q$ Multipole States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipole degrees of freedom describe the mutual interplay among the charge, spin, and orbital degrees of freedom in electrons, which provides a microscopic understanding of unconventional electronic orderings and their associated physical phenomena. We here show the symmetry rules on multipole interactions under crystallographic point groups in a systematic manner. Depending on the bond symmetries, we show the necessary symmetry conditions of the antisymmetric multipole interactions, which correspond to the extension of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, as well as the symmetric ones, which correspond to the extension of the compasslike interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the symmetry-allowed multipole interactions can become a source of exotic multiple-$Q$ multipole orderings. As a specific example, we analyze the effective model with the antisymmetric quadrupole interaction on a triangular lattice and show the emergence of the triple-$Q$ quadrupole state. Our results indicate that multipole interactions that often arise from the heavy-fermion, frustrated, and nematic systems can potentially induce further unconventional quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated topological surface states in type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontrivial topology in type-II Dirac semimetal NiTe$_2$ leading to topologically protected surface states give rise to fascinating phenomena holding great promise for next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. Key parameters $-$ such as lattice parameter, disorder, vacancies, and electron correlation $-$ significantly influence the electronic structure and, subsequently, the physical properties. To resolve the discrepancy between the theoretical description and experimentally observed topological surface states, we comprehensively investigate the electronic structure of NiTe$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory. Although the bulk electronic structure is found to be well-described within mean field approaches, an accurate description of topological surface states is obtained only by incorporating surface electronic correlation. We reveal that the strongly correlated surface states forming Dirac-like conical crossing much below Fermi level have hybridized Ni 3$d$ and Te 5$p$ character. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between electron correlation and band topology, broadening our understanding of many-body correlation effects on the topological surface states in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Exact zero modes in the interacting Majorana X- and Y-junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the appearance of exact zero modes in junctions of interacting Majorana wires. We consider two, three and four short Majorana chains coupled to each other at one edge and forming a longer chain with an impurity bond, Y- and X- junctions correspondingly. The exact zero modes emerge as a result of incommensurate short-range correlations resulting from interacting Majorana fermions and manifest themselves as unavoided crossing of energy levels of in-gap states continuously tuned by hopping and interaction strength. For the Y- and X-junctions, we detect four in-gap states that are clearly visible below the bulk excitations. In the X-junction, the energy levels cross pairwise; in the Y-junction, the crossings happen simultaneously in all four levels. We argue that this peculiarity is a result of fractional degrees of freedom localized at the center of junctions with an odd number of arms, which mediate the interaction of the outer edge states. Furthermore, we show that zero modes in multiple-arm junctions can be effectively modeled by a single chain with a strong impurity bond.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals: an emerging structure-type for anisotropic Kondo lattice studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic investigations of rare-earth ($R$) based intermetallic materials is a leading strategy to reveal the underlying mechanisms governing a range of physical phenomena, such as the formation of a Kondo lattice and competing electronic and magnetic anisotropies. In this work, the magnetic, thermal and transport properties of $R$Co$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ ($R=$ La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Sm) single crystals are presented. LaCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is characterized as a Pauli paramagnet and transport measurements, with the current along and perpendicular to the orthorhombic $c$-axis ($\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$, respectively), reveal a clear electronic anisotropy, with $\rho_{ab }\approx(4-7)\rho_{c }$ at $300$ K. We show that CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$ is a Kondo-lattice for which the Kondo coherence temperature $T_{\text{K}}^{*}$, deduced from broad maximums in $\rho_{c}$ and $\rho_{ab}$ at $\approx$ 68 and 46 K, respectively, is also anisotropic. This finding is related to a possible underlying anisotropy of the Kondo coupling in CeCo$_{2}$Al$_{8}$. The Pr and Nd-based materials present strong easy-axis anisotropy ($c$-axis) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) orders below $T=4.84$ K and $T=8.1$ K, respectively. Metamagnetic transitions from this AFM to a spin-polarized paramagnetic phase state are investigated by isothermal magnetization measurements. The Sm-based compound is also an easy-axis AFM with a transition at $T=21.6$ K.</description>

      <title>Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, et. al., arXiv:2504.06972 which displays a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at a filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a magnetic phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a phase with zero Chern number, potentially corresponding to an inter-valley coherent state. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have an inter-valley coherent normal state.</description>

Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum R\'enyi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any R\'enyi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for the ultralow room-temperature resistivity of SrMoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with exceptionally low resistivities at room temperature are currently heavily sought after for next-generation interconnects. SrMoO$_3$ has one of the lowest experimentally-reported room-temperature resistivities, yet the origin of this property has remained a mystery. Using the Boltzmann transport equation we determine that electron-phonon scattering limits transport at room temperature and is responsible for the approximate $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity at intermediate temperatures, often attributed to electron-electron Fermi-liquid scattering. We show that the weak electron-phonon coupling, which is similar to, e.g., copper, combined with high electron group velocities for states near the Fermi level, explains the low resistivity of SrMoO$_3$. Additionally, the strength of the electron-phonon coupling is found to be sensitive to structural distortions, which may explain disagreements in the literature between single crystal and thin film measurements. The electron-phonon scattering in SrMoO$_3$ is insensitive to static Coulomb interactions in the partially-filled transition-metal $d$ orbitals, in contrast to similar oxides such as SrVO$_3$. These findings have significant implications for theoretical interpretation of direct-current resistivity in transition-metal oxides and beyond.</description>

      <title>Topotactic oxidation of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reveals new structural family: oxygen-intercalated layered perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered perovskites such as the Dion-Jacobson, Ruddlesden-Popper, and Aurivillius families host a wide range of correlated electron phenomena, from high-temperature superconductivity to multiferroicity. Here we report a new family of layered perovskites, realized through topotactic oxygen intercalation of La_{n+1}Ni_{n}O_{3n+1} (n=1-4) Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate thin films grown by ozone-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy. Post-growth ozone annealing induces a large c-axis expansion - 17.8% for La_{2}NiO_{4} (n=1) - that monotonically decreases with increasing n. Surface X-ray diffraction coupled with Coherent Bragg Rod Analysis reveals that this structural expansion arises from the intercalation of approximately 0.7 oxygen atoms per formula unit into interstitial sites within the rock salt spacer layers. The resulting structures exhibit a spacer layer composition intermediate between that of the Ruddlesden-Popper and Aurivillius phases, defining a new class of layered perovskites. Oxygen-intercalated nickelates exhibit metallicity and significantly enhanced nickel-oxygen hybridization, a feature linked to high-temperature superconductivity. Our work establishes topotactic oxidation as a powerful synthetic approach to accessing highly oxidized, metastable phases across a broad range of layered oxide systems, offering new platforms to tune properties via spacer-layer chemistry.</description>

Abstract: Coupled Lindblad pseudomode theory is a promising approach for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics on both classical and quantum platforms, with dynamics that can be realized as a quantum channel. We provide theoretical evidence that the number of coupled pseudomodes only needs to scale as $\mathrm{polylog}(T/\varepsilon)$ in the simulation time $T$ and precision $\varepsilon$. Inspired by the realization problem in control theory, we also develop a robust numerical algorithm for constructing the coupled modes that avoids the non-convex optimization required by existing approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing population dynamics and absorption spectra for the spin-boson model. This work provides a significant theoretical and computational improvement to the coupled Lindblad framework, which impacts a broad range of applications from classical simulations of quantum impurity problems to quantum simulations on near-term quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary lattice.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions of von Neumann entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study two-point correlation functions of modular Hamiltonians. We show that in general quantum systems, these correlators obey properties similar to those of von Neumann entropy and capacity of entanglement, both of which are special cases of these correlators. Then we specialize to two spacelike-separated spherical subregions in conformal field theories. We present direct computations of the vacuum two-point function that confirm its equivalence to the stress-tensor conformal block. We explore the two-point function in various kinematic regimes, including imaginary time separation between subsystems. The material presented in this note may be useful for further studying modular Hamiltonian correlators in generic quantum systems and in conformal field theories, including those with holographic duals.</description>

      <title>From Fractionalization to Chiral Topological Superconductivity in Flat Chern Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interacting electrons in a flat Chern band can form, in addition to fractional Chern insulators, a chiral $f$-wave topological superconductor that hosts neutral Majorana fermion edge modes. Superconductivity emerges from an interaction-induced metallic state that exhibits anomalous Hall effect, as observed in rhombohedral graphene and near the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ fractional Chern insulator in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Anderson Impurities In Edge States with Nonlinear and Dissipative Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that exceptional points (EPs) and non-Hermitian behavior can emerge dynamically in impurity models with Hermitian microscopic origins. Using perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis, Fock-space diagonalization, and spin-spin relaxation time calculations, we demonstrate that nonlinear (NL) dispersion and anisotropic pseudochiral (PC) interactions generate complex fixed points and spectral defectiveness. The effective Kondo model features a square-root RG invariant linking planar and longitudinal Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya (DM) couplings, driving the onset of EPs. Our analysis reveals dissipative fixed points stabilized by an emergent Lie algebra structure and a scaling collapse in relaxation dynamics. Across both single- and two-impurity extensions, we identify a universal ``sign-reversion'' (SR) regime near critical NL coupling, where anisotropy preserves PC symmetry and SR serves as a signature of non-Hermitian flow. These results establish a new class of non-Hermitian criticality generated through RG evolution in otherwise Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Functional interpolation expansion for nonequilibrium correlated impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.</description>

      <title>Exact, Average, and Broken Symmetries in a Simple Adaptive Monitored Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for understanding phases of matter in equilibrium. Quantum circuits with measurements have recently emerged as a platform for novel states of matter intrinsically out of equilibrium. Can symmetry be used as an organizing principle for these novel states, their phases and phase transitions? In this work, we give an affirmative answer to this question in a simple adaptive monitored circuit, which hosts an ordering transition in addition to a separate entanglement transition, upon tuning a single parameter. Starting from a symmetry-breaking initial state, depending on the tuning parameter, the steady state could (i) remain symmetry-broken, (ii) exhibit the average symmetry in the ensemble of trajectories, or (iii) exhibit the exact symmetry for each trajectory. The ordering transition is mapped to the transition in a classical majority vote model, described by the Ising universality class, while the entanglement transition lies in the percolation class. Numerical simulations are further presented to support the analytical understandings.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Approach to Wannier Pairing and Bogoliubov Orbitals in Square-Octagon Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-energy lattice models are the cornerstone for studying many-body physics and interactions between the system and measurement fields. A key challenge is identifying appropriate quasiparticle states that canonically transform between momentum and real space while retaining the correlation, entanglement, and geometric properties - generally called the Wannier obstruction. Here, we introduce a phase-space approach to bypass these obstructions. Instead of treating the phase space as a manifold, we embed a real space through a Bloch vector space at each momentum. Orbital and spin states are introduced through product states with the Bloch vector, while quantum statistics, correlations, topology, and entanglements are inherited from the Hamiltonian. We apply this framework to explore the unconventional pairing symmetry and the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation in phase space. Our findings demonstrate that while superconductivity exhibits global coherence, the local Wannier orbital symmetry primarily determines the pairing symmetry. We analytically solve the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing symmetry on the phase space by engineering a flat band with artificial gauge fields. We validate the model on the square-octagon superconductor Lu$_2$Fe$_3$Si$_5$ using density functional theory (DFT), revealing the coexistence of nodeless $s^{\pm}$ and nodal $s_{z^2}$ pairing symmetries. This phase-space framework provides a robust, obstruction-free lattice model for complex many-body systems and their exotic excitations.</description>
