      <title>Reverse Shock Revisited in Cassiopeia A with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using data from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, we revisited the reverse shock in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A.Based on the spectroscopic of a series of annuli in the northwest (NW) and southeast (SE), we get the radial profiles of the S/Si K-alpha line flux ratio and Fe K-alpha line centroid energy. They both show monotonic increase, confirming that the Si- and Fe-rich ejecta are heated by the reverse shock.The abrupt change of the S and Si line flux ratio is clearly observed in Cassiopeia A, leading to the determination of the reverse shock location (~1.71+-0.16 arcmin and ~1.35+-0.18 arcmin in the NW and SE, with respect to the central source). By comparing the radial profiles of S and Si line flux, we find that the reverse shock is moving outward in the frame of the observer, and the velocities are ~3950+-210 km/s and ~2900+-260 km/s in the NW and SE, respectively. In contrast, the velocities become ~1150 km/s (NW) and ~1300 km/s (SE) in the ejecta frame. Our measured reverse shock velocities are quite consistent with those obtained from the X-ray and/or optical images. It therefore supplies a crosscheck of the accuracy for the two available methods to measure the reverse shock velocity in SNRs. Both the location and the velocity of the reverse shock show apparent asymmetry, suggesting that the asymmetric explosion of the progenitor plays a key role in the interaction between the reverse shock and the ejecta, ultimately shaping complex features observed in SNRs.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Followup Could Have Enabled the Discovery of the GW190425 Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a kilonova associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star merger had far-reaching implications for our understanding of several open questions in physics and astrophysics. Unfortunately, since then, only one robust binary neutron star merger was detected through gravitational waves, GW190425, and no electromagnetic counterpart was identified for it. We analyze all reported electromagnetic followup observations of GW190425 and find that while the gravitational-wave localization uncertainty was large, most of the 90% probability region could have been covered within hours had the search been coordinated. Instead, more than 5 days after the merger, the uncoordinated search covered only 50% of the probability, with some areas observed over 100 times, and some never observed. We further show that, according to some models, it would have been possible to detect the GW190425 kilonova, despite the larger distance and higher component masses compared to GW170817. These results emphasize the importance of coordinating followup of gravitational-wave events, not only to avoid missing future kilonovae, but also to discover them early. Such coordination, which is especially important given the rarity of these events, can be achieved with the Treasure Map, a tool developed specifically for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Tleco: A Toolkit for Modeling Radiative Signatures from Relativistic Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of astrophysical sources exhibit extreme and rapidly varying electromagnetic emission indicative of efficient non-thermal particle acceleration. Understanding these sources often involves comparing data with a broad range of theoretical scenarios. To this end, it is beneficial to have tools that enable not only fast and efficient parametric investigation of the predictions of a specific scenario but also the flexibility to explore different theoretical ideas. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Tleco}, a versatile and lightweight toolkit for developing numerical models of relativistic outflows, including their particle acceleration mechanisms and resultant electromagnetic signature. Built on the Rust programming language and wrapped into a Python library, \texttt{Tleco} offers efficient algorithms for evolving relativistic particle distributions and for solving the resulting emissions in a customizable fashion. \texttt{Tleco} uses a fully implicit discretization algorithm to solve the Fokker-Planck (FP) equation with user-defined diffusion, advection, cooling, injection, and escape, and offers prescriptions for radiative emission and cooling. These include, but are not limited to, synchrotron, inverse-Compton, and self-synchrotron absorption. \texttt{Tleco} is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to model particle acceleration and the resulting electromagnetic spectrum and temporal variability in a wide variety of astrophysical scenarios, including, but not limited to, gamma-ray bursts, pulsar wind nebulae, and jets from active galactic nuclei. In this work, we outline the core algorithms and proceed to evaluate and demonstrate their effectiveness. The code is open-source and available in the GitHub repository: \href{https://github.com/zkdavis/Tleco</description>

      <title>HERMES: Gamma Ray Burst and Gravitational Wave counterpart hunter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) bridge relativistic astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy. Space-based gamma/X-ray wide field detectors have proven essential to detect and localize the highly variable GRB prompt emission, which is also a counterpart of gravitational wave events. We study the capabilities to detect long and short GRBs by the High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites (HERMES) Pathfinder (HP) and SpIRIT, namely a swarm of six 3U CubeSats to be launched in early 2025, and a 6U CubeSat launched on December 1st 2023. We also study the capabilities of two advanced configurations of swarms of &gt;8 satellites with improved detector performances (HERMES Constellations). The HERMES detectors, sensitive down to ~2-3 keV, will be able to detect faint/soft GRBs which comprise X-ray flashes and high redshift bursts. By combining state-of-the-art long and short GRB population models with a description of the single module performance, we estimate that HP will detect ~195^{+22}_{-21} long GRBs (3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.8} at redshift z&gt;6) and ~19^{+5}_{-3} short GRBs per year. The larger HERMES Constellations under study can detect between ~1300 and ~3000 long GRBs per year and between ~160 and ~400 short GRBs per year, depending on the chosen configuration, with a rate of long GRBs above z&gt;6 between 30 and 75 per year. Finally, we explore the capabilities of HERMES to detect short GRBs as electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers detected as gravitational signals by current and future ground-based interferometers. Under the assumption that the GRB jets are structured, we estimate that HP can provide up to 1 (14) yr^{-1} joint detections during the fifth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (Einstein Telescope single triangle 10 km arm configuration). These numbers become 4 (100) yr^{-1}, respectively, for the HERMES Constellation configuration.</description>

      <title>Searching for the highest energy of pulsation and critical luminosity of Swift J0243.6+6124 observed by Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the broad energy coverage of Insight-HXMT in the hard X-ray band, we detected the highest energy of pulsation exceeding 200 keV around the 2017-2018 outburst peak of the first Galactic pulsating ultraluminous X-ray source (PULX) Swift J0243.6+6124, which is the highest energy detected from PULXs to date. We also obtained the highest energy of pulsation of every exposure during the outburst in 2017-2018, and found the highest energy is roughly positively correlated with luminosity. Using our newly developed method, we identified the critical luminosity being $4\times 10^{38}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$ when the main peaks of the low and high energy pulse profiles became aligned, which separates the fan-beam dominated and pencil-beam dominated accretion regimes. Above the critical luminosity, the phase of the main peak shifted gradually from 0.5 to 0.8 until the outburst peak in all energy bands is reached, which is in agreement with the phase shift found previously at low energies. Our result is consistent with what is derived from spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>The effect of interstellar medium on LVK's black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation alone is not efficient in hardening the orbit of a wide binary black hole (BBH). By employing a toy model for the interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding BBHs, here we discuss the effect of this baryonic medium on BBH dynamics. Depending on the BBH's mass, we show that a binary surrounded by an isotropic cold neutral medium (i.e., an asymptotic temperature $T_{\infty} \approx 100$ K) with a time-averaged particle density of $\langle n_H \rangle = \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^{-3}$ can play a significant role in hardening the binary orbit over a $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ yr time scale. Additionally, this causes the black hole's mass to grow at a rate $\propto m^2$. We thus discuss the impact of the ISM on the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observables and quantify the properties of the ISM under which the latter could act as an additional important pathway for driving a subset of LVK's BBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Deep learning inference of the neutron star equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Particle Acceleration and Pitch-Angle Anisotropy Driven by Magnetic Reconnection: Ion-Electron Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle acceleration and pitch-angle anisotropy resulting from magnetic reconnection are investigated in highly magnetized ion-electron plasmas. By means of fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that magnetic reconnection generates anisotropic particle distributions $f_s \left( {|\cos \alpha|,\varepsilon} \right)$, characterized by broken power laws in the particle energy spectrum $f_s (\varepsilon) \propto \varepsilon^{-p}$ and pitch angle $\langle \sin^2 \alpha \rangle \propto \varepsilon^m$. Their characteristics are determined by the ratio of the guide field to the reconnecting field ($B_g/B_0$) and the plasma magnetization ($\sigma_0$). Below the break energy $\varepsilon_0$, ion and electron energy spectra are extremely hard ($p_&lt;\lesssim 1$) for any $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, while above $\varepsilon_0$, the spectral index steepens ($p_&gt; \gtrsim 2$), displaying high sensitivity to both $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0$. The pitch angle displays power-law ranges with negative slopes ($m_&lt;$) below and positive slopes ($m_&gt;$) above $\varepsilon_{\min \alpha}$, steepening with increasing $B_g/B_0$ and $\sigma_0$. The ratio $B_g/B_0$ regulates the redistribution of magnetic energy between ions ($\Delta E_i$) and electrons ($\Delta E_e$), with $\Delta E_i \gg \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \ll 1$, $\Delta E_i \sim \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \sim 1$, and $\Delta E_i \ll \Delta E_e$ for $B_g/B_0 \gg 1$, with $\Delta E_i/\Delta E_e$ approaching unity when $\sigma_0 \gg 1$. The anisotropic distribution of accelerated particles results in an optically thin synchrotron power spectrum $F_\nu(\nu) \propto\nu^{(2-2p+m)/(4+m)}$ and a linear polarization degree $\Pi_{\rm lin} = (p+1)/(p+7/3+m/3)$. Pitch-angle anisotropy also induces temperature anisotropy and eases synchrotron cooling, along with producing beamed radiation, potentially responsible for frequency-dependent variability.</description>

      <title>FAST Discovery of Eight Isolated Millisecond Pulsars in NGC 6517</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 8 isolated millisecond pulsars in Globular Cluster (GC) NGC 6517 using the Five-Hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The spin periods of those pulsars (namely PSR J1801-0857K to R, or, NGC 6517K to R) are all shorter than 10 ms. With these discoveries, NGC 6517 is currently the GC with the most known pulsars in the FAST sky. The largest difference in dispersion measure of the pulsars in NGC 6517 is 11.2 cm$^{-3}$ pc, the second among all GCs. The fraction of isolated pulsars in this GC (16 of 17, 94$\%$) is consistent with previous studies indicating an overabundance of isolated pulsars in the densest GCs, especially in those undergoing cluster core collapse. Considering the FAST GC pulsar discoveries, we modeled the GC pulsar population using the empirical Bayesian method described by Turk and Lorimer with the recent counts. Using this approach, we find that the expected number of potential pulsars in GCs seems to be correlated with the central escape velocity, hence, the GCs Liller 1, NGC 6441, M54 (NGC 6715), and $\omega$-Cen (NGC 5139) are expected to host the largest numbers of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Afterglow Linear Polarization Signatures from Shallow GRB Jets: Implications for Energetic GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are powered by ultra-relativistic jets. The launching sites of these jets are surrounded by dense media, which the jets must cross before they can accelerate and release the high energy emission. Interaction with the medium leads to the formation of a mildly relativistic sheath around the jet resulting in an angular structures in the jet's asymptotic Lorentz factor and energy per solid angle, which modifies the afterglow emission. We build a semi-analytical tool to analyze the afterglow light curve and polarization signatures of jets observed from a wide range of viewing angles, and focus on ones with slowly declining energy profiles known as shallow jets. We find overall lower polarization compared to the classical top-hat jet model. We provide an analytical expression for the peak polarization degree as a function of the energy profile power-law index, magnetic field configuration and viewing angle, and show that it occurs near the light curve break time for all viewers. When applying our tool to GRB 221009A, suspected to originate from a shallow jet, we find that the suggested jet structures for this event agree with the upper limits placed on the afterglow polarization in the optical and X-ray bands. We also find that at early times the polarization levels may be significantly higher, allowing for a potential distinction between different jet structure models and possibly constraining the magnetization in both forward and reverse shocks at that stage.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection has enabled us to test General Relativity in an entirely new regime. A prominent role in tests of General Relativity takes the detection of the Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) that arise as the highly distorted remnant formed after the merger emits GWs until it becomes a regular Kerr BH. According to the no-hair theorem, the frequencies and damping times of these QNMs are determined solely by the mass and spin of the remnant BH. Therefore, detecting the QNMs offers a unique way to probe the nature of the remnant BH and to test General Relativity. We study the detection of a merging binary black hole (BBH) in the intermediate mass range, where the inspiral-merger phase is detected by space-based laser interferometer detectors TianQin and LISA while the ringdown is detected by the ground-based atom interferometer (AI) observatory AION. The analysis of the ringdown is done using the regular broadband mode of AI detectors as well as using the resonant mode where the detection band is optimized to the frequencies of the QNMs predicted from the inspiral-merger phase. We find that using the regular broadband mode allows constraining the parameters of the BBH with relative errors of at most $10^{-6}$ from the ringdown while the frequencies and the damping times of the QNMs can be determined with total errors below $0.2\,{\rm Hz}$ and $115\,{\rm \mu s}$, respectively. Furthermore, we find that using the resonant mode can improve the parameter estimation for the BBH from the ringdown by up to one order of magnitude. Utilizing the resonant mode significantly limits the detection of the frequency of the QNMs but improves the detection error of the damping times by one to four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>TeV Solar Gamma Rays as a probe for the Solar Internetwork Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic fields that emerge from beneath the solar surface and permeate the solar atmosphere are the key drivers of space weather and, thus, understanding them is important to human society. Direct observations, used to measure magnetic fields, can only probe the magnetic fields in the photosphere and above, far from the regions the magnetic fields are being enhanced by the solar dynamo. Solar gamma rays produced by cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere have been detected from GeV to TeV energy range, and revealed that they are significantly affected by solar magnetic fields. However, much of the observations are yet to be explained by a physical model. Using a semi-analytic model, we show that magnetic fields at and below the photosphere with a large horizontal component could explain the $\sim$1 TeV solar gamma rays observed by HAWC. This could allow high-energy solar gamma rays to be a novel probe for magnetic fields below the photosphere.</description>

      <title>The host galaxy of low-luminosity compact sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The term 'active galactic nuclei' (AGN) subtends a huge variety of objects, classified on their properties at different wavelengths. Peaked sources (PS) represent a class of AGN at the first stage of evolution, characterised by a peaked radio spectrum. Among these radio sources, low-luminosity compact (LLC) sources can be identified as PS accreting with a high Eddington rate, harbouring low-power jets and hosting low-mass black holes. These properties are also shared by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). In 2016, LLCs were hypothesised to be the parent population of NLS1s with a flat radio spectrum (F-NLS1s), suggesting the former to be the same objects as the latter, seen at higher inclination. Based on radio luminosity functions and optical spectra analysis, 10 LLCs were identified as valid candidates for F-NLS1s. To account for the missing puzzle piece, verifying if these LLCs could be hosted in late-type galaxies as NLS1s, we performed the photometric decomposition of their Pan-STARRS1 images in all five filters. We used the 2D fitting algorithm GALFIT for the single-band analysis, and its extension GALFITM for the multi-band analysis. Considering that the morphological type and the structural parameters of the host can be dependent on the wavelength, we found six out of ten LLCs hosted in late-type galaxies, probably with pseudo-bulges, three point-like sources and one object of uncertain classification. Although this study is based on a small sample, it represents the first morphological analysis of LLC host galaxies. The results confirm the trend observed in NLS1s, indicating late-type/disc-like host galaxies for LLCs and supporting the validity of the parent population scenario.</description>

      <title>The Symbiotic X-ray Binary IGR J16194-2810: A Window on the Future Evolution of Wide Neutron Star Binaries From Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical follow-up of IGR J16194-2810, a hard X-ray source discovered by the INTEGRAL mission. The optical counterpart is a $\sim500\,L_\odot$ red giant at a distance of $2.1$ kpc. We measured 16 radial velocities (RVs) of the giant over a period of $\sim 300$ days. Fitting these RVs with a Keplerian model, we find an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb} = 192.73 \pm 0.01$ days and a companion mass function $f(M_2) = 0.361 \pm 0.005 \,M_{\odot}$. We detect ellipsoidal variability with the same period in optical light curves from the ASAS-SN survey. Joint fitting of the RVs, light curves, and the broadband SED allows us to robustly constrain the masses of both components. We find a giant mass of $M_\star = 1.02\pm 0.01\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{2} = 1.35^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\,M_{\odot}$, implying that the companion is a neutron star (NS). We recover a $4.06$-hour period in the system's TESS light curve, which we tentatively associate with the NS spin period. The giant does not yet fill its Roche lobe, suggesting that current mass transfer is primarily via winds. MESA evolutionary models predict that the giant will overflow its Roche lobe in $5$-$10$ Myr, eventually forming a recycled pulsar + white dwarf binary with a $\sim 900$ day period. IGR J16194-2810 provides a window on the future evolution of wide NS + main sequence binaries recently discovered via Gaia astrometry. As with those systems, the binary's formation history is uncertain. Before the formation of the NS, it likely survived a common envelope episode with a donor-to-accretor mass ratio $\gtrsim 10$ and emerged in a wide orbit. The NS likely formed with a weak kick ($v_{\rm kick}\lesssim 100\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$), as stronger kicks would have disrupted the orbit.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally produced Dark Matter and primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine how the existence of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) influences cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) for spin-0 and spin-1 particles. In addition to the known effects of particle production and entropy dilution resulting from PBH evaporation, we find that the generation of dark matter (DM) through CGPP is profoundly influenced by a possible era of PBH matter domination. This early matter dominated era results in an enhancement of the particle spectrum from CGPP. Specifically, it amplifies the peak comoving momentum $k_\star$ for spin-1 DM, while enhancing the plateau of the spectrum for minimally coupled spin-0 particles for low comoving momenta. At the same time, the large entropy dilution may partially or completely compensate for the increase of the spectrum and strongly mitigates the DM abundance produced by CGPP. Our results show that, in the computation of the final abundance, CGPP and PBH evaporation cannot be disentangled, but the parameters of both sectors must be considered together to obtain the final result. Furthermore, we explore the potential formation of PBHs from density fluctuations arising from CGPP and the associated challenges in such a scenario.</description>

      <title>From the Dawn of Neutrino Astronomy to A New View of the Extreme Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, neutrino astronomy has emerged as a new window into the extreme and hidden universe. Current generation experiments have detected high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin and identified the first sources, opening the field to discovery. Looking ahead, the authors of this Perspective identify seven major open questions in neutrino astrophysics and particle physics that could lead to transformative discoveries over the next 20 years. These multi-disciplinary questions range from understanding the vicinity of a black hole to unveiling the nature of neutrino mass, among other topics. Additionally, we critically review the current experimental capabilities and their limitations and, from there, discuss the interplay between different proposed neutrino telescope technologies and analysis techniques. The authors firmly believe that achieving the immense discovery potential over the next two decades demands a model of global partnership and complementary specialized detectors. This collaborative neutrino telescope network will pave the way for a thriving multi-messenger era, transforming our understanding of neutrino physics, astrophysics, and the extreme universe. \end{abstract}</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Mis-Classified as an Ellipsoidal Variable: Complications for Detached Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.</description>

Abstract: Using tremendous photon statistics gained with the stray light aperture of the NuSTAR telescope over 11 years of operation, we set strong limits on the emission of close to monochromatic photons from the radiative decays of putative dark matter sterile neutrinos in the Milky Way. In the energy range of 3-20 keV covered by the NuSTAR, the obtained limits reach the edge of theoretical predictions of realistic models leaving only a small room left to explore.</description>

      <title>The expected evolution of the binary system PTF J2238+743015.1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary systems made by a low-mass CO WD and a He-donor represent possible progenitors of explosive events via He-detonation, producing low-luminosity thermonuclear Supernovae with a peculiar nucleosynthetis. Recently, the binary system PTF J223857.11+743015.1 has been suggested as one. We investigate the evolution of the PTF J223857.11+743015.1 system, composed by a 0.75Msun CO WD and a 0.390Msun subdwarf, capped by a thin H-rich layer, considering rotation of the WD component. We compute the evolution of two stars simultaneously, accounting for the possible evolution of the orbital parameters, as determined by mass transfer between components and by mass ejection from the system during RLOF episodes. We consider that the WD gains angular momentum due to accretion and we follow the evolution of the angular velocity profile as due to angular momentum transport via convection and rotation-induced instabilities. As the donor H-rich envelope is transferred, the WD experiences recurrent very strong H-flashes triggering RLOF episodes during which the entire accreted matter is lost from the system. Due to mixing of chemicals by rotation-induced instabilities during the accretion phase, H-flashes occur inside the original WD. Hence, pulse-by pulse, the accretor mass is reduced down to 0.7453Msun. When He-rich matter is transferred, He-detonation does not occur in the rotating WD, which undergoes 6 very strong He-flashes and subsequent RLOF episodes. Also in this case, due to rotation-induced mixing of the accreted layers with the underlying core, the WD is eroded. Finally, when the mass transfer rate from the donor decreases, a massive He-buffer is piled-up onto the accretor which ends its life as a cooling WD. The binary system PTF J2238+743015.1 as all those binaries having similar components masses and orbital parameters are not good candidates as thermonuclear explosions progenitors.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of magnetohydrodynamic modes in the ISM through synchrotron polarization statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the biggest challenges in understanding Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is identifying the plasma mode components from observational data. Previous studies on synchrotron polarization from the interstellar medium (ISM) suggest that the dominant MHD modes can be identified via statistics of Stokes parameters, which would be crucial for studying various ISM processes such as the scattering and acceleration of cosmic rays, star formation, dynamo. In this paper, we present a numerical study of the Synchrotron Polarization Analysis (SPA) method through systematic investigation of the statistical properties of the Stokes parameters. We derive the theoretical basis for our method from the fundamental statistics of MHD turbulence, recognizing that the projection of the MHD modes allows us to identify the modes dominating the energy fraction from synchrotron observations. Based on the discovery, we revise the SPA method using synthetic synchrotron polarization observations obtained from 3D ideal MHD simulations with a wide range of plasma parameters and driving mechanisms, and present a modified recipe for mode identification. We propose a classification criterion based on a new SPA+ fitting procedure, which allows us to distinguish between Alfv\'en mode and compressible/slow mode dominated turbulence. We further propose a new method to identify fast modes by analyzing the asymmetry of the SPA+ signature and establish a new asymmetry parameter to detect the presence of fast mode turbulence. Additionally, we confirm through numerical tests that the identification of the compressible and fast modes is not affected by Faraday rotation in both the emitting plasma and the foreground.</description>

      <title>Strange quark stars: the role of excluded volume effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cold strange quark stars employing an enhanced version of the quark-mass density-dependent model which incorporates excluded volume effects to address non-perturbative QCD repulsive interactions. We provide a comparative analysis of our mass formula parametrization with previous models from the literature. We identify the regions within the parameter space where three-flavor quark matter is more stable than the most tightly bound atomic nucleus (stability window). Specifically, we show that excluded volume effects do not change the Gibbs free energy per baryon at zero pressure, rendering the stability window unaffected. The curves of pressure versus energy density exhibit various shapes -- convex upward, concave downward, or nearly linear -- depending on the mass parametrization. This behavior results in different patterns of increase, decrease, or constancy in the speed of sound as a function of baryon number density. We analyze the mass-radius relationship of strange quark stars, revealing a significant increase in maximum gravitational mass and a shift in the curves towards larger radii as the excluded volume effect intensifies. Excluded volume effects render our models compatible with all modern astrophysical constraints, including the properties of the recently observed low-mass compact object HESSJ1731.</description>

Abstract: Multi-messenger searches for BNS and NSBH mergers are currently one of the most exciting areas of astronomy. The search for joint electromagnetic and neutrino counterparts to GWs has resumed with O4. To support this effort, public semi-automated data products are sent in near real-time and include localization and source properties to guide complementary observations. In preparation for O4, we have conducted a study using a simulated population of compact binaries and a MDC in the form of a real-time replay to optimize and profile the software infrastructure and scientific deliverables. End-to-end performance was tested, including data ingestion, running online search pipelines, performing annotations, and issuing alerts to the astrophysics community. We present an overview of the low-latency infrastructure and the performance of the data products that are now being released during O4 based on the MDC. We report the expected median latency for the preliminary alert of full bandwidth searches (29.5s) and show consistency and accuracy of released data products using the MDC. For the first time, we report the expected median latency for triggers from early warning searches (-3.1s), which are new in O4 and target neutron star mergers during inspiral phase. This paper provides a performance overview for LVK low-latency alert infrastructure and data products using the MDC and serves as a useful reference for the interpretation of O4 detections.</description>

      <title>Evolution and final fate of massive post-common-envelope binaries</title>

Abstract: Mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) are nowadays observed routinely thanks to gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. In the isolated binary-evolution channel, a common-envelope (CE) phase of a red supergiant (RSG) and a compact object is crucial to sufficiently shrink the orbit and thereby enable a merger via GW emission. Here, we use the outcomes of two three-dimensional (3D) magneto-hydrodynamic CE simulations of an initially 10.0 solar-mass RSG with a 5.0 solar-mass BH and a 1.4 solar-mass NS, respectively, to explore the further evolution and final fate of the post-CE binaries. Notably, the 3D simulations reveal that the post-CE binaries are likely surrounded by circumbinary disks (CBDs), which contain substantial mass and angular momentum to influence the subsequent evolution. The binary systems in MESA modelling undergo another phase of mass transfer (MT) and we find that most donor stars do not explode in ultra-stripped supernovae (SNe), but rather in Type Ib/c SNe. The final orbits of our models with the BH companion are too wide, and NS kicks are actually required to sufficiently perturb the orbit and thus facilitate a merger via GW emission. Moreover, by exploring the influence of CBDs, we find that mass accretion from the disk widens the binary orbit, while CBD-binary resonant interactions can shrink the separation and increase the eccentricity depending on the disk mass and lifetime. Efficient resonant contractions may even enable a BH or NS to merge with the remnant He stars before a second SN explosion, which may be observed as gamma-ray burst-like transients, luminous fast blue optical transients and Thorne-\.Zytkow objects. For the surviving post-CE binaries, the CBD-binary interactions may significantly increase the GW-induced double compact merger fraction. We conclude that accounting for CBD may be crucial to better understand observed GW mergers.</description>

      <title>Tracking Supermassive Black Hole Mergers from kpc to sub-pc Scales with AXIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis showcasing how the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a proposed NASA Probe-class mission, will significantly increase our understanding of supermassive black holes undergoing mergers -- from kpc to sub-pc scales. In particular, the AXIS point spread function, field of view, and effective area are expected to result in (1) the detection of hundreds to thousands of new dual AGNs across the redshift range 0 &lt; z &lt; 5 and (2) blind searches for binary AGNs that are exhibiting merger signatures in their light curves and spectra. AXIS will detect some of the highest-redshift dual AGNs to date, over a large range of physical separations. The large sample of AGN pairs detected by AXIS (over a magnitude more than currently known) will result in the first X-ray study that quantifies the frequency of dual AGNs as a function of redshift up to z = 4.</description>

      <title>Insights into the physics of GRBs from the high-energy extension of their prompt emission spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the high-energy (MeV-GeV) part of GRBs spectrum can play a crucial role in investigating the physics of the prompt emission, but it is often hampered by low statistic and the paucity of GeV observations. In this work, we analyze the prompt emission spectra of the 22 brightest GRBs which have been simultaneously observed by Fermi/GBM and Fermi/LAT, spanning 6 orders of magnitude in energy. The high-energy photon spectra can be modelled with a power-law $N(E)\propto E^{-\beta}$ possibly featuring an exponential cutoff. We find that, with the inclusion of the LAT data, the spectral index $\beta$ is softer than what typically inferred from the analysis of Fermi/GBM data alone. Under the assumption that the emission is synchrotron, we derive the index $p\sim2.79$ of the power-law energy distribution of accelerated particles ($N(\gamma)\propto \gamma^{-p}$). In 9 out of 22 GRB spectra, we find a significant presence of an exponential cut-off at high-energy, ranging between 14 and 298 MeV. By interpreting the observed cut-off as a sign of pair-production opacity, we estimate the jet bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$, finding values in the range 130-330. These values are consistent with those inferred from the afterglow light curve onset time. Finally, by combining the information from the high-energy prompt emission spectrum with the afterglow lightcurve, we provide a method to derive the distance R from the central engine where the prompt emission occurs. These results highlight the importance of including high-energy data, when available, in the study of prompt spectra and their role in addressing the current challenges of the GRB standard model.</description>

      <title>A candidate coherent radio flash following a neutron star merger</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present rapid follow-up observations of the short GRB 201006A, consistent with being a compact binary merger, using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We have detected a candidate 5.6$\sigma$, short, coherent radio flash at 144 MHz at 76.6 mins post-GRB with a 3$\sigma$ duration of 38 seconds. This radio flash is 27 arcsec offset from the GRB location, which has a probability of occurring by chance of $\sim$0.05% (3.8$\sigma$) when accounting for measurement uncertainties. Despite the offset, we show that the probability of finding an unrelated transient within 40 arcsec of the GRB location is $&lt;10^{-6}$ and conclude that this is a candidate radio counterpart to GRB 201006A. We performed image plane dedispersion and the radio flash is tentatively (2.4$\sigma$) shown to be highly dispersed, allowing a distance estimate, corresponding to a redshift of $0.58\pm0.06$. The corresponding luminosity of the event at this distance is $6.7^{+6.6}_{-4.4} \times 10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. If associated with GRB 201006A, this emission would indicate prolonged activity from the central engine that is consistent with being a newborn, supramassive, likely highly magnetised, millisecond spin neutron star (a magnetar).</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Influence on Quarkyonic Stars: A Relativistic Mean Field Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formulation of quarkyonic matter consists of treating both quarks and nucleons as quasi-particles, where a cross-over transition occurs between the two phases. This work is based upon some of the early ideas of quark matter. It can satisfy the different observational constraints on the neutron star (NS), such as its maximum mass and the canonical radius. In addition, we put an extra component inside the NS known as Dark Matter (DM) because it is trapped due to its immense gravitational potential. In this work, we explore the impact of fermionic DM on the structure of the NS. The equation of state (EOS) is derived for the NS with the quarkyonic matter by assuming that nucleons and quarks are in equilibrium, followed by the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism. The recently modeled two parameterizations, such as G3 and IOPB-I, are taken to calculate the various macroscopic properties of the NS. The three unknown parameters such as the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($\Lambda_{\rm sc}$), and the DM Fermi momentum ($k_f^{\rm DM}$) are varied to obtain the NS properties. The quarkyonic matter stiffens the EOS while DM softens it. The mutual combination provides us with good theoretical predictions for the magnitude of macroscopic properties consistent with the different observational results. Also, one can estimate the parameters of the DM admixed quarkyonic star with different statistical analyses, which can be further used to explore the other properties of the quarkyonic star.</description>

      <title>Observation of spectral lines in the exceptional GRB 221009A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the brightest gamma-ray burst ever observed, GRB 221009A provided a precious opportunity to explore spectral line features. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive spectroscopy analysis of GRB 221009A jointly with GECAM-C and Fermi/GBM data to search for emission and absorption lines. For the first time we investigated the line feature throughout this GRB including the most bright part where many instruments suffered problems, and identified prominent emission lines in multiple time intervals. The central energy of the Gaussian emission line evolves from about 37 MeV to 6 MeV, with a nearly constant ratio (about 10\%) between the line width and central energy. Particularly, we find that both the central energy and the energy flux of the emission line evolve with time as a power law decay with power law index of -1 and -2 respectively. We suggest that the observed emission lines most likely originate from the blue-shifted electron positron pair annihilation 511 keV line. We find that a standard high latitude emission scenario cannot fully interpret the observation, thus we propose that the emission line comes from some dense clumps with electron positron pairs traveling together with the jet. In this scenario, we can use the emission line to directly, for the first time, measure the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet ($\Gamma$) and reveal its time evolution (i.e. $\Gamma \sim t^{-1}$) during the prompt emission. Interestingly, we find that the flux of the annihilation line in the co-moving frame keeps constant. These discoveries of the spectral line features shed new and important lights on the physics of GRB and relativistic jet.</description>

      <title>Finding the Particularity of the Active Episode of SGR J1935+2154 during Which FRB 20200428 Occurred: Implication from Statistics of Fermi/GBM X-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical (SOC) system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the FRB episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the fast radio burst (FRB) emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfven waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Neutrino Gravitational Wave Memory from Core-Collapse Supernovae using the Moon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the milestone of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from merging compact binaries, the next significant watershed moment in GW astronomy lies in detecting GWs from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). In this Letter, I describe the possibility of detecting the GW linear memory -- a phenomenon resulting from a combination of aspherical matter ejection and anisotropic neutrino emission during stellar collapse -- using GW detectors on the Moon. This would grant unprecedented access to the sub-Hz/Hz GW frequency range, which is inaccessible to both current and future terrestrial GW detectors. I demonstrate that three-dimensional CCSNe GW waveforms may be detectable by both seismometer and interferometeric lunar GW detectors, with the latter design proposal extending 10 kpc to megaparsec detection distances.</description>

      <title>Robust constraints on feebly interacting particles using XMM-Newton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During galactic Supernova (SN) explosions, a large amount of feebly interacting particles (FIPs) may be produced. In this work we analyze electrophilic FIPs with masses in the MeV-range that escape from SN and decay into electron-positron pairs, causing an exotic leptonic injection. This contribution adds up to known components, leading to an unexpected excess of X-ray fluxes generated by inverse-Compton scattering of the injected particles on low-energy photon backgrounds. For the first time in the context of FIPs, we use XMM-Newton X-ray measurements to obtain the strongest and most robust bounds on electrophilic FIPs produced by SN in our Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study MeV-scale electrophilic Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs), that may be abundantly produced in Supernova (SN) explosions, escape the star and decay into electrons and positrons. This exotic injection of leptons in the Milky Way leaves an imprint in both photon and cosmic-ray fluxes. Specifically, positrons lose energy and annihilate almost at rest with background electrons, producing photons with $511$ keV energy. In addition, electrons and positrons radiate photons through bremsstrahlung emission and upscatter the low-energy galactic photon fields via the inverse Compton process generating a broad emission from X-ray to $\gamma$-ray energies. Finally, electrons and positrons are directly observable in cosmic ray experiments. In order to describe the FIP-induced lepton injection in full generality, we use a model independent parametrization which can be applied to a host of FIPs such as axion-like particles, dark photons and sterile neutrinos. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data to robustly constrain FIP-electron interactions with an innovative multimessenger analysis.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of a silicon-based 6U Cubesat detector for soft $\gamma$-ray astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of the low-energy $\gamma$-ray (0.1-30 MeV) sky has been significantly limited since the COMPTEL instrument was decommissioned aboard the Compton Gamma-ray Observer (CGRO) satellite in 2000. The exploration of $\gamma$-ray photons within this energy band, often referred to as the \say{MeV gap}, is crucial to address numerous unresolved mysteries in high-energy and multi-messenger astrophysics. Although several large MeV $\gamma$-ray missions have been proposed (e.g., e-ASTROGAM, AMEGO, COSI), most of these are in the planning phase, with launches not expected until the next decade, at the earliest. Recently, there has been a surge in proposed CubeSat missions as cost-effective and rapidly implementable \say{pathfinder} alternatives. A MeV CubeSat payload dedicated to $\gamma$-ray astronomy could serve as a valuable demonstrator for large-scale future MeV payloads. This paper proposes a $\gamma$-ray payload design with a Silicon-based tracker and a Ceasium-Iodide-based calorimeter. We report the results of a simulation study to assess the performance of this payload concept and compare the results with those of previous $\gamma$-ray instruments. As part of the performance assessment and comparison, we show that with our proposed payload design, a sensitivity better than IBIS can be achieved for energies between 0.1 and 10 MeV, and for energies up to around 1 MeV, the achieved sensitivity is comparable to COMPTEL, therefore opening up a window towards cost-effective observational astronomy with comparable performance to past missions.</description>

      <title>Effects on neutrino propagation in space-time foam of D-branes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos from the cosmos have proven to be ideal for probing the nature of space-time. Previous studies on high-energy events of IceCube suggested that some of these events might be gamma-ray burst neutrinos, with their speeds varying linearly with their energy, implying also the coexistence of subluminal and superluminal propagation. However, a recent reanalysis of the data, incorporating revised directional information, reveals stronger signals that neutrinos are actually being slowed down compared to previous suggestion of neutrino speed variation. Thus, it is worth discussing its implications for the brane/string inspired framework of space-time foam, which has been used to explain previous observations. We revisit effects on neutrino propagation from specific foam models within the framework, indicating that the implied violation of Lorentz invariance could necessarily cause the neutrino to decelerate. We therefore argue that this sort of model is in agreement with the updated phenomenological indication just mentioned. An extended analysis of the revised IceCube data will further test these observations and stringy quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Membrane Paradigm Approach to the Johannsen-Psaltis Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Johannsen-Psaltis (JP) black hole is a phenomenologically viable metric obtained by judiciously deforming the Kerr black hole such that the metric is asymptotically flat and causal and is consistent with the weak field, post-Newtonian tests of gravity; however, it has additional hairs besides its mass and angular momentum. As it deviates from the Kerr black hole in the strong coupling regime, it is a useful metric to test the Kerr hypothesis that states that all astrophysical black holes are of the Kerr type. Here we give a membrane description of this black hole that effectively amounts to replacing the observable part of the black hole with a fluid with thermal properties. A timelike membrane, a stretched horizon local in time is assumed to exist. This membrane is expected to approximate the null event horizon that is highly non-local in time. We derive the energy-momentum tensor of the fluid and all the transport coefficients using the action formulation to the membrane as advocated by Parikh and Wilczek. In the fluid description, one observes that the finiteness of the transport coefficients constrains the additional hairs of the Johannsen-Psaltis black hole. Analytically continuing the pressure of the fluid to all values of the radial coordinate $r$, one obtains interesting Van der Waals-type behavior of the pressure of the fluid which diverges at the radius of the outer ergosphere, lending support, from the membrane paradigm's perspective to the claim that relativistic astrophysical jets are produced by the ergoregion of the black hole.</description>
