      <title>The Twisted Spin Synchrotron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A "Figure 8" shaped synchrotron is suggested for use in accelerating polarized protons in the energy range below ~ 20 GeV. The spin tune in such an accelerator does not ramp with energy and is equal to zero . Then the intrinsic spin resonances will not appear. A partial Siberian snake (solenoid) is proposed to be inserted into the ring in order to stabilize the spin against imperfect horizontal magnetic fields and implicate a small constant spin tune. The equilibrium polarization will then be horizontal (longitudinal in the solenoid). The twisted spin synchrotron (TSS) can serve as a booster for high energy accelerators with polarized beams. Possibilities to use the TSS as a storage facility or a collider for proton or other particle beams with readily controlled beam polarization are also noted.</description>

      <title>Frequency splitting in undulator radiation from solid-state crystalline undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of frequencies and angular properties of radiation emitted from a solid-state crystalline undulator based on the channeling effect are considered. High-frequency and low-frequency branches of the undulator radiation and the angular distribution of the emitted radiation are analyzed. The ranges of frequencies and angles of radiation emitted from the solid-state crystalline undulator based on the channeling effect are found. The frequency splitting and the energy threshold in the production of undulator radiation are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Representation of fields in inhomogeneous structured waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of a study of the possibility of using a homogeneous basis and a new generalization of coupled modes theory to describe non-periodic structured waveguides. It was shown that for the studied inhomogeneities the single wave approximation gives good results. Within the framework of single wave approximation, the fields are represented as the sum of two components, one of which is associated with the forward eigen wave, and the second with the backward eigen wave. But this second component is not a backward wave. Because of the coupling, characteristics of this component are determined by the first component, which is significantly larger than the second.</description>

      <title>Maximal quantum interaction between free electrons and photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of free-electron quantum optics enables electron-photon entanglement and holds the potential for generating nontrivial photon states for quantum information processing. Although recent experimental studies have entered the quantum regime, rapid theoretical developments predict that qualitatively unique phenomena only emerge beyond a certain interaction strength. It is thus pertinent to identify the maximal electron-photon interaction strength and the materials, geometries, and particle energies that enable one to approach it. We derive an upper limit to the quantum vacuum interaction strength between free electrons and single-mode photons, which illuminates the conditions for the strongest interaction. Crucially, we obtain an explicit energy selection recipe for electrons and photons to achieve maximal interaction at arbitrary separations and identify two optimal regimes favoring either fast or slow electrons over those with intermediate velocities. We validate the limit by analytical and numerical calculations on canonical geometries and provide near-optimal designs indicating the feasibility of strong quantum interactions. Our findings offer fundamental intuition for maximizing the quantum interaction between free electrons and photons and provide practical design rules for future experiments on electron-photon and electron-mediated photon-photon entanglement. They should also enable the evaluation of key metrics for applications such as the maximum power of free-electron radiation sources and the maximum acceleration gradient of dielectric laser accelerators.</description>
