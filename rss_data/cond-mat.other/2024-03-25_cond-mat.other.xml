      <title>Performing Non-Local Phase Estimation with a Rydberg-Superconducting Qubit Hybrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computation is the key to high volume computation in the NISQ era. This investigation explores the key aspects necessary for the construction of a quantum network by numerically simulating the execution of the distributed phase estimation algorithm in a proposed novel superconducting-resonator-atom hybrid system. The phase estimation algorithm is used to estimate the phase or eigenvalue of a given unitary operator and is a sub-process of many other known quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm and the quantum counting algorithm . An entangling gate between two qubits is utilised in the distributed phase estimation algorithm, called an E2 gate which provides the possibility to transfer quantum information from one quantum computer to another, which was numerically shown to have a construction time of 17ns at a fidelity of 93%. This investigation analytically derives the Hamiltonian dynamics as well as the noise sources of each system and utilizes quantum optimal control (QOC), namely the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm, to minimize fidelity error in the corresponding systems gate construction. The GRAPE algorithm showed very accurate engineering of Rydberg atom single and multi-qubit gates with fidelities higher than 90% while the flux qubit suffered greatly from noise with multi-qubit gate fidelities lower than 90%. The C-shunt factor was shown to decrease the noise of the flux qubit which in turn increased the probability of accurately estimating the phase using 4 counting qubits. A trade off was observed between the number of time steps in the descent/ascent and the number of GRAPE iterations ran on the optimisation for low C-shunt factors $0&lt;\zeta&lt;1000$. For $\zeta = 1000$, the GRAPE algorithm showed effectiveness for a large number of time steps and large amount of GRAPE iterations by reaching estimation accuracies greater than 90%.</description>

      <title>Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Bound States in the Continuum in InSb nanowire networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are exotic, localized states even though their energy lies in the continuum spectra. Since its discovery in 1929, the quest to unveil these exotic states in charge transport experiments remains an active pursuit in condensed matter physics. Here, we study charge transport in InSb nanowire networks in the ballistic regime and subject to a perpendicular magnetic field as ideal candidates to observe and control the appearance of BICs. We find that BICs reveal themselves as distinctive resonances or antiresonances in the conductance by varying the applied magnetic field and the Fermi energy. We systematically consider different lead connections in hashtag-like nanowire networks, finding the optimal configuration that enhances the features associated with the emergence of BICs. Finally, the investigation focuses on the effect of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction of InSb on the occurrence of BICs in nanowire networks. While the interaction generally plays a detrimental role in the signatures of the BICs in the conductance of the nanowire networks, it opens the possibility to operate these nanostructures as spin filters for spintronics. We believe that this work could pave the way for the unambiguous observation of BICs in charge transport experiments and for the development of advanced spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Single-layer of Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ grown on Ag(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report the growth of a single mixed Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$ layer, with diverse stoichiometries, on a Ag(111) substrate. The atomic geometry has been thoroughly investigated by low energy electron diffraction, scanning tunneling microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments, as well as calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). We first determined that both pure systems (Bi/Ag(111) and Sb/Ag(111)) show similar behaviors: they form surface alloys with ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$)R30$^\circ$ periodicity for coverages lower than 1/3 ML, and undergo a dealloying transition for higher coverages up to 2/3 ML. We then established a simple preparation procedure to obtain a mixed Bi-Sb overlayer on Ag(111): it is essential to start with a surface completely covered by either of the two pure surface alloys and then deposit the other element on it. The energetics derived from DFT calculations provide insight into the systems preference towards the formation of this phase, and also predict a pathway to the formation of Bi-rich non-alloyed phases. The obtained mixed Bi-Sb phase has a lateral atomic arrangement very similar to the one in the non-alloyed phase observed for Sb on Ag(111), with Sb and Bi atoms distributed disorderly, and presents a significant vertical corrugation, promising considerable Rashba effects.</description>

      <title>Novel Dipole-Lattice coupling in the Quantum-Spin-Liquid Material $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of molecular Mott insulators on triangular lattice provided a few S=1/2 triangular quantum spin liquid candidates, with $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$Cu$_2$(CN)$_3$ being the most studied material of this group. The large number experimental works present a conflicting set of evidence, with some suggesting spin liquid behavior, while others point towards a valence bond solid with orphan spins. In this work we use Raman scattering spectroscopy to probe both local charge on molecular sites and lattice phonons as a function of temperature down to 6~K. Based on the analysis of the line shape of the BEDT-TTF charge sensitive vibration $\nu_2$ on cooling below 40 K, we suggest a development of disordered fluctuating charge disproportionation on (BEDT-TTF)$_2$ dimers of amplitude as small as 0.06$e$. The lattice phonons show strong anomalous broadening on cooling only in the (c,c) scattering channel, associated with the developing charge disproportionation. We suggest an interpretation, where the coupling of disordered charge dipoles on dimers to the lattice results in anisotropic modulation of charge transfer integrals between dimer lattice sites. Such fluctuations would result in modulation of magnetic coupling between spins which can produce fluctuating charge ordered spin-singlet pairs.</description>

      <title>Classical action for the height within the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we write down a classical (not quantum) action for the surface height for the Kardar-Parizi-Zhang (KPZ) equation for surface growth. We dos so starting with the regular Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) action and integrate out the quantum constraint field. We analyze the classical action within the gaussian and one loop approximations and find various instabilities to rough surfaces. The gaussian analysis predicts instabilities to rough surfaces below 2d while one loop predicts stronger surface stability to roughness and instabilities to roughness below 1d rather then 2d. In the supplement we also modify the KPZ equation for growing surfaces to include the effect of surface tilton the noise (that is have multiplicatively coupled noise).</description>
