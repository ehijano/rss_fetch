      <title>Combinatorial Optimization with Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to do computation with a potential advantage over classical computers. While a single classical computer transforms one particular binary input into an output after applying one operator to the input, a quantum computer can apply the operator to a superposition of binary strings to provide a superposition of binary outputs, doing computation apparently in parallel. This feature allows quantum computers to speed up the computation compared to classical algorithms. Unsurprisingly, quantum algorithms have been proposed to solve optimization problems in quantum computers. Furthermore, a family of quantum machines called quantum annealers are specially designed to solve optimization problems. In this paper, we provide an introduction to quantum optimization from a practical point of view. We introduce the reader to the use of quantum annealers and quantum gate-based machines to solve optimization problems.</description>

      <title>IMPLY-based Approximate Full Adders for Efficient Arithmetic Operations in Image Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the performance limitations in modern computing, such as the power wall, emerging computing paradigms are gaining increasing importance. Approximate computing offers a promising solution by substantially enhancing energy efficiency and reducing latency, albeit with a trade-off in accuracy. Another emerging method is memristor-based In-Memory Computing (IMC) which has the potential to overcome the Von Neumann bottleneck. In this work, we combine these two approaches and propose two Serial APProximate IMPLY-based full adders (SAPPI). When embedded in a Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), our designs reduce the number of steps by 39%-41% and the energy consumption by 39%-42% compared to the exact algorithm. We evaluated our approach at the circuit level and compared it with State-of-the-Art (SoA) approximations where our adders improved the speed by up to 10% and the energy efficiency by up to 13%. We applied our designs in three common image processing applications where we achieved acceptable image quality with up to half of the RCA approximated.
  We performed a case study to demonstrate the applicability of our approximations in Machine Learning (ML) underscoring the potential gains in more complex scenarios. The proposed approach demonstrates energy savings of up to 296 mJ (21%) and a reduction of 1.3 billion (20%) computational steps when applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>TinyLLM: A Framework for Training and Deploying Language Models at the Edge Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language models have gained significant interest due to their general-purpose capabilities, which appear to emerge as models are scaled to increasingly larger parameter sizes. However, these large models impose stringent requirements on computing systems, necessitating significant memory and processing requirements for inference. This makes performing inference on mobile and edge devices challenging, often requiring invocating remotely-hosted models via network calls. Remote inference, in turn, introduces issues like latency, unreliable network connectivity, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we explored the possibility of deviating from the trend of increasing model size. Instead, we hypothesize that much smaller models (~30-120M parameters) can outperform their larger counterparts for specific tasks by carefully curating the data used for pre-training and fine-tuning. We investigate this within the context of deploying edge-device models to support sensing applications. We trained several foundational models through a systematic study and found that small models can run locally on edge devices, achieving high token rates and accuracy. Based on these findings, we developed a framework that allows users to train foundational models tailored to their specific applications and deploy them at the edge.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bootstrapping, Autonomous Testing, and Initialization System for Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) devices have become central to advancements in spin-based quantum computing. As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.</description>

      <title>Future Aspects in Human Action Recognition: Exploring Emerging Techniques and Ethical Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-based human action recognition can be found in various application fields, e.g., surveillance systems, sports analytics, medical assistive technologies, or human-robot interaction frameworks, and it concerns the identification and classification of individuals' activities within a video. Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.</description>

      <title>Towards an identity management solution on Arweave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional identity management systems, often centralized, face challenges around privacy, data security, and user control, leaving users vulnerable to data breaches and misuse. This paper explores the potential of using the Arweave network to develop an identity management solution. By harnessing Arweave's permanent storage, our solution offers the users a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) framework, that uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to allow individuals and other entities to create, own, and manage their digital identities. Further, the solution integrates privacy-preserving technologies, including zero-knowledge proofs and the BBS(+) signature scheme, enabling selective disclosure. This approach ultimately enhances user privacy and supports compliance with European Union legislation and regulatory standards like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by design.</description>
