      <title>Gamow-Teller strength distributions of 18O and well-deformed nuclei 24,26Mg by deformed QRPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Gamow-Teller (GT) transition strength distributions of {strongly} deformed nuclei, $^{24,26}$Mg, as well as of $^{18}$O. The calculations are performed within a deformed quasi-particle random phase approximation (DQRPA) which explicitly includes the deformation degree of freedom in the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) and RPA calculations. The residual particle-particle ($p-p$) interaction as well as the particle-hole ($p-h$) interaction are extracted from Br\"uckner $G$-matrix calculations. The {residual interaction} dependence of the low-lying GT strength of these strongly deformed nuclei is examined by changing the strength of the residual $p-p$ and $p-h$ interactions.
  We have found that the low-lying GT peaks are quite similar in energy to those found in {spherical} $N=Z$ and $N=Z+2$ nuclei near magic shells, but the configurations {of $^{24,26}$Mg are largely mixed by} the pairing correlations and the deformation. Our results are compared to the experimental GT $(\pm)$ transition data by ($t$, $^3$He) and ($^{3}$He, $t$) reactions, {and found to reproduce the main features of GT strength distributions.</description>

      <title>Significance of the refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process in the ($p$,$pd$) reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton-induced deuteron knockout reaction, ($p$,$pd$), is one of the interests in the studies for probing the deuteron-like $p$-$n$ correlation in nuclei. According to a recent study of the inclusive deuteron-induced reaction, $(d,d'x)$, the refraction effect of the deuteron has a significant effect on the elementary process, nucleon-deuteron ($N$-$d$) binary scattering inside a nucleus, of the reaction. In the paper, it is shown that proper treatment of the local $N$-$d$ relative momentum in the elementary process is crucial in $(d,d'x)$ reactions at $100$ MeV and below. In the present work, we investigate the deuteron refraction effect in the exclusive ($p$,$pd$) reactions. We also discuss the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. The refraction effect on the $p$-$d$ elementary process is taken into account by the local semiclassical approximation to the distorted waves. The results are compared with those obtained with the asymptotic momentum approximation, which is standardly applied to the distorted wave impulse approximation framework. %The $(p,pd)$ cross sections at 101.3 MeV and 250 MeV are studied to see the incident energy dependence of the refraction effect. It is shown that the refraction effect drastically changes the energy sharing distribution of the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and gives a better agreement with experimental data. In contrast, it is confirmed that the effect is negligibly small at 250 MeV. We have clarified that the deuteron refraction effect is significant in the $^{16}$O($p$,$pd$)$^{14}$N reaction at 101.3 MeV and the experimental data are well reproduced. The refraction effect plays a significant role in both the shape and magnitude of the ($p$,$pd$) cross section, while the effect is negligible at 250 MeV.</description>

      <title>Target normal single-spin asymmetry in inclusive electron-nucleon scattering in the 1/Nc expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The target normal single-spin asymmetry in electron nucleon scattering is studied in the framework of the 1/Nc expansion of QCD, which allows for a rigorous description in the energy range that includes the Delta resonance and below the second baryon resonance region. The asymmetry is driven by the absorptive part of the two-photon exchange component of the scattering amplitude, being therefore the most unambiguous two-photon exchange effect. Such amplitude is shown to be described up to the next to leading order in the 1/Nc expansion only in terms of the charge and magnetic form factors of the nucleons, consequence of the approximate $SU(4)$ spin flavor symmetry valid in the large Nc limit for baryons. A discussion is provided of the 1/Nc expansion framework along with the results for the asymmetries in elastic, inelastic, and inclusive electron-nucleon scattering.</description>

      <title>Nuclear uncertainties associated with the ejecta of a neutron-star black-hole accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of heavy element nucleosynthesis requires input from yet-to-be-measured nuclear properties. The uncertainty in the values of these off-stability nuclear properties propagates to uncertainties in the predictions of elemental and isotopic abundances. However, for any given astrophysical explosion, there are many different trajectories, i.e. temperature and density histories, experienced by outflowing material and thus different nuclear properties can come into play. We consider combined nucleosynthesis results from 460,000 trajectories from a neutron star-black hole accretion disk and the find spread in elemental predictions due solely to unknown nuclear properties to be a factor of a few. We analyze this relative spread in model predictions due to nuclear variations and conclude that the uncertainties can be attributed to a combination of properties in a given region of the abundance pattern. We calculate a cross-correlation between mass changes and abundance changes to show how variations among the properties of participating nuclei may be explored. Our results provide further impetus for measurements of multiple quantities on individual short-lived neutron-rich isotopes at modern experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Photo-production of $\eta_{c,b}$ near Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the photo-production of $\eta_{c,b}$ off a proton in the threshold region, in terms of C-odd gluonic correlations in the off-forward proton matrix element. Near threshold, the skewness is large leading to a production amplitude that is dominated by four C-odd twist-3 gluon GPDs. We use the QCD instanton vacuum to estimate these C-odd contributions in the proton. The results are used to estimate the differential cross sections for coherent photo-production of $\eta_{c,b}$ in the threshold region, at current electron facilities.</description>

      <title>Maximal mass of the neutron star with a deconfined quark core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of equation of state for the matter in the neutron star plays an important role in determining its maximal mass. In addition, it must comply with the condition of causality. Noting that the central density of a maximally massive neutron star is well above the nuclear saturation density, a deconfined quark core in the central region is motivated in this paper. We analyze this scenario by employing the MIT bag model to represent the core region and one of the unified equations of state for the region outside the core. Such combination is found to solve the problem of causality violation. In each case of the combined equations of state, the radial profile of $\rho r^2$ displays a peak and dominant contribution to the total mass of the star comes from the region around the peak value of $\rho r^2$, whereas the contribution is small from the regions near the center and the surface. This peak occurs in the region of hadronic matter for the combinations considered in this paper. Importantly, we find that the position of the peak in $\rho r^2$ is well-correlated with the maximal mass -- the highest value of $1.98\ M_\odot$ obtains for the case with the peak occurring farthest from the center. This gravitational threshold being obtained for a non-rotating neutron star, we expect the threshold to lie well above 2 $ M_\odot$ for a rapidly rotating neutron star, that may explain the existance of massive pulsars from recent astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Unified equations of state for cold nonaccreting neutron stars with Brussels-Montreal functionals. V. Improved parametrization of the nucleon density distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We previously studied the inner crust and the pasta mantle of a neutron star within the 4th-order extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF) approach with consistent proton shell corrections added perturbatively via the Strutinsky integral (SI) theorem together with the contribution due to pairing. To speed up the computations and avoid numerical problems, we adopted parametrized nucleon density distributions. However, the errors incurred by the choice of the parametrization are expected to become more significant as the mean baryon number density is increased, especially in the pasta mantle where the differences in the energy per nucleon of the different phases are very small, typically a few keV. To improve the description of these exotic structures, we discuss the important features that a nuclear profile should fulfill and introduce two new parametrizations. Performing calculations using the BSk24 functional, we find that these parametrizations lead to lower ETF energy solutions for all pasta phases than the parametrization we adopted before and more accurately reproduce the exact equilibrium nucleon density distributions obtained from unconstrained variational calculations. Within the ETFSI method, all parametrizations predict the same composition in the region with quasi-spherical clusters. However, the two new parametrizations lead to a different mantle structure at mean baryon densities above about 0.07 fm^-3, at which point lasagna is energetically favored. Interestingly, spherical clusters reappear in the pasta region. The inverted pasta phases such as bucatini and Swiss cheese are still found in the densest region above the core in all cases.</description>

      <title>Strangeness $+1$ light multiquark baryons: a jinx?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the renewing experimental interest for searching strangeness $+1$ baryons at J-PARC, we study the existence of light baryon resonances with strangeness +1 generated in the $K$-$(N^*/\Delta^*)$ system, where $N^*$ represents either $N^*(1535)$/$N^*(1650)$/$N^*(1700)$, and $\Delta^*$ corresponds to $\Delta(1620)$. The description of the properties of the aforementioned states requires considering the dynamics involved in the coupled pseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon systems with strangeness $S=0$ in the s-wave. For the purpose of our current study, we consider the pseudoscalar-baryon (PB) and vector-baryon channels (VB) to which the mentioned $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances couple and solve the Faddeev equations for the coupled channel system $K$-$\text{PB}$, $K$-$\text{VB}$, with all interactions being in the s-wave. Despite some strong attraction present in two of the subsystems, we do not find clear evidence supporting the formation of strangeness +1 states, with spin-parity $J^P=1/2^+$, in the energy region $2000-2200$ MeV. However, the case of spin-parity $J^P=3/2^+$ seems more promising, showing the formation of a resonance with a mass around 2167 MeV, with a width of 90-100 MeV. We suggest that a signal of such a state could be found in processes with final states like $KN$, $K^*(892) N$.</description>

      <title>Jet angularities in dijet production in proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions at RHIC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study jet angularities for dijet production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in proton-proton (pp) and nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions at 200 GeV nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass collision energy. In particular, we provide $\mathrm{NLL}$ resummed predictions for angularity observables of groomed and ungroomed jets produced in $\rm pp$ collisions matched to next-to-leading order QCD calculations resulting in $\mathrm{NLO+NLL^\prime}$ accuracy. Our parton-level predictions are corrected for non-perturbative effects, such as hadronization and underlying event, using parton-to-hadron level transfer matrices obtained with the Sherpa event generator. Furthermore, we use the Q-Pythia and JEWEL generators to estimate the impact of the interaction between quarks and gluons produced by the parton shower with the dense medium formed in heavy-ion collisions on the considered jet angularities.</description>

      <title>Energy and Angle Dependence of Neutrino Scattering Rates in Proto-Neutron Star and Supernova Matter within Skyrme RPA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernova explosions are the most powerful neutrino sources. The neutrino emission is also the dominating cooling mechanism for a proto-neutron star, whose interior is mainly composed of extremely dense and hot nuclear matter. Neutrino transport is an essential part of the simulation of these phenomena, and modern codes are able to implement inelastic neutrino scattering and also to some extent its angle distribution. We therefore study the energy and angle dependence of neutrino scattering rates in proto-neutron star and supernova matter with the full Skyrme RPA response functions. We confirm earlier findings obtained in the Landau approximation that the RPA reduces neutrino scattering, but the detailed differential scattering rates in hot and dense matter depend sensitively on the adopted interaction. The scattering angle distribution is different for different interactions because it depends strongly on the neutron Fermi velocity. We also find that many Skyrme interactions present an unphysical feature that the Fermi velocity of neutrons exceeds the speed of light already at relatively low densities.</description>

Abstract: We examine the $\Lambda$-${}^4\mathrm{He}$ ($\alpha$) momentum correlation in high-energy collisions to elucidate the interaction between Lambdas ($\Lambda$) and nucleons ($N$). We compare phenomenological $\Lambda\alpha$ potentials with different strength at short range. In addition to the conventional Gaussian type potentials, we construct the $\Lambda\alpha$ potentials by substituting the nucleon density distribution of $\alpha$ in the Skyrme-type $\Lambda$ potentials. We find that the dependence on the employed potential models is visible in the correlation functions from a small size source. This indicates that the $\Lambda\alpha$ momentum correlation could constrain the property of the $\Lambda N$ interaction at high densities, which is expected to play an essential role in dense nuclear matter. Also, we verify that the Lednicky-Lyuboshits formula can yield erroneous results for a small source size with a potential which has large interaction range, like the $\Lambda\alpha$ system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) strongly influence the spectral properties of collective many-body quantum systems, changing degeneracy patterns in different quantum phases. Level degeneracies, in turn, affect the system's dynamics. We analyze the degeneracy dependence on the size of two-level boson models with a $u(n+1)$ dynamical algebra, where $n$ is the number of collective degrees of freedom. Below the ESQPT critical energy of these models, the energy gap between neighboring levels that belong to different symmetry sectors gets close to zero as the system size increases. We report and explain why this gap goes to zero exponentially for systems with one collective degree of freedom, but algebraically in models with more than one degree of freedom. As a consequence, we show that the infinite-time average of out-of-time-order correlators is an ESQPT order parameter in finite systems with $n=1$, but in systems with $n&gt;1$, this average only works as an order parameter in the mean-field limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent open quantum system studies showed that quarkonium time evolution inside the quark-gluon plasma is determined by transport coefficients that are defined in terms of a gauge invariant correlator of two chromoelectric field operators connected by an adjoint Wilson line. We study the Euclidean version of the correlator for quarkonium evolution and discuss the extraction of the transport coefficients from this Euclidean correlator, highlighting its difference from other problems that also require reconstructing a spectral function, such as the calculation of the heavy quark diffusion coefficient. Along the way, we explain why the transport coefficient $\gamma_{\rm adj}$ differs from $\gamma_{\rm fund}$ at finite temperature at $\mathcal{O}(g^4)$, in spite of the fact that their corresponding spectral functions differ only by a temperature-independent term at the same order. We then discuss how to evaluate the Euclidean correlator via lattice QCD methods, with a focus on reducing the uncertainty caused by infrared renormalons in determining the renormalization factor nonperturbatively.</description>

Abstract: Color flux tubes are a standard perspective from which to understand stopping in high-energy collisions. Mechanisms for baryon transport and polarization within a tube are considered here, both in regards to the the transport of baryons from the target and projectile toward mid-rapidity, and in regards to the correlations of baryon-antibaryon pairs created in the tube. The roles of tube merging and gluon radiation with a tube are emphasized.</description>

      <title>A Possible Solution to the Difficulty in the Interpretation of Deuteron Compositeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the theoretical structure of compositeness with explicit energy dependence, and find a possible explanation for the difficulty in the interpretation of compositeness of deuteron. Compositeness of deuteron is calculated as larger than one in many methods like weak-binding limit. Even though it is widely assumed that the energy dependence in interaction always comes from other states, which we call surjective interpretation, we find that the outcome of deuteron may suggest a violation of surjective interpretation. We directly perform numerical and perturbative calculations of deuteron compositeness. It is concluded that if the energy dependent part of interaction contributes to attraction, compositeness is likely to be enhanced from unity. We discuss the indications of this outcome and the model dependence of compositeness. We propose a straightforward extension and a thorough revise on the formalism of compositeness with field theory considerations.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the contribution of gluons to single inclusive hadron production at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small $x$ using the Color Glass Condensate formalism. It is shown that the only divergence present is the standard collinear divergence which is absorbed into evolution of gluon-hadron fragmentation function. Our calculations are performed at finite $N_c$ and we provide general finite $N_c$ expressions for the structure of Wilson lines appearing in inclusive dihadron and single hadron production cross sections. We also comment on how one can obtain rapidity distribution of hadron multiplicities from our results.</description>
