      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Asset Allocation Using DDPG with TiDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets. Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further exploration.</description>

      <title>QTMRL: An Agent for Quantitative Trading Decision-Making Based on Multi-Indicator Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23 years of S&amp;P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9 baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenJiahaoJNU/QTMRL.git</description>
