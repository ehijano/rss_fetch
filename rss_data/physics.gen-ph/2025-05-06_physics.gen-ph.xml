      <title>On the new way of symmetry breaking in scalar QED and the one-loop renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that single real scalar field does not allow gauge coupling to the Abelian vector field. Using the complex scalar model as a starting point, we construct the Abelian gauge model with two real scalars. The gauge transformations for the scalars look different (albeit equivalent) from the conventional sQED. Spitting the masses of the scalars, or the scalar self-couplings, or the nonminimal parameters of scalar-curvature interaction, we arrive at a qualitatively new way of gauge symmetry breaking. Using the Schwinger-DeWitt technique, we explore the one-loop renormalization of this new model in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spacetime -- Unification of Matter and Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gravity (or quantum spacetime) is to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics into a single theoretical framework and presented as the most important open puzzle in fundamental physics. The development of a microscopic theory of quantum spacetime becomes the key problem about quantum gravity. This paper is an attempt to solve this problem. The starting point of this paper is very simple -- physical variant with higher-order variability (see the below discussion). Based on this simple starting point, a microscopic theory for quantum spacetime is developed, including its matrix representation for quantum states, its time evolution, its geometry quantization, its generalized symmetry, its canonical quantization, and the uncertainty principle, ... In particular, an unexpected result is obtained: a Dirac particle has fixed size rather than a point on spacetime! The result leads to a great unification of matter and spacetime -- the particles constitute the basic blocks of spacetime and spacetime is really a multi-particle system that is made of matter. A triangular equivalence principle in quantum spacetime is explored -- the equivalence relationship between matter, quantum spacetime itself and topological defects of quantum spacetime. As a result, this work would help researchers to understand the mysteries in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics -- A Theory of Dynamics for "Space" on Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Till now, the foundation of quantum mechanics is still mysterious. To explore the mysteries in the foundation of quantum mechanics, people always take it for granted that quantum processes must be some types of fields/objects on a rigid space. In this paper, we give a new idea -- the space is no more rigid and the matter is the certain changing of "space" itself rather than extra things on it. Based on this starting point, we develop a new framework based on quantum and classical mechanics. Now, physical laws emerge from different changings of regular changings on spacetime. Then, both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics become phenomenological theories and are interpreted by using the concepts of the microscopic properties of a single physical framework. In particular, the expanding/contracting dynamics for "space" leads to quantum mechanics. This will have a far-reaching impact on modern physics in the future.</description>
