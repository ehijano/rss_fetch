      <title>Improved estimators of causal emergence for large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in the study of complex systems is the quantification of emergence -- understood as the ability of the system to exhibit collective behaviours that cannot be traced down to the individual components. While recent work has proposed practical measures to detect emergence, these approaches tend to double-count the contribution of shared components, which substantially hinders their capability to effectively study large systems. In this work, we introduce a family of improved information-theoretic measures of emergence that iteratively correct for double-counted terms. Our approach is computationally efficient and provides a controllable trade-off between computational load and sensitivity, leading to more accurate and versatile estimates of emergence. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by successfully detecting emergence in both simulated and real-world data related to flocking behaviour.</description>

      <title>Effective Graph Resistance as Cumulative Heat Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective graph resistance is a fundamental structural metric in network science, widely used to quantify global connectivity, compare network architectures, and assess robustness in flow-based systems. Despite its importance, current formulations rely mainly on spectral or pseudo-inverse Laplacian representations, offering limited physical insight into how structural features shape this quantity or how it can be efficiently optimized. Here, we establish an exact and physically transparent relationship between effective graph resistance and the cumulative heat dissipation generated by Laplacian diffusion dynamics. We show that the total heat dissipated during relaxation to equilibrium precisely equals the effective graph resistance. This dynamical viewpoint uncovers a natural multi-scale decomposition of the Laplacian spectrum: early-time dissipation is governed by degree-based local structure, intermediate times isolate eigenvalues below the spectral mean, and long times are dominated by the algebraic connectivity. These multi-scale properties yield continuous and interpretable strategies for modifying network structure and constructing optimized ensembles, enabling improvements that are otherwise NP-hard to achieve via combinatorial methods. Our results unify structural and dynamical perspectives on network connectivity and provide new tools for analyzing, comparing, and optimizing complex networks across domains.</description>

      <title>Modelling cultural evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal modelling provides a toolkit for understanding cultural dynamics, from individual decisions to recurring patterns of change. This chapter explains what models are and why they matter. Using a precise, shared language, they aid thinking and communication by turning fuzzy assumptions into clear, comparable, testable claims. The chapter describes the modelling process, trading explanatory clarity against predictive specificity. Four families of models are surveyed, from the micro-level with optimising agents to macro-level dynamics with heuristic or even implicit agents, covering reasoning (Bayesian inference, game theory), adaptive updating (reinforcement learning, evolutionary games), mean-field approaches (compartmental models, population dynamics), and complex systems (agent-based models, social networks). Building on these, a general template for modelling cultural evolution is outlined that connects system states, cognitive processes, behaviour, and macro-level outcomes in dynamic loops, linking individuals, groups, institutions, and their environments. Taken together, these tools support a pluralist but coherent understanding of cultural change.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of cultural systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Culture is not just traits but a dynamic system of interdependent beliefs, practices and artefacts embedded in cognitive, social and material structures. Culture evolves as these entities interact, generating path dependence, attractor states and tension, with long-term stability punctuated by rapid systemic transformations. Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.</description>

      <title>Non-dilemmatic social dynamics promote cooperation in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various theoretical and empirical studies have accounted for why humans cooperate in competitive environments. Although prior work has revealed that network structure and multiplex interactions can promote cooperation, most theory assumes that individuals play similar dilemma games in all social contexts. However, real-world agents may participate in a diversity of interactions, not all of which present dilemmas. We develop an evolutionary game model on multilayer networks in which one layer supports the prisoner's dilemma game, while the other follows constant-selection dynamics, representing biased but non-dilemmatic competition, akin to opinion or fad spreading. Our theoretical analysis reveals that coupling a social dilemma layer to a non-dilemmatic constant-selection layer robustly enhances cooperation in many cases, across different multilayer networks, updating rules, and payoff schemes. These findings suggest that embedding individuals within diverse networked settings -- even those unrelated to direct social dilemmas -- can be a principled approach to engineering cooperation in socio-ecological and organizational systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling Epidemic Dynamics of Mutant Strains with Evolutionary Game-based Vaccination Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outbreak of mutant strains and vaccination behaviors have been the focus of recent epidemiological research, but most existing epidemic models failed to simultaneously capture viral mutation and consider the complexity and behavioral dynamics of vaccination. To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors' choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies.</description>

      <title>Statistical study of the transcript of vote counts in multi-member constituencies: Identifying electoral fraud and reconstructing voting returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose new methods of electoral statistics. With their help, we study transcripts of vote counting in municipal elections. We construct and apply effective statistical tests to detect the ballot stuffing at the level of individual candidates and ballots as a whole. We study the difference between falsifications for the administration and against the opposition. We construct indicators assessing the credibility of transcripts as a whole. We propose a model of voter behavior to reconstruct the results of multi-member voting at the level of an individual precinct. We carry out an independent verification of the reconstruction.</description>
