      <title>Carath\'eodory hyperbolicity, volume estimates and level structures over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a generalization of the nonexistence of level structures as Nadel, Noguchi, Hwang-To, for quasi-projective manifolds uniformized by strongly Carath\'eodory hyperbolic complex manifolds. Examples include moduli space of compact Riemann surfaces with a finite number punctures and locally Hermitian symmetric spaces of finite volume. This leads to the nonexistence of a holomorphic map from a Riemann surface of fixed genus into the compactification of such a quasi-projective manifold when the level structure is sufficiently high. To achieve our goal, we have also established some volume estimates for mapping of curves into these manifolds, extending some earlier result of Hwang-To to a more general setting. A version of Schwarz Lemma applicable to manifolds equipped with nonsmooth complex Finsler metric is also given.</description>

Abstract: We describe the irreducible components of the moduli spaces of rational curves on Artin-Mumford double solids. This provides the first example of Fano varieties that satisfy Geometric Manin's Conjecture with multiple Manin components in moduli space of rational curves for each degree.</description>

      <title>The two extremal rays of some Hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider projective Hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of dimension four that are deformation equivalent to Hilbert squares of K3 surfaces. In case such a manifold admits a divisorial contraction, the exceptional divisor is a conic bundle over a K3 surface. There are five types of such conic bundles. In case the manifold has Picard rank two and has two (birational) divisorial contractions we determine the types of these conic bundles. There are exactly seven cases. For the Fano varieties of cubic fourfolds there are only four cases and we provide examples of these.</description>

Abstract: We construct algebraic families of smooth affine $\mathbb{A}^1$-contractible varieties of every dimension $n\geq 4$ over fields of characteristic zero which are non-isomorphic to affine spaces and potential counterexamples to the Zariski Cancellation Problem. We further prove that these families of varieties are also counter examples to the generalized Cancellation problem.</description>

      <title>Persistence of unknottedness of clean Lagrangian intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ be two Lagrangian spheres in a $6$-dimensional symplectic manifold. Assume that $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ intersect cleanly along a circle that is unknotted in both $Q_0$ and $Q_1$. We prove that there is no nearby Hamiltonian isotopy of $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ to a pair of Lagrangian spheres meeting cleanly along a circle that is knotted in either component. The proof is based on a classification for spherical Lagrangians in a Stein neighborhood of the union $Q_0\cup Q_1$ and the deep result that lens space rational Dehn surgeries characterizes the unknot.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Casas-Alvero conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casas-Alvero conjecture states that if $f(X)$ is a monic univariate polynomial of degree $d$ over a characteristic $0$ field $\mathbb{K}$ such that $\gcd(f, f_{i})$ is non-trivial for each $i=1, \dots, d-1$, then $f(X)=(X-\alpha)^d$ for some $\alpha\in \mathbb{K}$. In this paper, we prove the Casas-Alvero conjecture for polynomials of any degree $d\geq 3$ over any characteristic $0$ field using Koszul homology.</description>

      <title>$L$-smooth factorization for Noetherian $F$-finite rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any homomorphism between Noetherian $F$-finite rings can be factored into a regular morphism between Noetherian $F$-finite rings followed by a surjection. This result establishes an analog of the 'smooth-by-surjective' factorization for finite type maps. As part of our analysis, we observe that for maps of Noetherian $F$-finite rings, regularity and formal smoothness are both equivalent to $L$-smoothness, meaning that the cotangent complex, as in the smooth case, is a locally free module of finite rank concentrated in degree zero.
  Our findings may also be viewed as a relative version of Gabber's final remark in \citep{Gab04}, which states that any Noetherian $F$-finite ring is a quotient of a regular Noetherian $F$-finite ring.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type $A$ and type $B$ permutohedral varieties are classic examples of mathematics, and their topological invariants are well known. This naturally leads to the investigation of the topology of their real loci, known as type $A$ and type $B$ real permutohedral varieties.
  The rational cohomology rings of type $A$ real permutohedral varieties are fully described in terms of alternating permutations. Until now, only rational Betti numbers of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties have been described in terms of $B$-snakes. In this paper, we explicitly describe the multiplicative structure of the cohomology rings of type $B$ real permutohedral varieties in terms of $B$-snakes.</description>

      <title>Local Normal Forms of Noncommutative Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes local normal forms of functions in noncommuting variables, up to equivalence generated by isomorphism of noncommutative Jacobi algebras, extending singularity theory in the style of Arnold's commutative local normal forms into the noncommutative realm. This generalisation unveils many new phenomena, including an ADE classification when the Jacobi ring has dimension zero and, by taking suitable limits, a further ADE classification in dimension one. These are natural generalisations of the simple singularities and those with infinite multiplicity in Arnold's classification. We obtain normal forms away from some exceptional Type E cases. Remarkably these normal forms have no continuous parameters, and the key new feature is that the noncommutative world affords larger families.
  This theory has a range of immediate consequences to the birational geometry of 3-folds. The normal forms of dimension zero are the analytic classification of smooth 3-fold flops, and one outcome of NC singularity theory is the first list of all Type D flopping germs, generalising Reid's famous pagoda classification of Type A, with variants covering Type E. The normal forms of dimension one have further applications to divisorial contractions to a curve. In addition, the general techniques also give strong evidence towards new contractibility criteria for rational curves.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Looijenga's conjecture for smoothing surface cusp singularities to the equivariant setting. Moreover, we prove that for any cusp singularity which admits a one-parameter smoothing, the smoothing can always be induced by smoothing of locally complete intersection cusps. The result provides evidence for the existence of the moduli stack of $\lci$ covers over semi-log-canonical surfaces.</description>

We classify the situation where the smoothing of a simple elliptic singularity, a cusp singularity or its cyclic quotient is induced by the equivariant smoothing of the $\lci$ covers.</description>

      <title>Diagonal property and weak point property of higher rank divisors and certain Hilbert schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of the diagonal property and the weak point property for an ind-variety. We prove that the ind-varieties of higher rank divisors of integral slopes on a smooth projective curve have the weak point property. Moreover, we show that the ind-variety of $(1,n)$-divisors has the diagonal property and is a locally complete linear ind-variety and calculate its Picard group. Furthermore, we obtain that the Hilbert schemes of a curve associated to the good partitions of a constant polynomial satisfy the diagonal property. In the process of obtaining this, we provide the exact number of such Hilbert schemes up to isomorphism by proving that the multi symmetric products associated to two distinct partitions of a positive integer $n$ are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Secant varieties of generalised Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secant varieties of a homogeneously embedded generalised Grassmannian $G/P$ inherit the natural group action, and one can reduce the study of their local geometric properties to $G$-orbit representatives. The case of secant varieties of lines is particularly elegant as their $G$-orbits are induced by $P$-orbits in both $G/P$ and $\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{p}$. Parabolic orbits are a classical problem in Representation Theory, well understood when $G/P$ is cominuscule. Exploiting them, we provide a complete and uniform description of both the identifiable and singular loci of the secant variety of lines to any cominuscule variety. We also introduce a finer version of the $2$-nd Terracini locus, called $2$-nd strong-Terracini locus, and we determine it for cominuscule varieties. Finally, we analyse the non-cominuscule case of isotropic Grassmannians for comparison, and we highlight a few differences.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Collections for Toric Fano Fourfolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beilinson first gave a resolution of the diagonal for $\mathbb{P}^n$. Generalizing this, a modification of the cellular resolution of the diagonal given by Bayer-Popescu- Sturmfels gives a (non-minimal, in general) virtual resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric varieties and toric Deligne-Mumford stacks which are a global quotient of a smooth projective variety by a finite abelian group. In the past year, Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev gave in particular a symmetric, minimal resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric varieties. We give implications for exceptional collections on smooth projective toric Fano varieties in dimension 4. We find that for 72 out of 124 smooth projective toric Fano 4-folds, the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal yields a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles, which coincides exactly with satisfying a numerical criterion due to Bondal.</description>

Abstract: We compute the twisted cohomology of the mapping class group with level structures with coefficients the $r$-tensor power of the Prym representations for any positive integer $r$. When $r\ge 2$, the cohomology turns out to be not stable when the genus is large, but it is stable when r is $0$ or $1$. As a corollary to our computations, we prove that the symplectic Prym representation of any finite abelian regular cover of a non-closed finite-type surface is infinitesimally rigid.</description>

Abstract: The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup $F_2$, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC'24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing $F_2 \times F_2$, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components in Hochschild cohomology of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $G/B$ the associated complete flag variety. The Hochschild cohomology $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ is a geometric invariant of the flag variety related to its generalized deformation theory and has the structure of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module. We study this invariant via representation-theoretic methods; in particular, we give a complete list of irreducible subrepresentations in $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ when $G=SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ or is of exceptional type (and conjecturally for all types) along with nontrivial lower bounds on their multiplicities. These results follow from a conjecture due to Kostant on the structure of the tensor product representation $V(\rho) \otimes V(\rho)$.</description>

      <title>Topological 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, and $A_\infty$-categories of Six, Five, and Four-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a continuation of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic (holomorphic) Floer homologies of seven, six, and five-manifolds, from the physics of a topologically-twisted 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ gauge theory on a Spin$(7)$-manifold via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with $G_2$ instanton, Donaldson-Thomas, and Haydys-Witten configurations on the seven, six, and five-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define hyperk\"ahler Floer homologies specified by hypercontact three-manifolds, and symplectic Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. In turn, this will allow us to derive Atiyah-Floer type dualities between the various gauge-theoretic Floer homologies and symplectic intersection Floer homologies of instanton moduli spaces. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 8d theory, one can derive novel Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories that categorify Donaldson-Thomas, Haydys-Witten, and Vafa-Witten configurations on six, five, and four-manifolds, respectively -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homologies of six and five-manifolds, and the Floer homology of four-manifolds from [arXiv:2311.18302] -- where an Atiyah-Floer type correspondence for the Donaldson-Thomas case can be established. Last but not least, topological invariance of the theory suggests a relation amongst these Floer homologies and Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-categories for certain Spin$(7)$-manifolds. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the conjectures by Donaldson-Thomas [2], Donaldson-Segal [3], Cherkis [4], Hohloch-Noetzel-Salamon [5], Salamon [6], Haydys [7], and Bousseau [8], and more.</description>
