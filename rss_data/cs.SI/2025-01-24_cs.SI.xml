      <title>A model for French voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of opinion dynamics describe how opinions are shaped in various environments. While these models are able to replicate macroscopical opinion distributions observed in real-world scenarios, their capacity to align with data at the microscopical level remains mostly untested. We evaluate the capacity of the multi-state voter model with zealots to capture individual opinions in a fine-grained Twitter dataset collected during the 2017 French Presidential elections. Our findings reveal a strong correspondence between individual opinion distributions in the equilibrium state of the model and ground-truth political leanings of the users. Additionally, we demonstrate that discord probabilities accurately identify pairs of like-minded users. These results emphasize the validity of the voter model in complex settings, and advocate for further empirical evaluations of opinion dynamics models at the microscopical level.</description>

      <title>TROPIC -- Trustworthiness Rating of Online Publishers through online Interactions Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for assessing the trustworthiness of news publishers face high costs and scalability issues. The tool presented in this paper supports the efforts of specialized organizations by providing a solution that, starting from an online discussion, provides (i) trustworthiness ratings for previously unclassified news publishers and (ii) an interactive platform to guide annotation efforts and improve the robustness of the ratings. The system implements a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of online news publishers based on user interactions on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Targeting heuristics for cost-optimized institutional incentives in heterogeneous networked populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world is currently grappling with challenges on both local and global scales, many of which demand coordinated behavioral changes. However, breaking away from the status is often difficult due to deeply ingrained social norms. In such cases, social systems may require seemingly exogenous interventions to set off endogenous, largely irreversible processes that drive change -- social tipping. While studies have looked at targeted interventions, real-life constraints faced by policymakers, like minimizing costs while ensuring a quick and fair transition, remain understudied. To address this complexity, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that accounts for individual heterogeneity and networks of local influence. We implement various heuristics based on information about individual preferences and commonly used local network properties. Results show that where the change is initiated in the population and the direction in which it propagates is essential to the effectiveness of interventions. We identify optimal strategies under different scenarios, such as varying levels of resistance to change, preference heterogeneity, and homophily. These results provide insights that can be experimentally tested and help policymakers to better direct incentives.</description>

      <title>Evidence of social learning across symbolic cultural barriers in sperm whales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide quantitative evidence suggesting social learning in sperm whales across socio-cultural boundaries, using acoustic data from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Traditionally, sperm whale populations are categorized into clans based on their vocal repertoire: the rhythmically patterned click sequences (codas) that they use. Among these codas, identity codas function as symbolic markers for each clan, accounting for 35-60% of codas they produce. We introduce a computational method to model whale speech, which encodes rhythmic micro-variations within codas, capturing their vocal style. We find that vocal style-clans closely align with repertoire-clans. However, contrary to vocal repertoire, we show that sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, i.e. most codas, suggesting social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, this subcoda structure model offers a framework for comparing communication systems in other species, with potential implications for deeper understanding of vocal and cultural transmission within animal societies.</description>

      <title>BOPIM: Bayesian Optimization for influence maximization on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed nodes which maximizes the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and complicated objective function. There are at least two key challenges, however, that must be overcome, primarily due to the inputs coming from a cardinality-constrained, non-Euclidean, combinatorial space. The first is constructing the kernel function for the Gaussian Process regression. We propose two kernels, one based on the Hamming distance between seed sets and the other leveraging the Jaccard coefficient between node's neighbors. The second challenge is the acquisition function. For this, we use the Expected Improvement function, suitably adjusting for noise in the observations, and optimize it using a greedy algorithm to account for the cardinality constraint. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we prove that BOPIM outperforms competing methods and yields comparable influence spreads to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as ten times faster. In addition, we find that the Hamming kernel performs favorably compared to the Jaccard kernel in nearly all settings, a somewhat surprising result as the former does not explicitly account for the graph structure. Finally, we demonstrate two ways that the proposed method can quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for IM.</description>

      <title>Models for information propagation on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07577v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and unify classes of different models for information propagation over graphs. In a first class, propagation is modelled as a wave which emanates from a set of \emph{known} nodes at an initial time, to all other \emph{unknown} nodes at later times with an ordering determined by the arrival time of the information wave front. A second class of models is based on the notion of a travel time along paths between nodes. The time of information propagation from an initial \emph{known} set of nodes to a node is defined as the minimum of a generalised travel time over subsets of all admissible paths. A final class is given by imposing a local equation of an eikonal form at each \emph{unknown} node, with boundary conditions at the \emph{known} nodes. The solution value of the local equation at a node is coupled to those of neighbouring nodes with lower values. We provide precise formulations of the model classes and prove equivalences between them. Finally we apply the front propagation models on graphs to semi-supervised learning via label propagation and information propagation on trust networks.</description>
