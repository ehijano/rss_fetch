      <title>Hunting for Room Temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room temperature superconductivity, as one of the famous jewels on the crown of physics, has attracted continuous attention and unremitting efforts from numerous scientists. In recent years, more and more reports on room temperature superconductivity evoke many anticipations, but results remain controversial. Here, we introduce the characteristics of superconducting phenomena and propose 10 feasible paths to achieve room-temperature superconductivity in the future. This is an Editorial of The Innovation Materials in Feb. 2025.</description>

      <title>Selective electron-phonon coupling strength from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy: The case of MgB$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between quasiparticles and bosonic excitations rules the energy transfer pathways in condensed matter systems. The possibility of inferring the strength of specific coupling channels from their characteristic time scales measured in nonequilibrium experiments is still an open question. Here, we investigate MgB$_2$, in which conventional superconductivity at temperatures as high as 39 K is mediated by the strong coupling between the conduction electrons and the E$_{2g}$ phonon mode. By means of broadband time-resolved optical spectroscopy, we show that this selective electron-phonon coupling dictates the nonequilibrium optical response of MgB$_2$ at early times (&lt;100 fs) after photoexcitation. Furthermore, based on an effective temperature model analysis, we estimate its contribution to the total electron-boson coupling function extracted from complementary equilibrium spectroscopy approaches, namely optical reflectivity and ARPES. The coupling strength with the E$_{2g}$ phonon modes is thus estimated to be $\lambda$ ~ 0.56, which is approximately half of the total coupling constant, in agreement with ab-initio calculations from the literature. As a benchmark, broadband time-resolved optical spectroscopy is performed also on the isostructural and non-superconducting compound AlB$_2$, showing that the nonequilibrium optical response relaxes on a slower timescale due to the lack of strongly-coupled phonon modes. Our findings demonstrate the possibility to resolve and quantify selective electron-phonon coupling from nonequilibrium optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Microwave Microscope Studies of Trapped Vortex Dynamics in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped vortices in superconductors introduce residual resistance in superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities and disrupt the operation of superconducting quantum and digital electronic circuits. Understanding the detailed dynamics of trapped vortices under oscillating magnetic fields is essential for advancing these technologies. We have developed a near-field magnetic microwave microscope to study the dynamics of a limited number of trapped vortices under the probe when stimulated by a localized rf magnetic field. By measuring the local second-harmonic response ($P_\mathrm{2f}$) at sub-femto-Watt levels, we isolate signals exclusively arising from trapped vortices, excluding contributions from surface defects and Meissner screening currents. Toy models of Niobium superconductor hosting vortex pinning sites are introduced and studied with Time-Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations of probe/sample interaction to better understand the measured second-harmonic response. The simulation results demonstrate that the second-harmonic response of trapped vortex motion under a localized rf magnetic field shares key features with the experimental data. This measurement technique provides access to vortex dynamics at the micron scale, such as depinning events and spatially-resolved pinning properties, as demonstrated in measurements on a Niobium film with an antidot flux pinning array.</description>

      <title>An rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with -84 dBm input saturation power across more than one octave bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-SQUID-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm, while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Comment on 2501.17230 and 2502.00103 "Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO3 via the generalized Frohlich and deformation potential mechanisms" and "Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This comment critically examines the claims made in arXiv papers arXiv:2501.17230 and arXiv:2502.00103, which argue that a multiplicity of polar optical phonons can generate a long-range attractive interaction via a generalized Frohlich coupling. I identify a fundamental flaw in their derivation, showing that their result relies on an unphysical assumption--specifically, neglecting the intermode Coulomb interactions between different polar optical phonons. By restoring these missing interactions I show the screened Coulomb interaction is always repulsive in the static limit.</description>
