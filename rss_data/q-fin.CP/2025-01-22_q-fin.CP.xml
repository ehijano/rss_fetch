      <title>A statistical technique for cleaning option price data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recorded option pricing datasets are not always freely available. Additionally, these datasets often contain numerous prices which are either higher or lower than can reasonably be expected. Various reasons for these unexpected observations are possible, including human error in the recording of the details associated with the option in question. In order for the analyses performed on these datasets to be reliable, it is necessary to identify and remove these options from the dataset. In this paper, we list three distinct problems often found in recorded option price datasets alongside means of addressing these. The methods used are justified using sound statistical reasoning and remove option prices violating the standard assumption of no arbitrage. An attractive aspect of the proposed technique is that no option pricing model-based assumptions are used. Although the discussion is restricted to European options, the procedure is easily modified for use with exotic options as well. As a final contribution, the paper contains a link to six option pricing datasets which have already been cleaned using the proposed methods and can be freely used by researchers.</description>

      <title>Defaultable bond liquidity spread estimation: an option-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends an option-theoretic approach to estimate liquidity spreads for corporate bonds. Inspired by Longstaff's equity market framework and subsequent work by Koziol and Sauerbier on risk-free zero-coupon bonds, the model views liquidity as a look-back option. The model accounts for the interplay of risk-free rate volatility and credit risk. A numerical analysis highlights the impact of these factors on the liquidity spread, particularly for bonds with different maturities and credit ratings. The methodology is applied to estimate the liquidity spread for unquoted bonds, with a specific case study on the Republic of Italy's debt, leveraging market data to calibrate model parameters and classify liquid versus illiquid emissions. This approach provides a robust tool for pricing illiquid bonds, emphasizing the importance of marketability in debt security valuation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo with Domain Transformation for Efficient Fourier Pricing of Multi-Asset Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently pricing multi-asset options poses a significant challenge in quantitative finance. Fourier methods leverage the regularity properties of the integrand in the Fourier domain to accurately and rapidly value options that typically lack regularity in the physical domain. However, most of the existing Fourier approaches face hurdles in high-dimensional settings due to the tensor product (TP) structure of the commonly employed numerical quadrature techniques. To overcome this difficulty, this work advocates using the randomized quasi-MC (RQMC) quadrature to improve the scalability of Fourier methods with high dimensions. The RQMC technique benefits from the smoothness of the integrand and alleviates the curse of dimensionality while providing practical error estimates. Nonetheless, the applicability of RQMC on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^d$, requires a domain transformation to $[0,1]^d$, which may result in singularities of the transformed integrand at the corners of the hypercube, and hence deteriorate the performance of RQMC. To circumvent this difficulty, we design an efficient domain transformation procedure based on boundary growth conditions on the transformed integrand. The proposed transformation preserves sufficient regularity of the original integrand for fast convergence of the RQMC method. To validate our analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of employing RQMC with an appropriate transformation to evaluate options in the Fourier space for various pricing models, payoffs, and dimensions. Finally, we highlight the computational advantage of applying RQMC over MC or TP in the Fourier domain, and over MC in the physical domain for options with up to 15 assets.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Heston model with deep differential networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a gradient-based deep learning framework to calibrate the Heston option pricing model (Heston, 1993). Our neural network, henceforth deep differential network (DDN), learns both the Heston pricing formula for plain-vanilla options and the partial derivatives with respect to the model parameters. The price sensitivities estimated by the DDN are not subject to the numerical issues that can be encountered in computing the gradient of the Heston pricing function. Thus, our network is an excellent pricing engine for fast gradient-based calibrations. Extensive tests on selected equity markets show that the DDN significantly outperforms non-differential feedforward neural networks in terms of calibration accuracy. In addition, it dramatically reduces the computational time with respect to global optimizers that do not use gradient information.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Approach for the Pricing of Debt Securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the pricing of debt securities under general time-inhomogeneous short-rate diffusion processes. The pricing of bonds, bond options, callable/putable bonds, and convertible bonds (CBs) is covered. Using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximations, we obtain closed-form matrix expressions to approximate the price of bonds and bond options under general one-dimensional short-rate processes. A simple and efficient algorithm is also developed to price callable/putable debt. The availability of a closed-form expression for the price of zero-coupon bonds allows for the perfect fit of the approximated model to the current market term structure of interest rates, regardless of the complexity of the underlying diffusion process selected. We further consider the pricing of CBs under general bi-dimensional time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes to model equity and short-rate dynamics. Credit risk is also incorporated into the model using the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998). Based on a two-layer CTMC method, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the price of convertible bonds. When conversion is only allowed at maturity, a closed-form matrix expression is obtained. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method across a wide range of model parameters and short-rate models.</description>
