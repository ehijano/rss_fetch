      <title>Universal materials model of deep-learning density functional theory Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing large materials models has emerged as a critical endeavor for materials research in the new era of artificial intelligence, but how to achieve this fantastic and challenging objective remains elusive. Here, we propose a feasible pathway to address this paramount pursuit by developing universal materials models of deep-learning density functional theory Hamiltonian (DeepH), enabling computational modeling of the complicated structure-property relationship of materials in general. By constructing a large materials database and substantially improving the DeepH method, we obtain a universal materials model of DeepH capable of handling diverse elemental compositions and material structures, achieving remarkable accuracy in predicting material properties. We further showcase a promising application of fine-tuning universal materials models for enhancing specific materials models. This work not only demonstrates the concept of DeepH's universal materials model but also lays the groundwork for developing large materials models, opening up significant opportunities for advancing artificial intelligence-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models Are Promising for Ab Initio Structure Solutions from Nanocrystalline Powder Diffraction Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in materials science is the determination of the structure of nanometer sized objects. Here we present a novel approach that uses a generative machine learning model based on a Diffusion model that is trained on 45,229 known structures. The model factors both the measured diffraction pattern as well as relevant statistical priors on the unit cell of atomic cluster structures. Conditioned only on the chemical formula and the information-scarce finite-size broadened powder diffraction pattern, we find that our model, PXRDnet, can successfully solve simulated nanocrystals as small as 10 angstroms across 200 materials of varying symmetry and complexity, including structures from all seven crystal systems. We show that our model can determine structural solutions with up to $81.5\%$ accuracy, as measured by structural correlation. Furthermore, PXRDnet is capable of solving structures from noisy diffraction patterns gathered in real-world experiments. We suggest that data driven approaches, bootstrapped from theoretical simulation, will ultimately provide a path towards determining the structure of previously unsolved nano-materials.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Coulomb interactions for machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ubiquitous approach to obtain transferable machine learning-based models of potential energy surfaces for atomistic systems is to decompose the total energy into a sum of local atom-centred contributions. However, in many systems non-negligible long-range electrostatic effects must be taken into account as well. We introduce a general mathematical framework to study how such long-range effects can be included in a way that (i) allows charge equilibration and (ii) retains the locality of the learnable atom-centred contributions to ensure transferability. Our results give partial explanations for the success of existing machine learned potentials that include equilibriation and provide perspectives how to design such schemes in a systematic way. To complement the rigorous theoretical results, we describe a practical scheme for fitting the energy and electron density of water clusters.</description>

      <title>Emergent Wigner phases in moir\'e superlattice from deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice designed in stacked van der Waals material provides a dynamic platform for hosting exotic and emergent condensed matter phenomena. However, the relevance of strong correlation effects and the large size of moir\'e unit cells pose significant challenges for traditional computational techniques. To overcome these challenges, we develop an unsupervised deep learning approach to uncover electronic phases emerging from moir\'e systems based on variational optimization of neural network many-body wavefunction. Our approach has identified diverse quantum states, including novel phases such as generalized Wigner crystals, Wigner molecular crystals, and previously unreported Wigner covalent crystals. These discoveries provide insights into recent experimental studies and suggest new phases for future exploration. They also highlight the crucial role of spin polarization in determining Wigner phases. More importantly, our proposed deep learning approach is proven general and efficient, offering a powerful framework for studying moir\'e physics.</description>

      <title>A precision benchmark suite for nuclear reactor point kinetics equations via converged accelerated Taylor series (cats)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme benchmarks of ten or more places for the point kinetics equations for time dependent nuclear reactor power transients are rare. Therefore, to establish an extreme benchmark, we will employ a Taylor series with continuous analytical continuation (CAC) to solve the ordinary differential equations of point kinetics including feedback. Non-linear Wynn-epsilon convergence acceleration confirms the highly precise solutions for neutron and precursor densities. Through adaptive partitioning of time intervals, the proposed Converged Accelerated Taylor Series, or CATS algorithm [1] in double precision, automatically performs successive mesh refinement to obtain high precision initial conditions for each sub-interval, with the intent to reduce propagation error. Confirmation of ten to twelve places comes from comparison to the BEFD (Backward Euler Finite Difference) algorithm [2] in quadruple precision also developed by the author. We report benchmark results for common cases found in the literature including step, ramp, zigzag and sinusoidal prescribed reactivity insertions and insertions with non-linear adiabatic Doppler feedback. We also establish a suite of new prescribed reactivity insertions and insertions with feedback, based on reactivities with Taylor series as suggested by the CATS algorithm.</description>

      <title>Random Close Packing of Semi-Flexible Polymers in Two Dimensions: Emergence of Local and Global Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically study the effect of chain stiffness on the packing ability of linear polymers composed of hard spheres in extremely confined monolayers, corresponding effectively to 2D films. First, we explore the limit of random close packing as a function of the equilibrium bending angle and then quantify the local and global order by the degree of crystallinity and the nematic or tetratic orientational order parameter, respectively. A multi-scale wealth of structural behavior is observed, which is inherently absent in the case of athermal individual monomers and is surprisingly richer than its 3D counterpart under bulk conditions. As a general trend an isotropic to nematic transition is observed at sufficiently high surfaces coverages which is followed by the establishment of the tetratic state, which in turn marks the onset of the random close packing. For chains with right-angle bonds, the incompatibility of the imposed bending angle with the neighbor geometry of the triangular crystal leads to a singular intra- and inter-polymer tiling pattern made of squares and triangles with optimal local filling at high surface concentrations. The present study could serve as a first step towards the design of hard colloidal polymers with tunable structural behavior for 2D applications.</description>

      <title>The coupling mechanism between crossed-beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling mechanism between crossed beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas are studied by theoretical analysis, fluid simulations and particle in cell(PIC) simulations. The numerical models of laser plasma instabilities are constructed by solving coupling equations with Schodinger equations form, and the fluid simulation results are confirmed by fluid theory and PIC simulations.In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does not occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is lower than 1%, SBS will be affected by CBET, the CBET energy gain will still agree with theoretical predications. However, In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is higher than 1%, the CBET spatial gain will be reduced by the interaction of CBET and SBS, and the huge difference of SBS reflectivity for two crossed laser beams is observed.In the PIC simulations, we found that lower ZTe=Ti will significantly reduce the interaction between CBET and SBS (Z is the ion charge, Teis the electron temperature, Ti is the ion temperature).</description>

      <title>Data-driven study of the enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enthalpy of mixing in the liquid phase is a thermodynamic property reflecting interactions between elements that is key to predict phase transformations. Widely used models exist to predict it, but they have never been systematically evaluated. To address this, we collect a large amount of enthalpy of mixing data in binary liquids from a review of about 1000 thermodynamic evaluations. This allows us to clarify the prediction accuracy of Miedema's model which is state-of-the-art. We show that more accurate predictions can be obtained from a machine learning model based on LightGBM, and we provide them in 2415 binary systems. The data we collect also allows us to evaluate another empirical model to predict the excess heat capacity that we apply to 2211 binary liquids. We then extend the data collection to ternary metallic liquids and find that, when mixing is exothermic, extrapolations from the binary systems by Muggianu's model systematically lead to slight overestimations of roughly 10% close to the equimolar composition. Therefore, our LightGBM model can provide reasonable estimates for ternary alloys and, by extension, for multicomponent alloys. Our findings extracted from rich datasets can be used to feed thermodynamic, empirical and machine learning models for material development.</description>

      <title>Gateway to all-optical spin switching in Heusler ferrimagnets: Pancharatnam-Berry tensor and magnetic moment ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-optical spin switching (AOS) is a new phenomenon found in a small group of magnetic media, where a single laser pulse can switch spins from one direction to another, without assistance of a magnetic field, on a time scale much shorter than existing magnetic technology. However, despite intensive efforts over a decade, its underlying working principle remains elusive. Here through manganese-based Heusler ferrimagnets, we show that a group of flat bands around the Fermi level act as gateway states to form efficient channels or spin switching, where their noncentrosymmetry allows us to correlate the spin dynamics to the second-order optical response. To quantify their efficacy, we introduce the third-rank Pancharatnam-Berry tensor (PB tensor), $\boldsymbol{\eta}^{(3)}=\langle i |{\bf p} |m\rangle \langle m|{\bf p} |f\rangle \langle f|{\bf p} |i\rangle,$ where $|i\rangle$, $|m\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$ are initial, intermediate and final band states, respectively, and ${\bf p}$ is the momentum operator. A picture emerges: Those which show AOS, such as the recently discovered Mn$_2$RuGa, always have a large PB tensor element} but have a small sublattice spin moment ratio, consistent with the prior experimental small remanence criterion. This does not only reveal that the delicate balance between the large PB tensor element and the small sublattice spin ratio plays a decisive role in AOS, but also, conceptually, connects the $n$th-order nonlinear optics to $(n+1)$th-rank PB tensors in general.</description>

      <title>All-electron $BSE@GW$ method with Numeric Atom-Centered Orbitals for Extended Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green's function theory has emerged as a powerful many-body approach not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum chemistry in recent years. We have developed a new all-electron implementation of the BSE@GW formalism using numeric atom-centered orbital basis sets (Liu et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 044105 (2020)). We present our recent developments in implementing this formalism for extended systems with periodic boundary conditions. We discuss its numerical implementation and various convergence tests pertaining to numerical atom-centered orbitals, auxiliary basis sets for the resolution-of-identity formalism, and Brillouin zone sampling. Proof-of-principle examples are presented to compare with other formalisms, illustrating the new all-electron BSE@GW method for extended systems.</description>

      <title>Bloch sphere representation for Rabi oscillation driven by Rashba field in the two-dimensional harmonic confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the dynamical properties of Rabi oscillations driven by an alternating Rashba field applied to a two-dimensional (2D) harmonic confinement system. We solve the time-dependent (TD) Schr\"{o}dinger equation numerically and rewrite the resulting TD wavefunction onto the Bloch sphere (BS) using two BS parameters of the zenith ($\theta_B$) and azimuthal ($\phi_B$) angles, extracting the phase information $\phi_B$ as well as the mixing ratio $\theta_B$ between the two BS-pole states.
  We employed a two-state rotating wave (TSRW) approach and studied the fundamental features of $\theta_B$ and $\phi_B$ over time. The TSRW approach reveals a triangular wave formation in $\theta_B$. Moreover, at each apex of the triangular wave, the TD wavefunction passes through the BS pole, and the state is completely replaced by the opposite spin state. The TSRW approach also elucidates a linear change in $\phi_B$. The slope of $\phi_B$ vs. time is equal to the difference between the dynamical terms, leading to a confinement potential in the harmonic system. The TSRW approach further demonstrates a jump in the phase difference by $\pi$ when the wavefunction passes through the BS pole.
  The alternating Rashba field causes multiple successive Rabi transitions in the 2D harmonic system. We then introduce the effective BS (EBS) and transform these complicated transitions into an equivalent "single" Rabi one. Consequently, the EBS parameters $\theta_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\phi_B^{\mathrm{eff}}$ exhibit mixing and phase difference between two spin states $\alpha$ and $\beta$, leading to a deep understanding of the TD features of multi-Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, the combination of the BS representation with the TSRW approach successfully reveals the dynamical properties of the Rabi oscillation, even beyond the TSRW approximation.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

Abstract: We show that excitonic resonances and interexciton transitions can enhance the probability of spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a second-order optical response which generates entangled photon pairs. We benchmark our ab initio many-body calculations using experimental polar plots of second harmonic generation in NbOI$_2$, clearly demonstrating the relevance of excitons in the nonlinear response. A strong double-exciton resonance in 2D NbOCl$_2$ leads to giant enhancement in the second order susceptibility. Our work paves the way for the realization of efficient ultrathin quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>GPU-Native Adaptive Mesh Refinement with Application to Lattice Boltzmann Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) has garnered significant interest in General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) programming for computational fluid dynamics due to its straightforward GPU parallelization. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) can assist in efficiently resolving flows with regions of interest requiring a high degree of resolution while providing a means of coarsening when this degree of resolution is no longer needed at runtime. AMR is commonly implemented in parallel on the CPU or in a hybrid frameworks with GPU-acceleration rather than natively on the GPU due to lack of a recursive data structure. An AMR scheme that could manage a computational mesh entirely on the GPU without intermediate data transfers to/from the host device would provide a substantial speedup, however, this is tackled scarcely in the literature and open-source codes are not available. Consequently, the LBM with AMR continues to be parallelized in hybrid frameworks in recent literature. The current work addresses these two concerns: 1) a block-based GPU-native algorithm is developed for AMR in two- and three-dimensions and implemented in an open-source C++ code, and 2) a Lattice Boltzmann solver for incompressible hydrodynamic flows is constructed and equipped to the mesh. Although the implementation is tailored for LBM simulations, the outlined grid refinement procedure is compatible with other solvers over cell-centered block-based grids. Validation for three choices of velocity set and analysis of performance in terms of solver speed with single- and double-precision, fraction of time communicating between grids, and fraction of time in refinement are conducted using the lid-driven cavity and flow past a square cylinder test cases. Consumer- and datacenter-grade GPUs are both used to run the test cases in order to demonstrate versatility of the algorithm.

      <title>HTESP (High-throughput electronic structure package): a Package for the high-throughput $ab$ $initio$ calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-throughput $ab$ $initio$ calculations are the indispensable parts of data-driven discovery of new materials with desirable properties, as reflected in the establishment of several online material databases. The accumulation of extensive theoretical data through computations enables data-driven discovery by constructing machine learning and artificial intelligence models to predict novel compounds and forecast their properties. Efficient usage and extraction of data from these existing online material databases can accelerate the next stage materials discovery that targets different and more advanced properties, such as electron-phonon coupling for phonon-mediated superconductivity. However, extracting data from these databases, generating tailored input files for different $ab$ $initio$ calculations, performing such calculations, and analyzing new results can be demanding tasks. Here, we introduce a software package named "HTESP" (High-Throughput Electronic Structure Package) written in Python and Bash languages, which automates the entire workflow including data extraction, input file generation, calculation submission, result collection and plotting. Our HTESP will help speed up future computational materials discovery processes.</description>

      <title>PICL: Physics Informed Contrastive Learning for Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators have recently grown in popularity as Partial Differential Equation (PDE) surrogate models. Learning solution functionals, rather than functions, has proven to be a powerful approach to calculate fast, accurate solutions to complex PDEs. While much work has been done evaluating neural operator performance on a wide variety of surrogate modeling tasks, these works normally evaluate performance on a single equation at a time. In this work, we develop a novel contrastive pretraining framework utilizing Generalized Contrastive Loss that improves neural operator generalization across multiple governing equations simultaneously. Governing equation coefficients are used to measure ground-truth similarity between systems. A combination of physics-informed system evolution and latent-space model output are anchored to input data and used in our distance function. We find that physics-informed contrastive pretraining improves accuracy for the Fourier Neural Operator in fixed-future and autoregressive rollout tasks for the 1D and 2D Heat, Burgers', and linear advection equations.</description>

      <title>Ab initio property characterisation of thousands of previously unknown 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the stability and elementary properties of 4249 previously unexplored monolayer crystals. The monolayers comprise the most stable subset (energy within 0.1 eV/atom of the convex hull) of a larger portfolio of two-dimensional (2D) materials recently discovered using a deep generative model and systematic lattice decoration schemes. The relaxed 2D structures are run through the basic property workflow of the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB) to evaluate the dynamical stability and obtain the stiffness tensor, piezoelectric tensor, deformation potentials, Born and Bader charges, electronic band structure, effective masses, plasma frequency, Fermi surface, projected density of states, magnetic moments, magnetic exchange couplings, magnetic anisotropy, topological indices, optical- and infrared polarisability. We provide statistical overviews of the property data and highlight a few specific examples of interesting materials. Our work exposes previously unknown parts of the 2D chemical space and provides a basis for the discovery of 2D materials with specific properties. All data is available in the C2DB.</description>

      <title>Exploring Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

      <title>Building-block flow model for computational fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a closure model for wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES), referred to as the Building-block Flow Model (BFM). The foundation of the model rests on the premise that a finite collection of simple flows encapsulates the essential physics necessary to predict more complex scenarios. The BFM is implemented using artificial neural networks and introduces five advancements within the framework of WMLES: (1) It is designed to predict multiple flow regimes (wall turbulence under zero, favorable, adverse mean-pressure-gradient, and separation); (2) It unifies the closure model at solid boundaries (i.e., the wall model) and the rest of the flow (i.e., the subgrid-scale model) into a single entity; (3) It ensures consistency with numerical schemes and gridding strategy by accounting for numerical errors; (4) It is directly applicable to arbitrary complex geometries; (5) It can be scaled up to model additional flow physics in the future if needed (e.g., shockwaves and laminar-to-turbulent transition). The BFM is utilized to predict key quantities of interest in turbulent channel and pipe flows, a Gaussian bump, a simplified aircraft, and a realistic aircraft in landing configuration. In all cases, the BFM demonstrates similar or superior capabilities in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art closure models.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact electronic quantum many-body treatment of Kondo correlation in magnetic impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a prototypical quantum phenomenon arising from the interaction between localized electrons in a magnetic impurity and itinerant electrons in a metallic host. Although it has served as the testing ground for quantum many-body methods for decades, the precise description of Kondo physics with material specificity remains challenging. Here, we present a systematic ab initio approach to converge towards an exact zero-temperature electronic treatment of Kondo correlations. Across a series of 3d transition metals, we extract Kondo temperatures matching the subtle experimental trends, with an accuracy far exceeding that of standard models. We further obtain microscopic insight into the origin of these trends. More broadly, we demonstrate the possibility to start from fully ab initio many-body simulations and push towards the realm of converged predictions.</description>
