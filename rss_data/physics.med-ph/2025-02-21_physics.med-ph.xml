      <title>Accelerated X-Ray Fluorescence Computed Tomography via Multi-Pencil-Beam Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray fluorescence computed tomography (XFCT), a form of X-ray molecular imaging, offers detailed quantitative imaging capabilities for high-Z metal nanoparticles (MNPs), which are widely studied for their applications in multifunctional theranostics. Due to its affordability and accessibility, the benchtop XFCT prototype typically employs a single-pixel detector (SPD) with single-pencil-beam (SPB) X-ray excitation. While this design (resembling the first-generation CT geometry) achieves reliable detection sensitivity, it is hindered by long imaging times. The use of simultaneous multiple-pencil-beam (MPB) excitation presents a promising solution to significantly reduce imaging times. In this study, we developed a repeatable workflow that combines Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and 3D printing to design Nbeam-MPB collimator, where Nbeam is the number of beams generated by the collimator. As an initial test, we fabricated a 2-MPB collimator and evaluated the performance of 2-MPB-based XFCT imaging on a physical phantom and small animals surgically implanted with agarose pellets containing gold chloride (H[AuCl4]). The results demonstrated a 2x acceleration in image acquisition without compromising the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). We further investigated the concept of Nbeam-MPB acceleration on the MC computational XFCT system, which confirmed the feasibility of achieving at least 4x acceleration with 4-MPB excitation. Combined with additional system optimization, such as X-ray beam flux optimization, XFCT imaging could be further accelerated, reducing acquisition time from hours to minutes and meeting the requirements for routine MNP imaging.</description>

      <title>Instrumented mouthguards in elite sports: Validity and head acceleration event (HAE) incidence in NCAA American Football</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To determine the on-field validity of instrumented mouthguards (iMGs) in American football and to quantify head acceleration event (HAE) incidence in NCAA football players. Methods: Instrumented mouthguards were fitted to 35 male NCAA football players. Head kinematic data were collected during 64 player matches. On-field validity was determined through video review with positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity values calculated. HAE incidence was calculated as the number of HAEs per player match and stratified by Offense and Defense positions. Results: On-field validity of the Prevent Biometrics iMG in NCAA American Football indicates a sensitivity was 0.89 and PPV ranging from 0.76-0.98 based on false positive definitions. The incidence of PLA and PAA HAEs above a range of thresholds in Defense and Offense appear similar. The incidence of HAEs above 10 g was 11.2 and 11.3 HAEs per player match for Defense and Offense, respectively, while PAA incidence above 1.0 krad/s2 was 5.5 and 6.9 HAEs per player match for Defense and Offense, respectively. Incidence of HAEs above 30 g was 1.6 and 2.6 per player match and 0.9 and 1.4 for HAEs above 2.0 krad/s2 for Defense and Offense, respectively. Conclusion: The Prevent Biometrics iMG appears suitable for measuring HAEs in elite American football. The study provides a benchmark assessment of HAE incidence in elite American Football and lays a foundation for the development of position-specific interventions aimed at reducing HAE exposure.</description>

      <title>Finer-Focused Partial Wave Spectroscopy (ff-PWS) and Detection of Cancer Stages From Human Tissue Samples</title>

Abstract: The progression of cancer is associated with different genetic and epigenetic events which result in nano to microscale structural alterations in cells/tissue. However, these structural alterations in the early stage of the disease remain undetectable by conventional microscopy due to the diffraction-limited resolution of ~200nm. With cancer being an epidemic worldwide, early and accurate detection methods are always in demand. In this sense, we developed a finer focusing mesoscopic physics-based partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) imaging and quantification technique, which can probe the precise scattering volume in cells/tissue to detect such structural alterations. Therefore, we employ the highly sensitive PWS technique to quantify the nanoscale refractive index fluctuations using commercially available paraffin embedded tissue microarrays (TMA) samples with the goal of the standardized early and accurate detection of stages of different cancers. Recently the use of scientific TMA samples has gained research interest in diagnosing different diseases and drug-effect in treatment since they are commercially easily accessible. In this work, deadly cancer such as pancreatic, prostate, breast, and colon cancer TMAs containing multiple cores of different stages for each cancer are analyzed using the PWS technique and the degree of disorder strength Ld was quantified. The finer focusing PWS results show that an increase in the disorder strength with the increase in the stage of each cancer. This quantitative analysis of different cancer stages using commercially available TMA samples could enhance and standardize early, accurate cancer diagnosis modalities.</description>

      <title>A Finite Element Analysis Model for Magnetomotive Ultrasound Elastometry Magnet Design with Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetomotive ultrasound (MMUS) using magnetic nanoparticle contrast agents has shown promise for thrombosis imaging and quantitative elastometry via magnetomotive resonant acoustic spectroscopy (MRAS). Young's modulus measurements of smaller, stiffer thrombi require an MRAS system capable of generating forces at higher temporal frequencies. Solenoids with fewer turns, and thus less inductance, could improve high frequency performance, but the reduced force may compromise results. In this work, a computational model capable of assessing the effectiveness of MRAS elastometry magnet configurations is presented and validated. Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to model the force and inductance of MRAS systems. The simulations incorporated both solenoid electromagnets and permanent magnets in three-dimensional steady-state, frequency domain, and time domain studies. The model successfully predicted that a configuration in which permanent magnets were added to an existing MRAS system could be used to increase the force supplied. Accordingly, the displacement measured in a magnetically labeled validation phantom increased by a factor of $2.2 \pm 0.3$ when the force was predicted to increase by a factor of $2.2 \pm 0.2$. The model additionally identified a new solenoid configuration consisting of four smaller coils capable of providing sufficient force at higher driving frequencies. These results indicate two methods by which MRAS systems could be designed to deliver higher frequency magnetic forces without the need for experimental trial and error. Either the number of turns within each solenoid could be reduced while permanent magnets are added at precise locations, or a larger number of smaller solenoids could be used. These findings overcome a key challenge toward the goal of MMUS thrombosis elastometry, and simulation files are provided online for broader experimentation.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, yet the physical or biological nature of the target remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domain (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model taking into account the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, we calculated the incidence of each DSB case across a variety of radiation doses and linear energy transfers (LETs). Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 vs LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects of high LET irradiation. Our study underscores the crucial significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis proposed in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for the establishment of mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different LETs.</description>

      <title>Muscle Activation Estimation by Optimizing the Musculoskeletal Model for Personalized Strength and Conditioning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal models are pivotal in the domains of rehabilitation and resistance training to analyze muscle conditions. However, individual variability in musculoskeletal parameters and the immeasurability of some internal biomechanical variables pose significant obstacles to accurate personalized modelling. Furthermore, muscle activation estimation can be challenging due to the inherent redundancy of the musculoskeletal system, where multiple muscles drive a single joint. This study develops a whole-body musculoskeletal model for strength and conditioning training and calibrates relevant muscle parameters with an electromyography-based optimization method. By utilizing the personalized musculoskeletal model, muscle activation can be subsequently estimated to analyze the performance of exercises. Bench press and deadlift are chosen for experimental verification to affirm the efficacy of this approach.</description>
