      <title>Internal null controllability for the one-dimensional heat equation with dynamic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary focus of this paper is to establish the internal null controllability for the one-dimensional heat equation featuring dynamic boundary conditions. This achievement is realized by introducing a new Carleman estimate and an observability inequality for the corresponding backward system. In conclusion, the paper includes a set of numerical experiments that serve to confirm the validity of the theoretical findings and underscore the effectiveness of the designed control with a minimal L2-norm.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of Mean field Control based Barycenters from Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a class of barycenter problems based on mean field control problems in three dimensions with associated reactive-diffusion systems of unnormalized multi-species densities. This problem is the generalization of the Wasserstein barycenter problem for single probability density functions. The primary objective is to present a comprehensive framework for efficiently computing the proposed variational problem: generalized Benamou-Brenier formulas with multiple input density vectors as boundary conditions. Our approach involves the utilization of high-order finite element discretizations of the spacetime domain to achieve improved accuracy. The discrete optimization problem is then solved using the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, a first-order optimization method for effectively addressing a wide range of constrained optimization problems. The efficacy and robustness of our proposed framework are illustrated through several numerical examples in three dimensions, such as the computation of the barycenter of multi-density systems consisting of Gaussian distributions and reactive-diffusive multi-density systems involving 3D voxel densities. Additional examples highlighting computations on 2D embedded surfaces are also provided.</description>

      <title>Identification of High-dimensional ARMA Models with Binary-Valued Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies system identification of high-dimensional ARMA models with binary-valued observations. Compared with existing quantized identification of ARMA models, this problem is more challenging since the accessible information is much less. Different from the identification of FIR models with binary-valued observations, the prediction of original system output and the parameter both need to be estimated in ARMA models. We propose an online identification algorithm consisting of parameter estimation and prediction of original system output. The parameter estimation and the prediction of original output are strongly coupled but mutually reinforcing. By analyzing the two estimates at the same time instead of analyzing separately, we finally prove that the parameter estimate can converge to the true parameter with convergence rate $O(1/k)$ under certain conditions. Simulations are given to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Coefficient control of the regularized p-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheet simulation is challenging due to unknown parameters in the p-Stokes equations. In this work, we prove the existence of a solution to a parameter identification for the ice rheology and the friction coefficient. Additionally, we verify G\^ateaux differentiability of the control-to-state operator by extending a similar result for distributed control. Moreover, we have more complicated boundary conditions. We only have to add a small diffusion term and assume the nonlinear exponent, which is given in applications, to be small enough to obtain the results. Finally, we state the adjoint equation and prove existence and uniqueness of a solution for this equation.</description>

      <title>Solving a Class of Nonconvex Quadratic Programs by Inertial DC Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two inertial DC algorithms for indefinite quadratic programs under linear constraints (IQPs) are considered in this paper. Using a qualification condition related to the normal cones of unbounded pseudo-faces of the polyhedral convex constraint set, the recession cones of the corresponding faces, and the quadratic form describing the objective function, we prove that the iteration sequences in question are bounded if the given IQP has a finite optimal value. Any cluster point of such a sequence is a KKT point. The convergence of the members of a DCA sequence produced by one of the two inertial algorithms to just one connected component of the KKT point set is also obtained. To do so, we revisit the inertial algorithm for DC programming of de Oliveira and Tcheou [de Oliveira, W., Tcheou, M.P.: An inertial algorithm for DC programming, Set-Valued and Variational Analysis 2019; 27: 895--919] and give a refined version of Theorem 1 from that paper, which can be used for IQPs with unbounded constraint sets. An illustrative example is proposed.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Control Lyapunov-Value Functions for High-Dimensional Systems Using System Decomposition and Admissible Control Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) play a vital role in modern control applications, but finding them remains a problem. Recently, the control Lyapunov-value function (CLVF) and robust CLVF have been proposed as solutions for nonlinear time-invariant systems with bounded control and disturbance. However, the CLVF suffers from the ''curse of dimensionality,'' which hinders its application to practical high-dimensional systems. In this paper, we propose a method to decompose systems of a particular coupled nonlinear structure, in order to solve for the CLVF in each low-dimensional subsystem. We then reconstruct the full-dimensional CLVF and provide sufficient conditions for when this reconstruction is exact. Moreover, a point-wise optimal controller can be obtained using a quadratic program. We also show that when the exact reconstruction is impossible, the subsystems' CLVFs and their ``admissible control sets'' can be used to generate a Lipschitz continuous CLF. We provide several numerical examples to validate the theory and show computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A zonogon approach for computing small polygons of maximum perimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation for the problem of finding a convex polygon with a given number of vertices that is small (diameter at most one) and has maximum perimeter. The formulation is based on a geometric construction using zonogons. The resulting zonogons can be characterized by an integer code and we study the number of codes that are distinct under the symmetries of the problem. We propose a two-phase computational approach. Phase I comprises the solution of a purely combinatorial problem. Under assumption of Mossinghoff's conjecture, the Phase I problem can be reduced to a Subset-Sum Problem. Without Mossinghoff's conjecture, a generalized Subset-Sum Problem needs to be solved, which consists of picking $n$ non-opposing $2n$-th roots of unity such that their sum is as small as possible. Phase II consists of a non-combinatorial Nonlinear Programming Problem, which can be solved to high accuracy with arbitrary precision Newton-type methods. We provide extensive numerical results including highly accurate solutions for polygons with 64 and 128 vertices.</description>

      <title>Damage Location in Mechanical Structures by Multi-Objective Pattern Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-objective global pattern search algorithm for the task of locating and quantifying damage in flexible mechanical structures. This is achieved by identifying eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes from measurements and matching them against the results of a finite element simulation model, which leads to a nonsmooth nonlinear bi-objective parameter estimation problem. A derivative-free optimization algorithm is required since the problem is nonsmooth and also because complex mechanical simulation models are often solved using commercial black-box software. Moreover, the entire set of non-dominated solutions is of interest to practitioners. Most solution approaches published to date are based on meta-heuristics such as genetic algorithms. The proposed multi-objective pattern-search algorithm provides a mathematically well-founded alternative. It features a novel sorting procedure that reduces the complexity in our context. Test runs on two experimental structures with multiple damage scenarios are used to validate the approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields accurate damage locations and requires moderate computational resources. From the engineer's perspective it represents a promising tool for structural health monitoring.</description>

      <title>An MILP-Based Solution Scheme for Factored and Robust Factored Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factored Markov decision processes (MDPs) are a prominent paradigm within the artificial intelligence community for modeling and solving large-scale MDPs whose rewards and dynamics decompose into smaller, loosely interacting components. Through the use of dynamic Bayesian networks and context-specific independence, factored MDPs can achieve an exponential reduction in the state space of an MDP and thus scale to problem sizes that are beyond the reach of classical MDP algorithms. However, factored MDPs are typically solved using custom-designed algorithms that can require meticulous implementations and considerable fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a mathematical programming approach to solving factored MDPs. In contrast to existing solution schemes, our approach leverages off-the-shelf solvers, which allows for a streamlined implementation and maintenance; it effectively capitalizes on the factored structure present in both state and action spaces; and it readily extends to the largely unexplored class of robust factored MDPs, whose transition kernels are only known to reside in a pre-specified ambiguity set. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of our approach.</description>

      <title>Using the Empirical Attainment Function for Analyzing Single-objective Black-box Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A widely accepted way to assess the performance of iterative black-box optimizers is to analyze their empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of pre-defined quality targets achieved not later than a given runtime. In this work, we consider an alternative approach, based on the empirical attainment function (EAF) and we show that the target-based ECDF is an approximation of the EAF. We argue that the EAF has several advantages over the target-based ECDF. In particular, it does not require defining a priori quality targets per function, captures performance differences more precisely, and enables the use of additional summary statistics that enrich the analysis. We also show that the average area over the convergence curves is a simpler-to-calculate, but equivalent, measure of anytime performance. To facilitate the accessibility of the EAF, we integrate a module to compute it into the IOHanalyzer platform. Finally, we illustrate the use of the EAF via synthetic examples and via the data available for the BBOB suite.</description>

      <title>Generic Properties of Conjugate Points in Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first part of the paper studies a class of optimal control problems in Bolza form, where the dynamics is linear w.r.t.~the control function. A necessary condition is derived, for the optimality of a trajectory which starts at a conjugate point. The second part is concerned with a classical problem in the Calculus of Variations, with free terminal point. For a generic terminal cost $\psi\in \C^4(\mathbb{R}^n)$, applying the previous necessary condition we show that the set of conjugate points is contained in the image of an $(n-2)$-dimensional manifold, and has locally bounded $(n-2)$-dimensional Hausdorff measure.</description>

      <title>Convex relaxation for the generalized maximum-entropy sampling problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized maximum-entropy sampling problem (GMESP) is to select an order-$s$ principal submatrix from an order-$n$ covariance matrix, to maximize the product of its $t$ greatest eigenvalues, $0&lt;t\leq s &lt;n$. It is a problem that specializes to two fundamental problems in statistical design theory:(i) maximum-entropy sampling problem (MESP); (ii) binary D-optimality (D-Opt). In the general case, it is motivated by a selection problem in the context of PCA (principal component analysis).
  We introduce the first convex-optimization based relaxation for GMESP, study its behavior, compare it to an earlier spectral bound, and demonstrate its use in a branch-and-bound scheme. We find that such an approach is practical when $s-t$ is very small.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and Adam in Generalized-smooth Non-convex Optimization with Affine Noise Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides the first tight convergence analyses for RMSProp and Adam in non-convex optimization under the most relaxed assumptions of coordinate-wise generalized smoothness and affine noise variance. We first analyze RMSProp, which is a special case of Adam with adaptive learning rates but without first-order momentum. Specifically, to solve the challenges due to dependence among adaptive update, unbounded gradient estimate and Lipschitz constant, we demonstrate that the first-order term in the descent lemma converges and its denominator is upper bounded by a function of gradient norm. Based on this result, we show that RMSProp with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. We then generalize our analysis to Adam, where the additional challenge is due to a mismatch between the gradient and first-order momentum. We develop a new upper bound on the first-order term in the descent lemma, which is also a function of the gradient norm. We show that Adam with proper hyperparameters converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point with an iteration complexity of $\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-4})$. Our complexity results for both RMSProp and Adam match with the complexity lower bound established in \cite{arjevani2023lower}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence, uniqueness, and $W^{1,2,p}$-regularity of solutions to fully nonlinear parabolic obstacle problems when the obstacle is the pointwise supremum of arbitrary functions in $W^{1,2,p}$ and the operator is only assumed to be measurable in the state and time variables. The results hold for a large class of non-smooth obstacles, including all convex obstacles. Applied to stopping problems, they imply that the decision maker never stops at a convex kink of the stopping payoff. The proof relies on new $W^{1,2,p}$-estimates for obstacle problems where the obstacle is the maximum of finitely many functions in $W^{1,2,p}$.</description>

      <title>Perfecting Periodic Trajectory Tracking: Model Predictive Control with a Periodic Observer ($\Pi$-MPC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Model Predictive Control (MPC), discrepancies between the actual system and the predictive model can lead to substantial tracking errors and significantly degrade performance and reliability. While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</description>

      <title>Conjugate-Gradient-like Based Adaptive Moment Estimation Optimization Algorithm for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks is a challenging task. In order to speed up training and enhance the performance of deep neural networks, we rectify the vanilla conjugate gradient as conjugate-gradient-like and incorporate it into the generic Adam, and thus propose a new optimization algorithm named CG-like-Adam for deep learning. Specifically, both the first-order and the second-order moment estimation of generic Adam are replaced by the conjugate-gradient-like. Convergence analysis handles the cases where the exponential moving average coefficient of the first-order moment estimation is constant and the first-order moment estimation is unbiased. Numerical experiments show the superiority of the proposed algorithm based on the CIFAR10/100 dataset.</description>

      <title>A neural network-based approach to hybrid systems identification for control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a machine learning-based model of an unknown dynamical system from a finite number of (state-input)-successor state data points, such that the model obtained is also suitable for optimal control design. We propose a specific neural network (NN) architecture that yields a hybrid system with piecewise-affine dynamics that is differentiable with respect to the network's parameters, thereby enabling the use of derivative-based training procedures. We show that a careful choice of our NN's weights produces a hybrid system model with structural properties that are highly favourable when used as part of a finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP). Specifically, we show that optimal solutions with strong local optimality guarantees can be computed via nonlinear programming, in contrast to classical OCPs for general hybrid systems which typically require mixed-integer optimization. In addition to being well-suited for optimal control design, numerical simulations illustrate that our NN-based technique enjoys very similar performance to state-of-the-art system identification methodologies for hybrid systems and it is competitive on nonlinear benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Renewable Energy Expansion under Taxes and Subsidies: A Transmission Operator's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10562v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of a transmission system operator within a carbon footprint reduction strategy incorporating carbon taxes and renewable energy generation subsidies in the decentralised energy market. This is achieved via an optimisation bi-level model in which a welfare-maximizing transmission system operator makes investments in transmission lines at the upper level while considering power market dynamics at the lower level. To account for the deregulated energy market structure, this paper assumes that the generation companies at the lower level make capacity investments as price-takers in perfect competition. Considering alternative transmission infrastructure expansion budgets, carbon emission taxes and monetary incentives for renewable energy generation capacity expansion, the impact of alternative compositions of these factors is analysed against three output factors: the share of renewable energy in the generation mix, total generation amount, and social welfare. The proposed modelling assessment is applied to an illustrative three-node instance and a case study considering a simplified representation of the energy system of the Nordic and Baltic countries. The results highlight that, under certain circumstances, renewable energy generation subsidies may lead to an increase of renewable energy in the generation mix followed by a simultaneous fall in the total generation amount. Nevertheless, when applied together, these three measures demonstrated a positive impact on all output factors within Nordics' and Baltics' energy systems. The experiments additionally suggest that considering the high value of the carbon tax does not have an impact on the output factors while the composition of high values of renewable energy generation subsidies and budget for transmission infrastructure expansion has the strongest effect.</description>

      <title>Parameter-free Maximum Likelihood Localization of a Network of Moving Agents from Ranges, Bearings and Velocity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization is a fundamental enabler technology for many applications, like vehicular networks, IoT, and even medicine. While Global Navigation Satellite Systems solutions offer great performance, they are unavailable in scenarios like indoor or underwater environments, and, for large networks, the instrumentation cost is prohibitive. We develop a localization algorithm from ranges and bearings, suitable for generic mobile networks. Our algorithm is built on a tight convex relaxation of the Maximum Likelihood position estimator. To serve positioning to mobile agents, a horizon-based version is developed accounting for velocity measurements at each agent. To solve the convex problem, a distributed gradient-based method is provided. This constitutes an advantage over centralized approaches, which usually exhibit high latency for large networks and present a single point of failure. Additionally, the algorithm estimates all required parameters and effectively becomes parameter-free. Our solution to the dynamic network localization problem is theoretically well-founded and still easy to understand. We obtain a parameter-free, outlier-robust and trajectory-agnostic algorithm, with nearly constant positioning error regardless of the trajectories of agents and anchors, achieving better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, as our simulations show. Furthermore, the method is distributed, convex and does not require any particular anchor configuration.</description>

      <title>SOStab: a Matlab Toolbox for Transient Stability Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new Matlab toolbox, aimed at facilitating the use of polynomial optimization for stability analysis of nonlinear systems. In the past decade several decisive contributions made it possible to recast this type of problems as convex optimization ones that are tractable in modest dimensions. However, available software requires their user to be fluent in Sum-of-Squares programming, preventing them from being more widely explored by practitioners. To address this issue, SOStab entirely automates the writing and solving of optimization problems, and directly outputs relevant data for the user, while requiring minimal input. In particular, no specific knowledge of optimization is needed for implementation. The toolbox allows a user to obtain outer and inner approximates of the \ac{roa} of the operating point of different grid connected devices such as synchronous machines and power converters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12626v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The best-worst method is an increasingly popular approach to solve multi-criteria decision-making problems. However, the usual prioritisation techniques may result in ordinal violations if the best (worst) alternative identified in an early step does not receive the highest (lowest) weight in a later step. The current paper gives two sufficient conditions for the logarithmic least squares method, applied to the implied incomplete best-worst method matrix, to guarantee the lack of ordinal violations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a multilevel framework for inertial and inexact proximal algorithms, that encompasses multilevel versions of classical algorithms such as forward-backward and FISTA.  The methods are supported by strong theoretical guarantees: we prove both the rate of convergence and the convergence of the iterates to a minimum in the convex case, an important result for ill-posed problems. We propose a particular instance of IML (Inexact MultiLevel) FISTA, based on the use of the Moreau envelope to build efficient and useful coarse corrections, fully adapted to solve problems in image restoration. Such a construction is derived for a broad class of composite optimization problems with proximable functions. We evaluate our approach on several image reconstruction problems and we show that it considerably accelerates the convergence of the corresponding one-level (i.e. standard) version of the methods, for large-scale images.</description>

Abstract: We extend the polynomial Pell's equation satisfied by univariate Chebyshev polynomials on [--1, 1] from one variable to several variables, using orthogonal polynomials on regular domains that include cubes, balls, and simplexes of arbitrary dimension. Moreover, we show that such an equation is strongly connected (i) to a certificate of positivity (from real algebraic geometry) on the domain, as well as (ii) to the Christoffel functions of the equilibrium measure on the domain. In addition, the solution to Pell's equation reflects an extremal property of orthonormal polynomials associated with an entropy-like criterion.</description>

      <title>Assortment Optimization with Visibility Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in e-retail and online advertising, we study the problem of assortment optimization under visibility constraints, that we refer to as APV. We are given a universe of substitutable products and a stream of T customers. The objective is to determine the optimal assortment of products to offer to each customer in order to maximize the total expected revenue, subject to the constraint that each product is required to be shown to a minimum number of customers. The minimum display requirement for each product is given exogenously and we refer to these constraints as visibility constraints. We assume that customer choices follow a Multinomial Logit model (MNL). We provide a characterization of the structure of the optimal assortments and present an efficient polynomial time algorithm for solving APV. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel function called the ``expanded revenue" of an assortment and establish its supermodularity. Our algorithm takes advantage of this structural property. Additionally, we demonstrate that APV can be formulated as a compact linear program. Next, we consider APV with cardinality constraints, which we prove to be strongly NP-hard and not admitting a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS), even in the special case where all the products have identical prices. Subsequently, we devise a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for APV under cardinality constraints with identical prices. Our algorithm starts by linearizing the objective function through a carefully crafted guessing procedure, then solves the linearized program, and finally randomly rounds the obtained solution to derive a near optimal solution. We also examine the revenue loss resulting from the enforcement of visibility constraints, comparing it to the unconstrained version of the problem and propose a novel strategy to offset the loss.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Federated Methods for Stochastic MPECs and Nondifferentiable Nonconvex Hierarchical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the emergence of federated learning (FL), we design and analyze federated methods for addressing: (i) Nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization; (ii) Bilevel optimization; (iii) Minimax problems; and (iv) Two-stage stochastic mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints (2s-SMPEC). Research on these problems has been limited and afflicted by reliance on strong assumptions, including the need for differentiability of the implicit function and the absence of constraints in the lower-level problem, among others. We make the following contributions. In (i), by leveraging convolution-based smoothing and Clarke's subdifferential calculus, we devise a randomized smoothing-enabled zeroth-order FL method and derive communication and iteration complexity guarantees for computing an approximate Clarke stationary point. To contend with (ii) and (iii), we devise a unifying randomized implicit zeroth-order FL framework, equipped with explicit communication and iteration complexities. Importantly, our method utilizes delays during local steps to skip calls to the inexact lower-level FL oracle. This results in significant reduction in communication overhead. In (iv), we devise an inexact implicit variant of the method in (i). Remarkably, this method achieves a total communication complexity matching that of single-level nonsmooth nonconvex optimization in FL. We empirically validate the theoretical findings on instances of federated nonsmooth and hierarchical problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions derived from high-order control barrier functions. We provide conditions under which a swarm is guaranteed to achieve collective safety with respect to multiple obstacles using a modified collaborative safety algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our distributed algorithm via simulation in a simplified physics-based environment.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Adaptivity Gaps and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the challenge of choice congestion in matching markets, in this work, we introduce a two-sided assortment optimization framework under general choice preferences. The goal in this problem is to maximize the expected number of matches by deciding which assortments are displayed to the agents and the order in which they are shown. In this context, we identify several classes of policies that platforms can use in their design. Our goals are: (1) to measure the value that one class of policies has over another one, and (2) to approximately solve the optimization problem itself for a given class. For (1), we define the adaptivity gap as the worst-case ratio between the optimal values of two different policy classes. First, we show that the gap between the class of policies that statically show assortments to one-side first and the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to one-side first is exactly $1-1/e$. Second, we show that the gap between the latter class of policies and the fully adaptive class of policies that show assortments to agents one by one is exactly $1/2$. We also note that the worst policies are those who simultaneously show assortments to all the agents, in fact, we show that their adaptivity gap even with respect to one-sided static policies can be arbitrarily small. For (2), we first show that there exists a polynomial time policy that achieves a $1/4$ approximation factor within the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to agents one by one. Finally, when agents' preferences are governed by multinomial-logit models, we show that a 0.066 approximation factor can be obtained within the class of policies that show assortments to all agents at once.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers gradient descent for L-smooth convex optimization with stepsizes larger than the classic regime where descent can be ensured. The stepsize schedules considered are similar to but differ slightly from the concurrently developed silver stepsizes of Altschuler and Parillo. For one of our stepsize sequences, we prove a $O\left(\frac{1}{N^{1.2716\dots}}\right)$ convergence rate in terms of objective gap decrease and for the other, we show the same rate of decrease for the squared-gradient-norm. This first result improves on the recent result of Altschuler and Parillo by a constant factor, while the second results improve on the exponent of the prior best squared-gradient-norm convergence guarantee of $O(\frac{1}{N})$.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding approximate Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is explicitly identified in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. This is achieved by introducing a suitable linear derivative of the value functions with respect to unilateral deviations of strategies and via analyzing the sensitivity processes of state dynamics with respect to controls.
  For games with mean-field type interactions, $\alpha$ is shown to decay to zero as the number of players goes to infinity, even with heterogeneity in state dynamics, cost functions, and admissible strategy classes. For distributed games, if a static potential function can be derived from the cost functions, then $\alpha=0$. For crowd aversion games, $\alpha$ is capable of capturing the subtle difference between the choice of admissible strategies.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback Synthesis Orbit Geometry: Quotient Manifolds and LQG Direct Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider direct policy optimization for the linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. Over the past few years, it has been recognized that the landscape of stabilizing output-feedback controllers of relevance to LQG has an intricate geometry, particularly as it pertains to the existence of spurious stationary points. In order to address such challenges, in this paper, we first adopt a Riemannian metric for the space of stabilizing full-order minimal output-feedback controllers. We then proceed to prove that the orbit space of such controllers modulo coordinate transformation admits a Riemannian quotient manifold structure. This geometric structure is then used to develop a Riemannian gradient descent for the direct LQG policy optimization. We prove a local convergence guarantee with linear rate and show the proposed approach exhibits significantly faster and more robust numerical performance as compared with ordinary gradient descent for LQG. Subsequently, we provide reasons for this observed behavior; in particular, we argue that optimizing over the orbit space of controllers is the right theoretical and computational setup for direct LQG policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Sequential Decision-Making under Uncertainty: A Robust MDPs review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review paper provides an in-depth overview of the evolution and advancements in Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs), a field of paramount importance for its role in sequential decision-making amidst uncertainty. Fueled by advances in robust optimization theory and the increasing applications of reinforcement learning techniques, RMDPs literature has been enriched extensively. The review focuses on the formulation of RMDPs, particularly ambiguity sets modeling, which is central to hedging uncertainty. The review systematically classifies the extant methodologies for RMDP formulation into three principal categories: parametric, moment-based, and discrepancy-based approaches, and comprehensively dissects them. The review further delves into the rectangular assumption, which is essential for the computational tractability of RMDPs yet noted for its potential to engender overly conservative policy outcomes. The review summarizes three popular rectangular forms and presents new proof attesting to the NP-hardness of non-rectangular RMDPs. Out of traditional RMDPs scope, the review also surveys recent efforts without conventional rectangular assumptions and burgeoning research trends within the RMDP community. These studies foster the development of more flexible and practical modeling frameworks and enhance the adaptability and performance of RMDPs in the face of uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: We construct so-called Darboux transformations and solutions of the dynamical Hamiltonian systems with several space variables $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=\sum_{k=1}^r H_k(t)\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \zeta_k}\,$ $( H_k(t)= H_k(t)^*)$. In particular, such systems are analogs of the port-Hamiltonian systems in the important and insufficiently studied case of several space variables. The corresponding energy relations are written down. The method is illustrated by several examples, where explicit solutions are given.</description>

Abstract: Given a matrix $M\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, the low rank matrix completion problem asks us to find a rank-$k$ approximation of $M$ as $UV^\top$ for $U\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times k}$ and $V\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times k}$ by only observing a few entries specified by a set of entries $\Omega\subseteq [m]\times [n]$. In particular, we examine an approach that is widely used in practice -- the alternating minimization framework. Jain, Netrapalli, and Sanghavi [JNS13] showed that if $M$ has incoherent rows and columns, then alternating minimization provably recovers the matrix $M$ by observing a nearly linear in $n$ number of entries. While the sample complexity has been subsequently improved [GLZ17], alternating minimization steps are required to be computed exactly. This hinders the development of more efficient algorithms and fails to depict the practical implementation of alternating minimization, where the updates are usually performed approximately in favor of efficiency.
  In this paper, we take a major step towards a more efficient and error-robust alternating minimization framework. To this end, we develop an analytical framework for alternating minimization that can tolerate a moderate amount of errors caused by approximate updates. Moreover, our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde O(|\Omega| k)$, which is nearly linear in the time to verify the solution while preserving the sample complexity. This improves upon all prior known alternating minimization approaches which require $\widetilde O(|\Omega| k^2)$ time.</description>

      <title>Singular Control of (Reflected) Brownian Motion: A Computational Method Suitable for Queueing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11823</link>

Abstract: Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a class of singular stochastic control problems whose state space is the d-dimensional positive orthant. The original problem is approximated by a drift control problem, to which we apply a recently developed computational method that is feasible for dimensions up to d=30 or more. To show that nearly optimal solutions are obtainable using this method, we present computational results for a variety of examples, including queueing network examples that have appeared previously in the literature.</description>

      <title>Online Uniform Risk Times Sampling: First Approximation Algorithms, Learning Augmentation with Full Confidence Interval Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In digital health, the strategy of allocating a limited treatment budget across risk times is crucial to reduce user fatigue. This strategy, however, encounters a significant obstacle due to the unknown actual number of risk times, a factor not adequately addressed by existing methods lacking theoretical guarantees. This paper introduces, for the first time, the online uniform risk times sampling problem within the approximation algorithm framework. We propose two online approximation algorithms for this problem, one with and one without learning augmentation, and provide rigorous theoretical performance guarantees for them using competitive ratio analysis. We assess the performance of our algorithms using both synthetic experiments and a real-world case study on HeartSteps mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Online Local False Discovery Rate Control: A Resource Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially conducting multiple experiments where each experiment corresponds to a hypothesis testing task. At each time point, the experimenter must make an irrevocable decision of whether to reject the null hypothesis (or equivalently claim a discovery) before the next experimental result arrives. The goal is to maximize the number of discoveries while maintaining a low error rate at all time points measured by local False Discovery Rate (FDR). We formulate the problem as an online knapsack problem with exogenous random budget replenishment. We start with general arrival distributions and show that a simple policy achieves a $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. We complement the result by showing that such regret rate is in general not improvable. We then shift our focus to discrete arrival distributions. We find that many existing re-solving heuristics in the online resource allocation literature, albeit achieve bounded loss in canonical settings, may incur a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even a $\Omega(T)$ regret. With the observation that canonical policies tend to be too optimistic and over claim discoveries, we propose a novel policy that incorporates budget safety buffers. It turns out that a little more safety can greatly enhance efficiency -- small additional logarithmic buffers suffice to reduce the regret from $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ or even $\Omega(T)$ to $O(\ln^2 T)$. From a practical perspective, we extend the policy to the scenario with continuous arrival distributions as well as time-dependent information structures. We conduct both synthetic experiments and empirical applications on a time series data from New York City taxi passengers to validate the performance of our proposed policies. Our results emphasize how effective policies should be designed in online resource allocation problems with exogenous budget replenishment.</description>
