      <title>CPLIP: Zero-Shot Learning for Histopathology with Comprehensive Vision-Language Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Comprehensive Pathology Language Image Pre-training (CPLIP), a new unsupervised technique designed to enhance the alignment of images and text in histopathology for tasks such as classification and segmentation. This methodology enriches vision-language models by leveraging extensive data without needing ground truth annotations. CPLIP involves constructing a pathology-specific dictionary, generating textual descriptions for images using language models, and retrieving relevant images for each text snippet via a pre-trained model. The model is then fine-tuned using a many-to-many contrastive learning method to align complex interrelated concepts across both modalities. Evaluated across multiple histopathology tasks, CPLIP shows notable improvements in zero-shot learning scenarios, outperforming existing methods in both interpretability and robustness and setting a higher benchmark for the application of vision-language models in the field. To encourage further research and replication, the code for CPLIP is available on GitHub at https://cplip.github.io/</description>

      <title>YouTube SFV+HDR Quality Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of Short form videos (SFV) has grown dramatically in the past few years, and has become a phenomenal video category with billions of viewers. Meanwhile, High Dynamic Range (HDR) as an advanced feature also becomes more and more popular on video sharing platforms. As a hot topic with huge impact, SFV and HDR bring new questions to video quality research: 1) is SFV+HDR quality assessment significantly different from traditional User Generated Content (UGC) quality assessment? 2) do objective quality metrics designed for traditional UGC still work well for SFV+HDR? To answer the above questions, we created the first large scale SFV+HDR dataset with reliable subjective quality scores, covering 10 popular content categories. Further, we also introduce a general sampling framework to maximize the representativeness of the dataset. We provided a comprehensive analysis of subjective quality scores for Short form SDR and HDR videos, and discuss the reliability of state-of-the-art UGC quality metrics and potential improvements.</description>

      <title>Discover Your Neighbors: Advanced Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for multimedia applications. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test distributions within batches. This work provides a new perspective on analyzing batch normalization techniques through class-related and class-irrelevant features, our observations reveal combining source and test batch normalization statistics robustly characterizes target distributions. However, test statistics must have high similarity. We thus propose Discover Your Neighbours (DYN), the first backward-free approach specialized for dynamic TTA. The core innovation is identifying similar samples via instance normalization statistics and clustering into groups which provides consistent class-irrelevant representations. Specifically, Our DYN consists of layer-wise instance statistics clustering (LISC) and cluster-aware batch normalization (CABN). In LISC, we perform layer-wise clustering of approximate feature samples at each BN layer by calculating the cosine similarity of instance normalization statistics across the batch. CABN then aggregates SBN and TCN statistics to collaboratively characterize the target distribution, enabling more robust representations. Experimental results validate DYN's robustness and effectiveness, demonstrating maintained performance under dynamic data stream patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent rapid development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has indicated their potential for embodied tasks.However, the critical skill of spatial understanding in embodied environments has not been thoroughly evaluated, leaving the gap between current LVLMs and qualified embodied intelligence unknown. Therefore, we construct EmbSpatial-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating embodied spatial understanding of LVLMs.The benchmark is automatically derived from embodied scenes and covers 6 spatial relationships from an egocentric perspective.Experiments expose the insufficient capacity of current LVLMs (even GPT-4V). We further present EmbSpatial-SFT, an instruction-tuning dataset designed to improve LVLMs' embodied spatial understanding.</description>

      <title>Unified Text-to-Image Generation and Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How humans can efficiently and effectively acquire images has always been a perennial question. A typical solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database given the text query; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce fancy and diverse visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval and propose a unified framework in the context of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of MLLMs and introduce a generative retrieval method to perform retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval in an autoregressive generation way and propose an autonomous decision module to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text query. Additionally, we construct a benchmark called TIGeR-Bench, including creative and knowledge-intensive domains, to standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval. Extensive experimental results on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Latent Representation Tuning for Image-text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large models have demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities in computer vision and natural language processing. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing these models with multimodal processing abilities. However, addressing the challenges posed by scenarios where one modality is absent remains a significant hurdle. In response to this issue, we propose a robust latent representation tuning method for large models. Specifically, our approach introduces a modality latent translation module to maximize the correlation between modalities. Following this, a newly designed fusion module is employed to facilitate information interaction between the modalities. In this framework, not only are common semantics refined during training, but the method also yields robust representations in the absence of one modality. Importantly, our method maintains the frozen state of the image and text foundation models to preserve their abilities acquired through large-scale pretraining. We conduct experiments on several public datasets, and the results underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Modeling Reshapes Compression and Transmission: From Efficiency to Resiliency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information theory and machine learning are inextricably linked and have even been referred to as "two sides of the same coin". One particularly elegant connection is the essential equivalence between probabilistic generative modeling and data compression or transmission. In this article, we reveal the dual-functionality of deep generative models that reshapes both data compression for efficiency and transmission error concealment for resiliency. We present how the contextual predictive capabilities of powerful generative models can be well positioned to be strong compressors and estimators. In this sense, we advocate for viewing the deep generative modeling problem through the lens of end-to-end communications, and evaluate the compression and error restoration capabilities of foundation generative models. We show that the kernel of many large generative models is powerful predictor that can capture complex relationships among semantic latent variables, and the communication viewpoints provide novel insights into semantic feature tokenization, contextual learning, and usage of deep generative models. In summary, our article highlights the essential connections of generative AI to source and channel coding techniques, and motivates researchers to make further explorations in this emerging topic.</description>

      <title>AID: Adapting Image2Video Diffusion Models for Instruction-guided Video Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-guided video prediction (TVP) involves predicting the motion of future frames from the initial frame according to an instruction, which has wide applications in virtual reality, robotics, and content creation. Previous TVP methods make significant breakthroughs by adapting Stable Diffusion for this task. However, they struggle with frame consistency and temporal stability primarily due to the limited scale of video datasets. We observe that pretrained Image2Video diffusion models possess good priors for video dynamics but they lack textual control. Hence, transferring Image2Video models to leverage their video dynamic priors while injecting instruction control to generate controllable videos is both a meaningful and challenging task. To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to predict future video states based on initial frames and text instructions. More specifically, we design a dual query transformer (DQFormer) architecture, which integrates the instructions and frames into the conditional embeddings for future frame prediction. Additionally, we develop Long-Short Term Temporal Adapters and Spatial Adapters that can quickly transfer general video diffusion models to specific scenarios with minimal training costs. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets: Something Something V2, Epic Kitchen-100, Bridge Data, and UCF-101. Notably, AID achieves 91.2% and 55.5% FVD improvements on Bridge and SSv2 respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness in various domains.

      <title>Holistic Visual-Textual Sentiment Analysis with Prior Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual-textual sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiment with the input of a pair of image and text, which poses a challenge in learning effective features for diverse input images. To address this, we propose a holistic method that achieves robust visual-textual sentiment analysis by exploiting a rich set of powerful pre-trained visual and textual prior models. The proposed method consists of four parts: (1) a visual-textual branch to learn features directly from data for sentiment analysis, (2) a visual expert branch with a set of pre-trained "expert" encoders to extract selected semantic visual features, (3) a CLIP branch to implicitly model visual-textual correspondence, and (4) a multimodal feature fusion network based on BERT to fuse multimodal features and make sentiment predictions. Extensive experiments on three datasets show that our method produces better visual-textual sentiment analysis performance than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Looking Similar, Sounding Different: Leveraging Counterfactual Cross-Modal Pairs for Audiovisual Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audiovisual representation learning typically relies on the correspondence between sight and sound. However, there are often multiple audio tracks that can correspond with a visual scene. Consider, for example, different conversations on the same crowded street. The effect of such counterfactual pairs on audiovisual representation learning has not been previously explored. To investigate this, we use dubbed versions of movies and television shows to augment cross-modal contrastive learning. Our approach learns to represent alternate audio tracks, differing only in speech, similarly to the same video. Our results, from a comprehensive set of experiments investigating different training strategies, show this general approach improves performance on a range of downstream auditory and audiovisual tasks, without majorly affecting linguistic task performance overall. These findings highlight the importance of considering speech variation when learning scene-level audiovisual correspondences and suggest that dubbed audio can be a useful augmentation technique for training audiovisual models toward more robust performance on diverse downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Spoken Humanoid Embodied Conversational Agents in Mobile Serious Games: A Usability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an empirical investigation of the extent to which spoken Humanoid Embodied Conversational Agents (HECAs) can foster usability in mobile serious game (MSG) applications. The aim of the research is to assess the impact of multiple agents and illusion of humanness on the quality of the interaction. The experiment investigates two styles of agent presentation: an agent of high human-likeness (HECA) and an agent of low human-likeness (text). The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether and how agents of high humanlikeness can evoke the illusion of humanness and affect usability. Agents of high human-likeness were designed by following the ECA design model that is a proposed guide for ECA development. The results of the experiment with 90 participants show that users prefer to interact with the HECAs. The difference between the two versions is statistically significant with a large effect size (d=1.01), with many of the participants justifying their choice by saying that the human-like characteristics of the HECA made the version more appealing. This research provides key information on the potential effect of HECAs on serious games, which can provide insight into the design of future mobile serious games.</description>

      <title>DARA: Domain- and Relation-aware Adapters Make Parameter-efficient Tuning for Visual Grounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) is a challenging task to localize an object in an image based on a textual description. Recent surge in the scale of VG models has substantially improved performance, but also introduced a significant burden on computational costs during fine-tuning. In this paper, we explore applying parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) to efficiently transfer the pre-trained vision-language knowledge to VG. Specifically, we propose \textbf{DARA}, a novel PETL method comprising \underline{\textbf{D}}omain-aware \underline{\textbf{A}}dapters (DA Adapters) and \underline{\textbf{R}}elation-aware \underline{\textbf{A}}dapters (RA Adapters) for VG. DA Adapters first transfer intra-modality representations to be more fine-grained for the VG domain. Then RA Adapters share weights to bridge the relation between two modalities, improving spatial reasoning. Empirical results on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that DARA achieves the best accuracy while saving numerous updated parameters compared to the full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. Notably, with only \textbf{2.13\%} tunable backbone parameters, DARA improves average accuracy by \textbf{0.81\%} across the three benchmarks compared to the baseline model. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/liuting20/DARA}.</description>

      <title>Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines Using Feature Fusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09152v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As image recognition models become more prevalent, scalable coding methods for machines and humans gain more importance. Applications of image recognition models include traffic monitoring and farm management. In these use cases, the scalable coding method proves effective because the tasks require occasional image checking by humans. Existing image compression methods for humans and machines meet these requirements to some extent. However, these compression methods are effective solely for specific image recognition models. We propose a learning-based scalable image coding method for humans and machines that is compatible with numerous image recognition models. We combine an image compression model for machines with a compression model, providing additional information to facilitate image decoding for humans. The features in these compression models are fused using a feature fusion network to achieve efficient image compression. Our method's additional information compression model is adjusted to reduce the number of parameters by enabling combinations of features of different sizes in the feature fusion network. Our approach confirms that the feature fusion network efficiently combines image compression models while reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scalable coding method by evaluating the image compression performance in terms of decoded image quality and bitrate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in combining LLMs with multimodal learning. Previous surveys of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mainly focus on multimodal understanding. This survey elaborates on multimodal generation and editing across various domains, comprising image, video, 3D, and audio. Specifically, we summarize the notable advancements with milestone works in these fields and categorize these studies into LLM-based and CLIP/T5-based methods. Then, we summarize the various roles of LLMs in multimodal generation and exhaustively investigate the critical technical components behind these methods and the multimodal datasets utilized in these studies. Additionally, we dig into tool-augmented multimodal agents that can leverage existing generative models for human-computer interaction. Lastly, we discuss the advancements in the generative AI safety field, investigate emerging applications, and discuss future prospects. Our work provides a systematic and insightful overview of multimodal generation and processing, which is expected to advance the development of Artificial Intelligence for Generative Content (AIGC) and world models.

      <description>arXiv:2406.01604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CLIP4Clip model transferred from the CLIP has been the de-factor standard to solve the video clip retrieval task from frame-level input, triggering the surge of CLIP4Clip-based models in the video-text retrieval domain. In this work, we rethink the inherent limitation of widely-used mean pooling operation in the frame features aggregation and investigate the adaptions of excitation and aggregation design for discriminative video representation generation. We present a novel excitationand-aggregation design, including (1) The excitation module is available for capturing non-mutuallyexclusive relationships among frame features and achieving frame-wise features recalibration, and (2) The aggregation module is applied to learn exclusiveness used for frame representations aggregation. Similarly, we employ the cascade of sequential module and aggregation design to generate discriminative video representation in the sequential type. Besides, we adopt the excitation design in the tight type to obtain representative frame features for multi-modal interaction. The proposed modules are evaluated on three benchmark datasets of MSR-VTT, ActivityNet and DiDeMo, achieving MSR-VTT (43.9 R@1), ActivityNet (44.1 R@1) and DiDeMo (31.0 R@1). They outperform the CLIP4Clip results by +1.2% (+0.5%), +4.5% (+1.9%) and +9.5% (+2.7%) relative (absolute) improvements, demonstrating the superiority of our proposed excitation and aggregation designs. We hope our work will serve as an alternative for frame representations aggregation and facilitate future research.</description>

Abstract: The escalating frequency and intensity of heat-related climate events, particularly heatwaves, emphasize the pressing need for advanced heat risk management strategies. Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as "thermoglyph" and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts' analytics needs. Our case studies on two cities that faced significant heatwave events and interviews with five experts have demonstrated the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management.</description>
