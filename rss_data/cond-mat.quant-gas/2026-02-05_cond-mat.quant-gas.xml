      <title>Dynamics of string breaking and revival in a Rydberg atomic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04141v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String breaking is one of the most representative non-perturbative dynamics processes in confinement theory, typically associated with the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs. In this paper, we take a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain to theoretically study the dynamical of finite-length string state. Under different string tension conditions, we find that the string dynamics exhibits two clearly distinguishable evolution characteristics: one is that the string breaks and the system enters a superposition state space containing multiple meson state configurations; the other is localized string dynamics, in which the string undergoes local breaking but can then recombine and return to a state close to the initial structure, with the breaking and recombination processes recurring over a long time scale. Through the analysis of the evolution of different meson state configurations, we visually depict the redistribution of configuration weights during the string breaking process, and reveal the observable recovery characteristics of the string after breaking. Further analysis shows that the enhancement of quantum fluctuations can increase the weight of the double-meson state configurations in the system wave function without changing the dominant dynamical behavior. The above results present a rich picture of string breaking dynamics in a one-dimensional Rydberg atomic chain and provide insights for studying confinement physics and related gauge field theory phenomena on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Quantum Droplets in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate deep learning with physical prior knowledge, have proven to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The present work utilizes PINNs to analyze the existence and evolution of quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), revealing the ability of this technique to accurately predict structural features of the QDs, their multipeak profiles, and dynamical behavior. The stable evolution of multipole QDs is thus demonstrated. Comparing different network architectures, including the training time, loss values, and $\mathbb{L_{2}}$ error, PINNs accurately predict specific dynamical characteristics of QDs. Furthermore, the PINN robustness is evaluated by the application of PINN to parameter-discovery tasks, considering both clean training data and data contaminated by $1\%$ random noise. The results highlight the efficiency of PINNs in modeling complex quantum systems and extracting reliable parameters under the noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Density Modulations of Zero Sound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the density modulation of an interacting Fermi gas caused by the uniform motion of an impurity at zero temperature. For strong enough interaction among Fermi atoms, the modulation propagates thanks to the excitation of the collective zero sound mode if the impurity speed is above the zero sound threshold. We are able to assess, via a semi-analytic evaluation, the extent of the zero sound contribution to the density oscillation over and above the incoherent background of particle-hole excitations. Given the strong dependence of the results on the features of the gas interaction potential, we also analyze how they vary depending on its strength, range and shape.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of bound complexes in a two-species Bose-Hubbard lattice: correlations and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium formation of four-particle complexes in a balanced two-species Bose-Hubbard model with repulsive intra- and attractive inter-species interactions. Using exact diagonalization, we characterize the transition from weakly- to strongly-correlated dimer and tetramer states along the one- to two-dimensional crossover in coupled-chain geometries by combining local correlation signatures with global diagnostics such as the binding energy and interspecies entanglement entropy. We show that transverse connectivity between chains qualitatively reshapes the phase diagram, substantially enlarging the tetramer region and, in particular, stabilizing weakly bound tetramers when compared to the one-dimensional chains. By tuning the interchain hopping, we identify a transition from a degenerate manifold of spatially separated dimers to a localized tetramer ground state, driven by the lifting of one-dimensional configurational degeneracies and an associated kinetic-energy gain. Finally, we demonstrate interaction and geometric quench protocols to dynamically prepare these complexes with high fidelity. Our results provide a microscopic framework for engineering and probing few-body bosonic bound states in tunable lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of localization in a finite harmonically confined optical superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of harmonic confinement in a finite optical superlattice and reveal the different mechanisms that can lead to the emergence of localized states. The optical superlattice, with odd or even number of unit cells, can exhibit either a trivial or a non-trivial underlying topology, characterized by the corresponding Zak phase. We focus on a distinct localization mechanism in the intermediate harmonic trapping frequency regime. Specifically, the four lowest-lying eigenstates in this regime form an effective four-level system in the topologically non-trivial configuration. Larger trapping frequency values drive the system into a harmonic trap dominated regime, featuring classical pairing and localization of all states of the lower band, as in a usual optical lattice. For the lower trapping frequency regime, the fate of topological edge states is discussed. Our results are based on exact diagonalization and on a tight-binding approximation that maps the continuous to a discrete system. We address several aspects relevant to the experimental implementation of optical superlattices and provide a brief illustration of the dynamics, highlighting direct ways to observe and distinguish between the different localization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hawking Radiation and Quantum Sensing in a Quenched Chiral Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and detection of Hawking radiation (HR) in a 1D chiral spin chain model, where the gravitational collapse is simulated by a sudden quantum quench that triggers a horizon-inducing phase transition. While our previous work Jaiswal [2025] established that this model mimics BH formation conditions even when the Hoop conjecture is seemingly violated, we here focus on the resulting stationary radiation spectrum and its detectability. By mapping the spin chain dynamics to a Dirac fermion in a curved (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, we analyze the radiation using two complementary approaches: field-theoretic modes and operational quantum sensors. First, using localized Gaussian wave packets to model realistic detectors, we find that the radiation spectrum exhibits deviations from the ideal Planckian form, analogous to frequency-dependent greybody factors, while retaining robust Poissonian statistics that signal the loss of formation-scale information. Second, we introduce a qubit coupled to the chain as a stationary Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the qubit functions as a faithful quantum sensor of the Hawking temperature only in the weak-coupling regime, where its population dynamics are governed solely by the bath spectral density. In the strong-coupling limit, the probe thermalizes with the global environment, obscuring the horizon-induced thermal signature. These results provide a clear operational protocol for distinguishing genuine analog HR from environmental noise in quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Soliton resuscitations: asymmetric revivals of the breathing mode of an atomic bright soliton in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An atomic bright soliton realised in a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate can be considered as an open quantum system. The soliton's breathing mode, for example, is damped by emission of atoms from the soliton to spatial infinity, which thus acts as a Markovian environment for the soliton. If the soliton is held in a shallow harmonic trap, however, the environment becomes non-Markovian: emitted atoms oscillate in the trap and eventually return to the soliton, interfering with it, producing periodic revivals of the breathing mode ("resuscitations"). The amplitude envelopes of these breathing revivals shows a curious asymmetry, with a gradual increase in breathing amplitude followed by sudden drop in amplitude that becomes more and more pronounced in later revivals. We explain this asymmetrical revival pattern in the non-Markovian revivals by deriving a close analytical approximation to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes frequency spectrum for the weakly trapped soliton.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Mobile Ion in a Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of the dynamics of an impurity immersed in a quantum medium is vital for fundamental understanding of matter as well as applications in modern day quantum technologies. The case of strong and long-ranged interactions is of particular importance here, as it opens the possibility to leverage quantum correlations in controlling the system properties. Here, we consider a charged impurity moving in a bosonic gas and study its properties out of equilibrium. We extract the stationary momentum of the ion at long times, which is nonzero due to the superfluid nature of the medium, and the effective mass which stems from dressing the impurity with the host atoms. The nonlinear evolution leads not only to emission of density waves, but also momentum transfer back to the ion, resulting in the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunneling that decays as a power law with distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for continuous tuning of both the dimerization pattern and the disorder strength. Within the parameter space constrained by our geometry, we show that both mechanisms lead to a localized phase that does not resemble standard MBL. This phase can be understood as an ensemble of distinct Hilbert space fragmented realizations induced by small inter-spin separations. As dimerization is commonly associated with Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) physics, we also examine the SPT states across the entire energy spectrum. Despite a partial spin-glass order, we argue that the system hosts an extensive fraction of SPT states.</description>

      <title>Scattering State Theory for One-dimensional Floquet Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Floquet transfer matrix method to solve scattering in extended 1D Floquet lattices, uncovering an underlying conjugate symplectic structure that enforces current conservation across sidebands. By engineering a spatial adiabatic boundary, we suppress multi-channel sideband interference, allowing us to establish a direct mapping between the bulk winding number $C$ and a rigid shift in the transmission energy windows--quantified as $C\hbar\omega$. We further propose two experimental realizations: cold-atom Bragg scattering to directly verify the transmission shift, and surface-acoustic-wave-induced transport demonstrating the quantized zero-bias current plateau.</description>
