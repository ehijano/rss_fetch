      <title>Anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations in classical and quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.</description>

      <title>Is attention all you need to solve the correlated electron problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moir\'e quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate, efficient, and unbiased solution. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic transition in marcasite FeTe2 induced by the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of magnetic ground states in crystalline systems holds significant implications for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite-structured FeTe2, classified as a narrow-gap semiconductor, demonstrates anomalous magnetic behavior in low-temperature experimental investigations. This study employs first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to elucidate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe2. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion critically governs the formation of localized magnetic moments in Fe ions. While bulk FeTe2 is conclusively identified as non-magnetic in its ground state, we demonstrate that the previously observed magnetic responses originate from surface-localized magnetic Fe atoms in FeTe2 specimens. This work establishes a robust yet straightforward criterion for determining ground-state magnetism across diverse localized electron systems, providing critical insights for interpreting magnetic phenomena in correlated electron materials.</description>

      <title>Topological doublon edge states induced by the spatially modulated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties of the one-dimensional interacting systems with spatially modulated interaction in two-particle regime are theoretically investigated. Taking the boson-Hubbard model and spinless fermion interacting model as examples, we show that the energy spectra for doublon (known as two-particle pair) as a function of modulated period exhibit the butterfly-like structure for strongly-correlated limit, whose topological features can be decoded by the topological invariants and topological nontrivial doublon bound edge states. When the nearest-neighbor hopping evolves stronger, the doublon bands could intersect with scattering bands, the one-dimensional interacting systems display the phases of topological insulators and two-particle bound states in the continuum. For a sufficiently larger nearest-neighbor hopping, the doublon collapse takes place, where both the bulk doublon states and topological doublon edge states become unstable and could dissociate into two weakly interacting bosons. For the mapped two-dimensional single-particle systems, numerical calculations manifest the existence of the topological insulator and topological metal phases with corner states located in only one or two corners.</description>

      <title>Universality and Crossovers for Quantum-Criticality in 2d metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple generalization of the theory of crossovers in classical-criticality to quantum-criticality gives that, a Heisenberg model with a small anisotropy favoring planar order has a cross-over towards the fixed point of the xy model in the temperature direction which is very rapid compared to those in the orthogonal directions, if the temporal correlation length is much larger than the spatial correlation length, i.e. for a large dynamic exponent $z$. At the other end of the flow, the stability of the fixed point of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions
  is exponentially enhanced in the temperature direction. This is used to explain why the quantum-critical fluctuations of all measured 2d anti-ferromagnetic compounds - cuprates, heavy-fermion and Fe-based metals shows the characteristic fluctuations of the quantum xy model, and have the same anomalous transport and thermodynamic properties as the cuprates and twisted WSe$_2$ and Graphene. We segue briefly to the range of extended quantum-criticality due to disorder by generalizing the Harris criteria as well, using the properties of the quantum xy model. The observed $T \ln T$ specific heat at criticality is derived quite simply using the same methods which derive the cross-overs.

      <title>Identification of metastable lattice distortion free charge density wave at photoinduced interface via TRARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between different degrees of freedom governs the emergence of correlated electronic states in quantum materials, with charge density waves (CDW) often coexisting with other exotic phases. Under thermal equilibrium, traditional CDW states are consequentially accompanied by structural phase transitions. In contrast, ultrafast photoexcitation allows access to exotic states where a single degree of freedom dominates in the time domain, enabling the study of underlying physics without interference. Here, we report the realization of a long-lived metastable CDW state without lattice distortion at the photoinduced interfaces in GdTe3 using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. After optical excitation above the CDW melting threshold, we identified emerged metastable interfaces through inverting the CDW-coupled lattice distortions, with lifetimes on the order of 10 picoseconds. These photoinduced interfaces represent a novel CDW state lacking the usual amplitude mode and lattice distortions, allowing quantification of the dominant role of electronic instabilities in CDW order. This work provides a new approach to disentangling electronic instabilities from electron-phonon coupling using a nonequilibrium method.</description>

      <title>Flat-Band Driven Kondo Breakdown and Reentrant Effects in Heavy-Fermion Moir\'{e} Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'{e} superlattices (MSLs) in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have demonstrated their incredible power in driving emergent electronic phenomena, some of which are reminiscent of those usually only observed in bulk strongly correlated quantum materials. With the recent discovery of van der Waals $f$-electron materials, the design of novel MSLs of intrinsic strong correlation is now within the reach. Here we study the novel electron phases of two-dimensional heavy-fermion MSL with increasingly diluted f-electron local moments. By applying dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) with numerical renormalization group (NRG) as an impurity solver, we demonstrate the appearance of a new energy scale and a re-entrant Kondo breakdown in connection with the emergence of a flat band in the system. We further compare our numerical findings with predictions derived from the Lieb-Mattis theorem and show the necessity of the new energy scale to consistently reconcile the predictions with the conventional single-impurity limit for exceedingly large unit cells.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature fermion Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin-Peierls systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Abrikosov fermion representation of the spin-1/2 degree of freedom allows for auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin systems. This approach provides a manifold of equivalent actions over which the negative sign problem can be optimised. As a result, we can reach temperature scales well below the magnetic scale. Here, we show how to generalise this algorithm to spin-Peierls systems. In contrast to exact diagonalisation approaches, Monte Carlo methods are not Hilbert space bound such that the computational effort per sweep remains invariant when adding phonons. However, the computational effort required to generate independent configurations increases in the presence of phonons. We also show that, for the specific case of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the inclusion of phonons does not render the negative sign problem more severe. This new algorithm hence allows us to investigate the interplay between phonon degrees of freedom and magnetic frustration. We present results for frustrated and non-frustrated spin systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Qubit Regurlarization of Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the holographic mean-field theory to rank-two symmetric tensor order parameter field coupled with fermion. We classify the roles of symmetric tensor order according to the effect on the spectral density: cone-angle change, squashing, and tilting of the spectral light cones. In case of the over-tilted light cone, an analytic continuation of the Green's function is necessary to preserve the continuity of the spectrum inside the lightcone. Our results provide agreements between the holographic spectra with those observed in real materials, such as type-II Dirac cones and strained graphene.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the normal and superconducting state properties of ternary scandium tellurides, Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M = $ Fe, Ru and Ir) through chemical substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of a unifying theory for non-BCS superconductivity has faced significant challenges. One approach to overcome such challenges is to perform systematic investigations into superconductors containing \textit{d}-electron metals in order to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Recently, the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = d-electron metal) family has emerged as a unique series of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across a range of $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ electron systems. In this study, we employ muon spin rotation, neutron diffraction, and magnetisation techniques to probe the normal and superconducting states at a microscopic level. Our findings reveal extremely dilute superfluid densities that correlate with the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). Additionally, we identify high-temperature normal-state transitions that are inversely correlated with $T_\mathrm{c}$. Notably, in Sc$_6$FeTe$_2$, the superconducting pairing symmetry is most likely characterised by two nodeless gaps, one of which closes as electron correlations diminish in the Ru and Ir Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds. These results classify the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds ($M$ = Fe, Ru, Ir) as unconventional bulk superconductors, where the normal-state transitions and superconducting properties are governed by the interplay between electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling of the d-electron metal.</description>

      <title>Even denominator fractional quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level of monolayer-like band of ABA trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is a macroscopic manifestation of strong electron-electron interactions. Even denominator FQH states (FQHSs) at half-filling are particularly interesting as they are predicted to host non-Abelian excitations with non-trivial braiding statistics. Such states are predominantly observed in the $N=1$ Landau level (LL) of semiconductors such as GaAs. In this Letter, we report the unanticipated observation of even-denominator FQHSs in the $N=0$ LL of ABA trilayer graphene (TLG), a system characterized by tunable LL mixing and the absence of inversion symmetry. Notably, we find robust FQHSs at $\nu=5/2$ and $\nu=7/2$ when two LLs, originating from a monolayer-like band of TLG with different isospin indices, cross each other. These are flanked by the Levin-Halperin daughter states at $\nu=7/13$ and $\nu=9/17$, respectively, and further away, the standard series of Jain-sequence of composite fermions (CFs) is observed. The even-denominator FQHSs and their accompanying daughter states become stronger with increasing magnetic fields, while concomitantly, a weakening of the CF states is observed. We posit that the absence of inversion symmetry in the system gives rise to additional isospin interactions, which enhance LL mixing and soften the short-range part of the Coulomb repulsion, stabilizing the even-denominator FQHSs. In addition, we demonstrate that these states, along with their daughter states, can be finely tuned with an external displacement field that serves as an important tool to control the LL mixing in the system.</description>

We reformulate the first-principles Ehrenfest equation (fpEE) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 031026 (2023)] in terms of Born-Oppenheimer phonon frequencies and identify key simplifications that lead to current models. Our main findings are that the conventional equation of motion for coherent phonons needs revision, as it does not arise from the fpEE, and that the $e$-$ph$ coupling should be replaced by an unconventional dynamically screened coupling. The fpEE is also used to develop a first-principles polaron theory of lattice distortions.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity superconductivity underpinned by antiferromagnetism in heavy fermion metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological superconductors are essential elements of the periodic table of topological quantum matter. However, the relevant odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors are rare. We report high-resolution measurements of the complex electrical impedance of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ down to 0.4 mK, that reveal the presence of several superconducting states, suppressed differently by magnetic field, both Pauli-limited and beyond the Pauli limit. Superconductivity is abruptly switched off at the critical field of the primary antiferromagnetic order. The onset of electro-nuclear spin density wave order enhances the superconductivity, which we account for by the simultaneous formation of a spin-triplet pair density wave. Together these observations provide compelling evidence for odd-parity superconductivity, and its underpinning by antiferromagnetism, and allow us to identify the topological helical state.</description>

      <title>Observation of Magnon-Polarons in the Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental prerequisite of these exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity, nematic order, and checkerboard charge order. Here we explore the filling-dependent multiple stable intertwined electronic and atomic orders of flat-band state of 1T-TaS2 encompassing hole order, phase orders, coexisting left- and right-chiral orders and mixed phase/chiral orders via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Combining first-principles calculations, the emergent electronic/atomic orders can be attributed to the weakening of electron-electron correlations and stacking-dependent interlayer interactions. Moreover, achiral intermediate ring-like clusters and nematic charge density wave (CDW) states are successfully realized in intralayer chiral domain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions through chiral overlap configurations. Our study not only deepens the understanding of filling-dependent electronic/atomic orders in flat-band systems, but also offers perspectives for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Randomness and Gapped Itinerant Carriers in a Frustrated Quantum Magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a state manifesting extraordinary many-body entanglement, and the material NaYbSe$_2$ is thought to be one of the most promising candidates for its realization. Through low-temperature heat capacity and thermal conductivity measurements we identify an apparent contradiction familiar to many QSL candidates: while entropy is stored by apparently gapless excitations, the itinerant carriers of entropy are gapped. By studying the compositional series NaYb$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ across a percolation transition of the magnetic lattice, we suggest that this contradiction can be resolved by the presence of entanglement scales of random sizes. Moreover, as we truncate the scale of entanglement by magnetic dilution, we show that the itinerant magnetic entropy carrier in NaYb$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ is not the result of long-range entanglement but rather depends on the propagation of the simplest entangled object of all: the spin dimer.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the local density of states of strongly correlated fermions coupled to a nanoprobe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two quantum theories which look different but are secretly describing the same low-energy physics are said to be dual to each other. When realized in the Topological Holography formalism, duality corresponds to changing the gapped boundary condition on the top boundary of a topological field theory, which determines the symmetry of the system, while not affecting the bottom boundary where all the dynamics take place. In this paper, we show that duality in the Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that accurately describes resonances beyond the reach of both multiplet-based and density-functional-theory (DFT)-based codes. When a resonance acquires strong continuum character, multiplet approaches struggle with the exponential growth of the Hilbert space driven by the increasing number of relevant orbitals, if they extend beyond a few atomic and ligand orbitals. Conversely, existing \emph{ab initio} codes, supplemented by diagrammatic techniques, remain largely confined to the Bethe--Salpeter equation, which tracks only two-particle excitations. However, many systems of interest, particularly those containing open $d$ or $f$ shells, require the propagation of an $N$-particle system, yielding a richer spectral landscape dominated by significant continuum effects. Here, we propose a theoretical framework, together with its numerical implementation, that bridges this gap and enables the rigorous exploration of such resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the strength of low-temperature T-linear normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently observed an intimate link between the nature of the strange metallic normal-state and superconductivity in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is calling for an explanation. Here the intrinsic correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. On the one hand, the main ingredient is identified into a electron pairing mechanism involving the spin excitation, and then $T_{\rm c}$ has a dome-like shape doping dependence with the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ that occurs at around the optimal electron doping. On the other hand, in the normal-state above $T_{\rm c}$, the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity in the overdoped regime arises from the momentum relaxation due to the electron umklapp scattering mediated by the same spin excitation. This same spin excitation that governs both the electron umklapp scattering responsible for the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and electron pairing responsible for superconductivity naturally generates a correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>

Abstract: We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the operator growth hypothesis with questions of localization. We analytically show that an almost factorial growth of the operator norm - as recently proven for the random Ising model - is inconsistent with an exponential localization of $A$. Assuming that a quasi-local unitary $U$ exists which maps $H$ onto an effective Hamiltonian $\tilde H=UHU^\dagger=\sum_n E_n \tau^z_n +\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \tau^z_i\tau^z_j+\dots$, we show that $\tilde A=UAU^\dagger$ is a quasi-local operator which in the many-body case does not remain exponentially localized in general leading to an almost factorial norm growth. Therefore the unitary $U$ in many-body systems with maximal norm growth either does not exist and such systems are always ergodic or unusual non-ergodic phases described by $\tilde H$ do exist which violate the operator growth hypothesis and in which operators spread, implying that transport will eventually set in. We analytically and symbolically verify our results for the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models. For the XXX case, the symbolic calculations are consistent with a maximal norm growth. Furthermore, we find no indication of a weakened exponential localization of $A$, expected for strong disorder and low commutator orders if the unitary $U$ does exist. Finally, we try to perturbatively construct $U$ by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. While it is straightforward to show that this construction converges in the Anderson case, we find no indications for a convergence in the interacting case, suggesting that $U$ does not exist and that many-body localization is absent.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic constraint on $T_c$ for unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can room temperature superconductivity be achieved in correlated materials under ambient pressure? Our answer to this billion-dollar question is probably no, at least for realistic models within the current theoretical framework. This is shown by our systematic simulations on the pairing instability of some effective models for two-dimensional superconductivity. For a square lattice model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of weakly-connected $2\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction. The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum critical point. Thus, the magnitude of $T_c$ is constrained by the plaquette state for the $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders. We then extend our simulations to a variety of effective models covering nearest-neighbour or onsite pairings, single layer or two-layer structures, intralayer or interlayer pairings, and find an intrinsic maximum of the ratio $T_c/J\approx 0.04-0.07$, where $J$ is the pairing interaction. Comparison with existing experiments supports this constraint in cuprate, iron-based, nickelate, and heavy fermion superconductors, despite that these compounds are so complicated well beyond our simplified models. As a result, the known families of unconventional superconductivity, possibly except the infinite-layer nickelates, seem to almost exhaust their potentials in reaching the maximal $T_c$ allowed by their respective $J$, while achieving room temperature superconductor would require a much larger $J$ beyond 400-700 meV, which seems unrealistic in existing correlated materials and hence demands novel pairing mechanisms. The agreement also implies some deep underlying principles of the constraint that urge for a more rigorous theoretical understanding.</description>

Abstract: Discrete time crystalline phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of nonadiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which, surprisingly, is possible in nonergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required nonergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in nondisordered, nonintegrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Cooling Algorithm for Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge. With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size, as long as the initial state is prepared in a low-energy sector of polynomial size. We achieve the latter via a pseudo-adiabatic sweep from a parameter regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We estimate that our algorithm has a polynomial runtime for systems where the spectral gap decreases at most polynomially in system size, and is faster than the adiabatic algorithm for a large range of settings. We generalize the algorithm to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinant quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Noise-resilient and resource-efficient hybrid algorithm for robust quantum gap estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum algorithm for estimating gaps in many-body energy spectra, supported by an analytic proof of its inherent resilience to state preparation and measurement errors, as well as mid-circuit multi-qubit depolarizing noise. Our analysis extends to a broader class of Markovian noise, employing error mitigation strategies that optimize the utilization of quantum resources. By integrating trial-state optimization and classical signal processing into the algorithm, we amplify the signal peak corresponding to the exact target gap beyond the error threshold, thereby significantly reducing gap estimate errors. The algorithm's robustness is demonstrated through noisy simulations on the Qiskit Aer simulator and demonstrations on IBM Quantum processors. These results underscore the potential to enable accurate quantum simulations on near-term noisy quantum devices without resource-intensive error correction.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.</description>

      <title>The large $N$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.</description>

Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians</title>

Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>
