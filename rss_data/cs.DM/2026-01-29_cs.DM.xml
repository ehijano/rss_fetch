      <title>The Interplay Between Domination and Separation in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature, several identification problems in graphs have been studied, of which, the most widely studied are the ones based on dominating sets as a tool of identification. Hereby, the objective is to separate any two vertices of a graph by their unique neighborhoods in a suitably chosen dominating or total-dominating set. Such a (total-)dominating set endowed with a separation property is often referred to as a code of the graph. In this paper, we study the four separation properties location, closed-separation, open-separation and full-separation. We address the complexity of finding minimum separating sets in a graph and study the interplay of these separation properties with several codes (establishing a particularly close relation between separation and codes based on domination) as well as the interplay of separation and complementation (showing that location and full-separation are the same on a graph and its complement, whereas closed-separation in a graph corresponds to open-separation in its complement).</description>

      <title>A Quantum Photonic Approach to Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a quantum computational model that leverages linear optics to solve sampling problems believed to be classically intractable. Recent experimental breakthroughs have demonstrated quantum advantage using GBS, motivating its application to real-world combinatorial optimization problems.
  In this work, we reformulate the graph coloring problem as an integer programming problem using the independent set formulation. This enables the use of GBS to identify cliques in the complement graph, which correspond to independent sets in the original graph. Our method is benchmarked against classical heuristics and exact algorithms on two sets of instances: Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs and graphs derived from a smart-charging use case. The results demonstrate that GBS can provide competitive solutions, highlighting its potential as a quantum-enhanced heuristic for graph-based optimization.</description>

      <title>On Patterns and Languages in 1-11-Representations of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 1-11-representation of a graph $G(V,E)$ is a word over the alphabet $V$ such that two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if the restricted word $w{x,y}$ (obtained from $w$ by deleting all letters except $x$ and $y$) contains at most one occurrence of $xx$ or $yy$. Although every graph admits a 1-11-representation, the repetition patterns that may or must appear in such representations have not been fully studied.
  In this paper, we study cube-free and square-free 1-11-representations of graphs. We first show that cubes cannot always be avoided in 1-11-representations of minimum length by providing a graph for which every minimum-length 1-11-representation necessarily contains a cube. We then focus on permutational 1-11-representations, where the representing word is a concatenation of permutations of the vertex set. In this setting, we prove that any cube appearing in a permutational 1-11-representation can be removed without changing the represented graph. As a consequence, every permutational 1-11-representation attaining the permutational 1-11-representation number is cube-free. We further show that this behaviour does not extend to squares by providing a graph for which every permutational 1-11-representation with the minimum number of permutations necessarily contains a square.
  Finally, we prove that the language of all 1-11-representations of a given graph is regular. Moreover, we show that the language of all permutational 1-11-representations of a graph is also regular.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds on the zeros of the chromatic polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any graph $G$ the (complex) zeros of its chromatic polynomial, $\chi_G(x)$, lie inside the disk centered at $0$ of radius $4.25 \Delta(G)$, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. This improves on a recent result of Jenssen, Patel and Regts, who proved a bound of $5.94\Delta(G)$. Moreover, we show that for graphs of sufficiently large girth we can replace $4.25$ by $3.60$ and for claw-free graphs we can replace $4.25$ by $3.81$.
  Our proofs add some substantially novel ideas to those developed by Jenssen, Patel, and Regts, while building on them. A key novel ingredient for claw-free graphs is to use a representation of the coefficients of the chromatic polynomial in terms of the number of certain partial acyclic orientations.</description>
