      <title>Numerical asymptotics of near-axis expansions of quasisymmetric magnetohydrostatic equilibria with anisotropic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) is a property of special magnetic configurations, where the magnetic field strength, but not necessarily the full vector field, has a direction of symmetry. QS leads to reduced neoclassical transport and thus can be a desirable property in stellarator design. The Garren-Boozer (GB) conundrum has been interpreted to mean that globally quasisymmetric magnetohydrostatic (MHS) equilibria, other than axisymmetric solutions, with isotropic pressure do not exist. When expanded as power series of an effective minor radius, the governing equations become overdetermined at the 3rd order. Despite this, recent optimization efforts have found numerical isotropic-pressure equilibria with nearly exact global QS. To reconcile these two perspectives, Rodriguez and Bhattacharjee (RB) showed that by introducing pressure anisotropy into the problem, one can overcome the GB conundrum. This formally enables the study of equilibria with exact, global QS. Building on RB's work, we present pyAQSC, the first code for solving the near-axis expansion (NAE) of anisotropic-pressure quasisymmetric equilibria to any order. As a demonstration, we present a 6th order, QA near-axis equilibrium with anisotropic pressure, and a convergence analysis. PyAQSC opens the door to the study of higher-order properties of equilibria with exact global QS. Like existing isotropic-pressure NAE codes, PyAQSC can accelerate stellarator optimization as an initial state tool. However, by optimizing for low pressure anisotropy in a space that allows anisotropy, pyAQSC may discover practical QS stellarator designs previously hard to access. We give results comparing the RB method with DESC equilibria with anisotropic pressure.</description>

      <title>Simulations of the churning mode: toroidally symmetric plasma convection and turbulence around the X-points in a snowflake divertor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a reduced MHD model, extended to include field-aligned thermal conduction, we present numerical simulations of the churning mode (CM): a toroidally symmetric, non-linear plasma vortex in the vicinity of the null points in a snowflake (SF) divertor (Ryutov et al., Phys. Scr. 89 088002, 2014). Simulations are carried out across a range of inter-null separations, $d_{xx}$, and inter-null orientations, $\theta$, primarily in conditions relevant to the MAST-U tokamak. We find that, when $d_{xx}$ is small, the CM induces additional transport across the X-points when $\beta_{pm} \gtrsim 8$ %, where $\beta_{pm}$ is the ratio of the plasma pressure in the null region to poloidal magnetic pressure at the midplane. This transport also increases approximately linearly as $d_{xx}$ is reduced. A diffusive model of this transport is shown to predict the total transport across the null points, where diffusion coefficients of up to $\sim 10^2$ m$^2$s$^{-1}$ centred on a small region around the X-points are used. However, the CM also results in significant changes to the flux surfaces in the null region which is not captured by this diffusive model. The changes in magnetic geometry mean the fractional exhaust power delivered to each divertor leg is highly sensitive to $\beta_{pm}$, $d_{xx}$ and $\theta$. For small values of $\theta$, the CM can induce a change in topology, redirecting exhaust power from a secondary divertor leg on the high field side to one on the low field side. Similar behaviour is found in the fraction of exhaust power going to the inner and outer divertor. Such changes in the flux surfaces may not be captured by Grad-Shafranov solvers and so may be a source of error in the magnetic reconstruction of SF experiments. We consistently find that the fractional exhaust power going to a secondary divertor leg on the high field side is small, consistent with SF experiments.</description>

      <title>Reactive molecular dynamics approach to PFAS plasma oxidation in water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a protocol to study via Molecular Dynamics simulation the degradation of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in water by hydroxyl radical. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, using ReaxFF reactive interaction potential. Simulations are carried out under a temperature ramp for determining all possible products. Using this methodology, reaction pathways of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are identified.</description>

      <title>Complex pseudo-partition functions in the Configurationally-Resolved Super-Transition-Array approach for radiative opacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A few years ago, Kurzweil and Hazak developed the Configurationally Resolved Super-Transition-Arrays (CRSTA) method for the computation of hot-plasma radiative opacity. Their approach, based on a temporal integration, is an important refinement of the standard Super-Transition-Arrays (STA) approach, which enables one to recover the underlying structure of the STAs, made of unresolved transition arrays. The CRSTA formalism relies on the use of complex pseudo partition functions, depending on the considered one-electron jump. In this article, we find that, despite the imaginary part, the doubly-recursive relation which was introduced in the original STA method to avoid problems due to alternating-sign terms in partition functions, is still applicable, robust, efficient, and exempt of numerical instabilities. This was rather unexpected, in particular because of the occurrence of trigonometric functions, or Chebyshev polynomials, which can be either positive or negative. We also show that, in the complex case, the recursion relation can be presented in a form where the vector of real and imaginary parts at a given iteration is therefore obtained by a sum of the rotated previous ones.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results from the CLEAR nonlinear plasma lens experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma lensing provides compact focusing of electron beams, since they offer strong focusing fields (kT/m) in both planes simultaneously. This becomes particularly important for highly diverging beams with a large energy spread such as those typically originating from plasma accelerators. The lens presented here is a nonlinear active plasma lens, with a controlled focusing-strength variation purposely introduced in one transverse direction. This lens is a key element of a larger transport lattice, core of the ERC project SPARTA, which aims to provide a solution for achromatic transport between plasma-accelerator stages. We report on preliminary experimental results from the CLEAR facility at CERN, which aims to probe the magnetic field structure of the lens using an electron beam, in search of the desired nonlinearity, together with 2D plasma simulation results.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinearities in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma: can other processes mimic debris-induced effects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an analysis of nonlinear waves and structures induced by an external charged debris in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma is presented. The results obtained are compared with findings from available experiments involving PINI plasma. The process of formation of different nonlinear structures is examined theoretically through a forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) equation, which is also verified with a multi-fluid flux-corrected transport simulation code mFCT. Various processes which are responsible for different nonlinear waves and structures excited by differently charged external debris are pointed out. This work also points out the similarities in different nonlinear structures {excited} by an external charged debris and the underlying processes (this work) and those {observed experimentally through processes that do not involve any external debris.</description>

      <title>The shear Alfv\'en continuum of quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) continuum plays a critical role in the stability of energetic particle-driven Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the SAW continuum in three-dimensional quasisymmetric magnetic fields, focusing on its implications for stellarator design. By employing a near-axis model and degenerate perturbation theory, the continuum equation is solved, highlighting unique features in 3D configurations, such as the interactions between spectral gaps. Numerical examples validate the theory, demonstrating the impact of flux surface shaping and quasisymmetric field properties on continuum structure. The results provide insights into optimizing stellarator configurations to minimize resonance-driven losses of energetic particles. This work establishes a basis for incorporating Alfv\'enic stability considerations into the stellarator design process, demonstrated through optimization of a quasihelical configuration to avoid high-frequency spectral gaps.</description>
