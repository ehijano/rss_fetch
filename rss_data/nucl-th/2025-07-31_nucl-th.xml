      <title>The influence of electromagnetic fields on the generation of the directed and elliptic flows of heavy quark in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of self-generated electromagnetic fields (EMF) on the charm quarks momentum evolution in the partonic and hadronic medium created in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energy within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) off-shell transport approach. In the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase, the charm quark interacts with the off-shell partons whose mass and widths are given by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM), which can reproduce the lattice QCD thermodynamics. The background electromagnetic fields are computed dynamically within the PHSD considering both the spectators and participants protons as well as newly produced charged hadrons, quarks, and antiquarks, which reflects naturally the electric conductivity $\sigma_{el}$ of the medium. We study the directed and elliptic flow of the $D$ mesons in the presence of the electromagnetic fields. We find that electromagnetically induced splitting in the $D$ meson $v_1$ through $D^0$ and $\overline{D}^0$ mesons is consistent with the experimental data. Furthermore, we notice that the splitting in the heavy quark $v_1$ as a function of $p_T$ is more prominent as a probe of the produced electromagnetic fields. However, we find only a small impact of electromagnetic fields on the heavy quark elliptic flow $v_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These proceedings review the application of Bayesian inference to high momentum transfer probes of the quark--gluon plasma (QGP). Bayesian inference techniques are introduced, highlighting critical components to consider when comparing analyses. Recent calibrations using hadron observables are described, illustrating the importance of the choice of parametrization. Additional recent analyses that characterize the impact of the inclusion of jet observables, as well as soft-hard correlations, are reviewed. Finally, lessons learned from these analyses and important questions for the future are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Compositeness of near-threshold states with repulsive Coulomb interaction combined with short-range potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal structure of near-threshold states in a system with a repulsive Coulomb interaction combined with a short-range potential, using the compositeness. We construct a model in which the eigenmomentum is expressed in terms of three observables: the Coulomb scattering length, the Coulomb effective range, and the Bohr radius. In the presence of the Coulomb interaction, a bound state directly goes into a resonance as parameters are varied, bypassing a virtual state, in contrast to the case with only the short-range interaction. We show that the compositeness of near-threshold states can be expressed solely in terms of these observables. When the magnitude of the Coulomb effective range is much smaller than that of the Bohr radius, both shallow bound states and near-threshold resonances exhibit common structures with large compositeness, reflecting the remnant of the low-energy universality.</description>

      <title>Role of meson exchange and final-state interaction in $J/\psi$-meson photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $J/\psi$ photoproduction off the nucleon using a dynamical model based on a Hamiltonian framework. First, Pomeron exchange is regarded as a background contribution that accounts for the gradual rise of the total cross section with increasing beam energy. Then, the meson-exchange and direct $J/\psi$-radiation contributions are included as part of the Born term. More specifically, we examine the contributions of the light-meson [$\pi^0(135)$, $\eta(548)$, $\eta'(958)$, $f_1(1285)$] and charmonium-meson [$\eta_c(1S)$, $\chi_{c0}(1P)$, $\chi_{c1}(1P)$, $\eta_c(2S)$, $\chi_{c1}(3872)$] exchanges in the $t$-channel diagram. Most of the coupling constants are determined from the radiative decays of the $J/\psi$ or other relevant charmonium states. Finally, we consider the $J/\psi N$ final-state interaction (FSI) within the leading-order approximation, which includes gluon-exchange and direct $J/\psi N$-coupling terms. The model parameters of the Hamiltonian are fitted to the data from the GlueX and $J/\psi$-007 experiments at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). The light mesons $\eta(548)$ and $\eta'(958)$ are found to make the most significant contributions, whereas the charmonium mesons play only a minor role. The direct $J/\psi$-radiation term begins to come into play only in the backward scattering regions. The FSI contribution is suppressed by a factor of $10^1 - 10^2$ in comparison to the Born-term contribution when a Yukawa-type potential is employed for the charmonium-nucleon interaction. Our results agree well with the available JLab data on the total and $t$-dependent differential cross sections. High-precision, angle-dependent data in the threshold region ($E_\gamma \leqslant 8.9$ GeV) are crucial for confirming the FSI effect.</description>

      <title>Kaon-deuteron femtoscopy from unitarized chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have performed a theoretical study of the correlation functions of $K^- d$ and $K^+ d$ pairs and compared them with those provided by the ALICE Collaboration from Pb-Pb collisions, and also from high-multiplicity p-p collisions in the case of $K^+ d$. In addition to implementing the effect of the Coulomb force, the $K^- d$ and $K^+ d$ wave functions are derived from the corresponding strong scattering amplitudes that are built employing a unitarized chiral model for the elementary $K^- N$ and $K^+ N$ interactions. We present results for the impulse approximation, which accounts for single-scattering processes of the kaon with the nucleons of the deuteron, as well as for the solution of the Faddeev equations in the so-called fixed center approximation, which includes multiple rescattering effects. The $K^- d$ correlation function is shown to be very sensitive to both the size of the source and the relative momentum of the interacting pair, with large deviations from the Coulomb baseline and sizable multi-step scattering contributions, effects that are tied to a ${\bar K}N$ strong interaction that is dominated by the influence of the subthreshold resonance $\Lambda(1405)$. In contrast, the $K^+ d$ correlation function only differs appreciably from the Coulomb one for relatively small sources, reflecting the mildly repulsive and elastic behavior of the $KN$ strong force. The calculated correlation functions are found to nicely reproduce the experimental data of the ALICE collaboration. Our study serves to reinforce the validity of the theoretical models employed and demonstrates the value of femtoscopy as a powerful tool for probing hadronic interactions involving strangeness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study both orbital and spin contributions to quarkonia spin alignment induced by magnetic field in heavy ion collisions. The orbital contribution arises from distortion of quarkonium spatial wave function, and the spin contribution is due to spin states mixing in the magnetic field. We find the spin contribution dominates in heavy ion phenomenology. The subleading orbital contribution offers the possibility of studying structure change of quarkonium in magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and emergent symmetries in hadron scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one potential origin of emergent symmetries. In this work, we extend this theoretical framework to accommodate particles with arbitrary spins and/or arbitrary group representations. As case studies, we discuss recent efforts to test the entanglement-suppression conjecture in two hadron systems that exhibit possible emergent symmetries. The first concerns interactions involving spin-3/2 baryons, where entanglement suppression gives rise to symmetries such as $\text{SU}(40)$ spin-flavor symmetry. The second system involves low-energy scattering of heavy mesons, where entanglement suppression leads to an enhancement of the inherent heavy-quark spin symmetry to a light-quark spin symmetry, predicting additional siblings for the prominent exotic double-charm meson $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. These predictions should be confronted against experimental data and lattice results to further test the minimal-entanglement conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Nuclear Dynamics in First Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of real time dynamics of nuclear systems is of great importance to provide theoretical predictions of cross sections relevant for both terrestrial experiments as well as applications in astrophysics. First principles simulations of these dynamical processes is however hindered by an exponential cost in classical resources and the possibility of performing scalable simulations using quantum computers is currently an active field of research. In this work we provide the first complete characterization of the resource requirements for studying nuclear dynamics with the full Leading Order (LO) pionless EFT Hamiltonian in first quantization employing simulation strategies using both product formulas as well as Quantum Signal Processing. In particular, we show that time evolution of such an Hamiltonian can be performed with polynomial resources in the number of particles, and logarithmic resources in the number of single-particle basis states. This result provides an exponential improvement compared with previous work on the same Hamiltonian model in second quantization. We find that interesting simulations for low energy nuclear scattering could be achievable with tens of millions of T gates and few hundred logical qubits suggesting that the study of simple nuclear reactions could be amenable for early fault tolerant quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>The $1/N_c$ Operator Analysis of the Combined Octet and Decuplet Baryons Contact Interactions in SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the non-derivative four-point interactions for Octet and Decuplet baryons in the SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChEFT) framework and there are {black}{104} terms. The non-relativistic expansion of the baryon fields has been considered up to the {Next-to-Leading Order} (NLO) of the three-momentum. We find 28 and 106 Low-Energy Constants (LECs) for {Leading Order} (LO) and NLO, respectively. Using the Hartree Hamiltonian of the $1/N_c$ expansion of the operator product up to {Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order} (NNLO), we can reduce the free parameters (coupling constants) of the ChEFT from 104 down to 53 up to NLO of the three-momentum expansion. Moreover, we will discuss the implications of the large-$N_c$ sum rules in $\Omega\Omega$ and $\Omega N$ scatterings where the future results from lattice QCD can be used to test our sum rules.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a macroscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena have been predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, more recently, quantum particle teleportation.
  Here, we introduce the third teleportation-like phenomenon - apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of the Standard Model's indistinguishable elementary particles and antiparticles. We illustrate the idea within a 1+1D toy model of particle-antiparticle creation and space-time evolution obeying transport locality. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to observe apparent teleportation driven by strong interactions through measurements of correlations between the momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in nuclear collisions. Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles.</description>

Abstract: We perform a global analysis of deep-inelastic $e+p$ scattering data from HERA and transverse energy distributions in $p+p$ and $p+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions, alongside charged hadron multiplicities in $\mathrm{Pb}+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02\;\mathrm{TeV}$ from ALICE. Using a saturation-based initial state model grounded in high-energy QCD, we determine the early-time non-equilibrium shear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\eta/s$ of the quark-gluon plasma. Our results provide new insights into the early-time transport properties of nuclear matter under extreme conditions.</description>

Abstract: Our present knowledge of the nuclear equation of state is briefly reviewed in this article intended for a wider readership. Particular emphasis is given to the asymmetric-matter equation of state required for modeling neutron stars, neutron-star mergers, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Recent analyses based on combining information obtained from nuclear theory, heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations confine the obtained radii of the canonical 1.4-solar-mass neutron star to values between 12 km and 13 km. The remaining uncertainty is primarily related to missing information in the density interval between nuclear saturation density and about twice that value which, however, is accessible with laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We suggest a new look onto the thermodynamics of cold isospin QCD matter described within the quarkyonic framework, when confining forces are essential only for the momentum states close to the Fermi sphere and lead to formation of the quark-antiquark correlations with quantum numbers of pions. Within this picture cold isospin QCD matter is constituted by the Bose-Einstein condensate of pions and free (anti)quarks. We develop a simple confining model of pions existing as the lowest energy $P$-state of in-medium three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and use it to show that under the conditions of isospin QCD quarkyonic matter can onset at densities significantly smaller than the overlap density of pions. Using the experimentally established pion charge radius we demonstrate that the onset density can be even lower than two nuclear saturation densities. To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory inspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion among pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of the key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea approximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The latter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion density and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic freedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the results of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and with the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Single-flavor heavy baryons in a strong magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of single-flavor heavy baryons, $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ and $\Omega_{\rm bbb}$, in a strong magnetic field. For that sake, we simply treat the baryons as quark-diquark two-body systems, and a systematic formalism is developed to deal with two-body Schr$\ddot{\text o}$dinger equations in a magnetic field. It is found that: 1. The orbital properties of $\Omega_{\rm bbb}$ are almost not affected by the magnetic field. 2. $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ is more tightly bound in the presence of a magnetic field. 3. The magnetic-spin effect dominates over the magnetic-orbital effect. Applying to peripheral heavy ion collisions, $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ is much better than $\Omega_{\rm bbb}$ to explore the magnetic effect, and the discovery of $\Omega_{\rm ccc}$ could be more promising.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of the static neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars, based on the equations of state derived from a pion mean-field approach. Using the empirical data on the pion-nucleus scattering and bulk properties of nuclear matter, we have already fixed all the parameters in a previous work, where the nucleons and hyperons were shown to be modified in various nuclear medium. In the current work, we first examine the energy and pressure inside a neutron star. We show that the central densities in various neutron stars vary within the range of $(3-4)\rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density. The mass-radius relations are obtained and discussed. As the slope parameter for neutron matter increases, the radii of the neutron stars increase with their masses fixed. We also study the strangeness-mixed stars or the hyperon stars using the same sets of the parameters. As the strangeness content of strange matter increases, the binding energy per nucleon is saturated and the corresponding equation of state becomes softened. Consequently, the central densities of the strangeness-mixed stars increase. Assuming that recently observed neutron stars are the strangeness-mixed ones, we find that the central densities increase.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Porter-Thomas Distribution due to Nonstatistical $\gamma$ Decay below the $^{150}$Nd Neutron Separation Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19185v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for the study of fluctuations of partial transition widths based on nuclear resonance fluorescence experiments with quasimonochromatic linearly polarized photon beams below particle separation thresholds. It is based on the average branching of decays of $J=1$ states of an even-even nucleus to the $2^+_1$ state in comparison to the ground state. Between 5 and 7 MeV, a constant average branching ratio for $\gamma$ decays from $1^-$ states of 0.490(16) is observed for the nuclide $^{150}$Nd. Assuming $\chi^2$-distributed partial transition widths, this average branching ratio is related to a degree of freedom of $\nu = 1.93(12)$, rejecting the validity of the Porter-Thomas distribution, requiring $\nu=1$. The observed deviation can be explained by nonstatistical effects in the $\gamma$-decay behavior with contributions in the range of 9.4(10)% up to 94(10)%.</description>

      <title>Dominance of gluonic scale anomaly in confining pressure inside nucleon and D-term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the confining pressure inside the nucleon and the related gravitational form factor referred to as the D-term, using the skyrmion approach based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory, where the skyrmion is described as the nucleon and a scalar meson couples to the scale anomaly through the low energy theorem. Within this model framework, the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly can be described by the pion and scalar meson masses, respectively, through matching with the underlying QCD. By considering the decomposition of the energy momentum tensor of nucleon, we examine the role of the scale anomaly contributions in the pressure inside the nucleon. As a result, the gluonic scale anomaly is found to dominate the confining pressure. Compared to the result based on the conventional chiral perturbation theory in the chiral limit, our result for the total pressure is capable of qualitatively improving the alignment with lattice QCD observations. Moreover, the pressure from the gluonic scale anomaly is widely distributed in position space, leading to its substantial contribution to the D-term.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Molecules and $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ Coupled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm exotic mesons based on a coupled-channel framework, where the physical states are described as superpositions of a compact $c\bar c$ core (identified with the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ states) and hadronic components such as $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$. We incorporate meson exchange potentials to describe hadron-hadron interactions and determine model parameters to reproduce the observed masses of $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$. The model also predicts a $0^{++}$ bound state consistent with the $X(3860)$. The internal structure is found to be predominantly molecular for the $X(3872)$, while the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$ have larger $c\bar{c}$ components. The coupling between $c\bar{c}$ cores and hadronic components plays a crucial role in generating these states. The resulting wave functions provide insight into the internal structure and decay properties of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Shape evolution in neutron-rich odd-even $^{105-109}$Nb isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron-rich nuclei around $Z\sim40$ exhibit multiple shape transitions. This region shows one of the sharpest transitions in the nuclear chart, from a spherical vibrator at $N=58$ to a strongly deformed prolate shape at $N=60$, with largest deformations seen for $_{38}$Sr and $_{40}$Zr. Below $Z=36$, a spherical-to-oblate transition is predicted, while above $Z=42$ and $N\ge60$, the shape evolves from axial to triaxial. Even-$Z$ nuclei have been well studied, but odd-$Z$ isotopes such as Nb offer additional insights into these mechanisms. The Nb isotopes lie at the boundary between axially deformed Zr and triaxially deformed Mo nuclei. This work explores the structure of neutron-rich Nb nuclei up to $N=68$, aiming to understand shape evolution with isospin and the onset of triaxiality. Two complementary fission experiments were used: (i) $^{238}$U+$^9$Be at GANIL in inverse kinematics with AGATA, EXOGAM, and VAMOS++, allowing prompt and delayed $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with isotopic identification; (ii) spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf with the Gammasphere array providing high-fold $\gamma$-coincidence data. The level scheme of $^{105}$Nb was significantly extended with two new negative-parity bands. A revised scheme is proposed for $^{107}$Nb, differing from previous results, and new structures are reported in $^{109}$Nb. The signature splitting analysis indicates triaxial deformation for positive-parity bands, while negative-parity bands show axial symmetry, similar to Zr. This reveals a shape coexistence in neutron-rich Nb nuclei.</description>
