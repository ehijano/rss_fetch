      <title>Slow Dephasing of Coherent Optical Phonons in Two-dimensional Lead Organic Chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid organic-inorganic semiconductors with strong electron-phonon interactions provide a programmable platform for developing a variety of electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum materials by controlling these interactions. However, in current hybrid semiconductors, such as halide perovskites, anharmonic vibrations with rapid dephasing hinder the ability to coherently manipulate phonons. Here, we report the observation of long-lived coherent phonons in lead organic chalcogenides (LOCs), a new family of hybrid two-dimensional semiconductors. These materials feature harmonic phonon dynamics despite distorted lattices, combining long phonon dephasing times with tunable semiconducting properties. Dephasing time as long as 75 ps at 10 K, with up to 500 cycles of phonon oscillation between scattering events, was observed, corresponding to a dimensionless harmonicity parameter more than an order of magnitude larger than that of halide perovskites. The phonon dephasing time is significantly influenced by anharmonicity and centrosymmetry, both of which can be tuned through the design of the organic ligands thanks to the direct bonding between the organic and inorganic motifs. This research opens new opportunities for the manipulation of electronic properties with coherent phonons in hybrid semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Colossal magneto-excitonic effects in 2D van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D magnetic semiconductors, which intrinsically couple a rich landscape of magnetic orders with tightly bound electron-hole pairs (excitons), present an exciting platform to investigate the interplay between optical and magnetic phenomena at the atomic scale. In such systems, the strength of magneto-optical effects determines how deeply the magnetic properties can be revealed. Here, we report the observation of remarkably strong magneto-excitonic effects in the 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr that allow probing its magnetic order with unprecedented sensitivity. By investigating optical transitions above the fundamental exciton energy, we discover a massive spectral shift approaching 100 meV under applied magnetic fields -- an order of magnitude larger than previously observed magneto-excitonic responses. Our comprehensive magneto-optical experiments accompanied by detailed DFT calculations indicate the possible origin of the transitions exhibiting such intriguing behavior. These findings open avenues for exploiting magneto-excitonic phenomena at newly accessible regimes, enabling novel opto-spintronic applications previously limited by weak magnetic responses.</description>

      <title>From ferromagnetic semiconductor to anti-ferromagnetic metal in epitaxial Cr$_x$Te$_y$ monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromium ditelluride, CrTe$_2$, is an attractive candidate van der Waals material for hosting 2D magnetism. However, how the room-temperature ferromagnetism of the bulk evolves as the sample is thinned to the single-layer limit has proved controversial. This, in part, reflects its metastable nature, vs. a series of more stable self-intercalation compounds with higher relative Cr:Te stoichiometry. Here, exploiting a recently-developed method for enhancing nucleation in molecular beam epitaxy growth of transition-metal chalcogenides, we demonstrate the selective stabilisation of high-coverage CrTe$_2$ and Cr$_{2+\varepsilon}$Te$_3$ epitaxial monolayers. Combining X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and temperature-dependent angle-resolved photoemission, we demonstrate that both compounds order magnetically with a similar Tc. We find, however, that monolayer CrTe$_2$ forms as an anti-ferromagnetic metal, while monolayer Cr$_{2+\varepsilon}$Te$_3$ hosts an intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconducting state. This work thus demonstrates that control over the self-intercalation of metastable Cr-based chalcogenides provides a powerful route for tuning both their metallicity and magnetic structure, establishing the Cr-Te system as a flexible materials class for future 2D spintronics.</description>

      <title>Spin filtering with insulating altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) materials have recently attracted significant interest due to the non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting of their electronic band structure which may be useful for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. So far, however, most research studies have been focused on AM metals which can be utilized in spintronic devices, such as AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). At the same time, AM insulators have remained largely unexplored in the realm of AFM spintronics. Here, we propose to employ AM insulators (AMIs) as efficient spin-filter materials. By analyzing the complex band structure of rutile-type altermagnets $MF_2$ ($M$ = $Fe, Co, Ni$), we demonstrate that the evanescent states in these AMIs exhibit spin- and momentum-dependent decay rates resulting in a substantial momentum-dependent spin polarization of the tunneling current. Using a model of spin-filter tunneling across a spin-dependent potential barrier, we estimate the TMR effect in spin-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (SF-MTJs) that include two magnetically decoupled $MF_2$ (001) barrier layers. We predict a sizable spin-filter TMR ratio of about 150-170% in SF-MTJs based on AMIs $CoF_2$ and $NiF_2$ if the Fermi energy is tuned to be close to the valence band maximum. Our results demonstrate that AMIs provide a viable alternative to conventional ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic spin-filter materials, potentially advancing the development of next-generation AFM spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Measurements of dislocations in 4H-SiC with rocking curve imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4H Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) combines many attractive properties such as a high carrier mobility, a wide bandgap, and a high thermal conductivity, making it an ideal candidate for high-power electronic devices. However, a primary challenge in utilizing 4H-SiC is the presence of defects in epitaxial layers, which can significantly degrade device performance. In this study, we have used X-ray transmission topography with a rocking curve imaging technique to characterize the types and distribution of defects in 4H-SiC. The derived maps from the fitted Gaussian parameters were used to investigate dislocations in 4H-SiC. Understanding the distribution of the dislocations provides valuable insights into the overall crystal quality, which can guide improvements for the fabrication processes.</description>

      <title>Classical variational phase-field models cannot predict fracture nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notwithstanding the evidence against them, classical variational phase-field models continue to be used and pursued in an attempt to describe fracture nucleation in elastic brittle materials. In this context, the main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the existing evidence against such a class of models as descriptors of fracture nucleation. To that end, a review is first given of the plethora of experimental observations of fracture nucleation in nominally elastic brittle materials under quasi-static loading conditions, as well as of classical variational phase-field models, without and with energy splits. These models are then confronted with the experimental observations. The conclusion is that they cannot possibly describe fracture nucleation in general. This because classical variational phase-field models cannot account for material strength as an independent macroscopic material property. The last part of the paper includes a brief summary of a class of phase-field models that can describe fracture nucleation. It also provides a discussion of how pervasively material strength has been overlooked in the analysis of fracture at large, as well as an outlook into the modeling of fracture nucleation beyond the basic setting of elastic brittle materials.</description>

      <title>An NV- center in magnesium oxide as a spin qubit for hybrid quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent predictions suggest that oxides, such as MgO and CaO, could serve as hosts of spin defects with long coherence times and thus be promising materials for quantum applications. However, in most cases specific defects have not yet been identified. Here, by using a high-throughput first-principles framework and advanced electronic structure methods, we identify an NV-like center in MgO with favorable electronic and optical properties for hybrid quantum technologies. We show that this defect has stable triplet ground and excited states, with singlet shelving states enabling optical initialization and spin-dependent readout. We predict several properties, including absorption, emission, and zero-phonon line energies, as well as zero-field splitting tensor, and hyperfine interaction parameters, which can aid in the experimental identification of this defect. Our calculations show that due to a strong pseudo-Jahn Teller effect and low frequency phonon modes, the NV- center in MgO is subject to a substantial vibronic coupling. We discuss design strategies to reduce such coupling and increase the Debye-Waller factor, including the effect of strain and the localization of the defect states. We propose that the favorable properties of the NV- defect, along with the technological maturity of MgO, could enable hybrid classical-quantum applications, such as spintronic quantum sensors and single qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Phonon Thermal Conductivity Prediction by an Order of Magnitude Through Machine Learning-Assisted Extraction of Anharmonic Force Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of material phonon thermal conductivity from density functional theory calculations requires computationally expensive evaluation of anharmonic interatomic force constants and has remained a computational bottleneck in the high-throughput discovery of materials. In this work, we present a machine learning-assisted approach for the extraction of anharmonic force constants through local learning of the potential energy surface. We demonstrate our approach on a diverse collection of 220 ternary materials for which the total computational time for anharmonic force constants evaluation is reduced by more than an order of magnitude from 480,000 cpu-hours to less than 12,000 cpu-hours while preserving the thermal conductivity prediction accuracy to within 10%. Our approach removes a major hurdle in computational thermal conductivity evaluation and will pave the way forward for the high-throughput discovery of materials.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Water Structure in Room-Temperature Clathrate State: Hydrogen-Bonded Pentagonal Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water hydrogen bonding is extremely versatile; approximately 20 ice structures and several types of clathrate hydrate structures have been identified. These crystalline water structures form at temperatures below room temperature and/or at high pressure. We used transmission electron microscopy to study a new crystalline water structure in a clathrate state that is prepared by sandwiching gas-supersaturated water between graphene layers under ambient conditions. In this clathrate state, water molecules form a three-dimensional hydrogen bonding network that encloses gas-filled cages 2-4 nm in size. We derived the crystalline water structure by recording and analyzing electron diffraction patterns and performing first-principles calculations. The structure consists purely of pentagonal rings and has a topology similar to that of water ice XVII. The study proposed a mechanism for the formation of the clathrate state. The present results improve the understanding of interactions among water and small nonpolar molecules and offer novel insights into the local structures of ambient liquid water.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-object dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dispersion (van der Waals, vdW) interaction among N parallel elongated objects such as DNA/RNA strands or metallic nanotubes, which are polarizable primarily along the long axis. Within a quasi-one-dimensional model, we prove that the irreducible N -object vdW energy contribution is negative (attractive) for even N and positive (repulsive) for odd N. We confirm these results up to $N=4$ via a 3-dimensional plasma cylinder model. This suggests a preference for even-N clustering of elongated structures in nanoscience and biology. This work could have implications e.g. for nanotube bundle formation and for the clustering of long-chain biomolecules at separations exceeding chemical bond lengths.</description>

      <title>Bonding Interactions Can Drive Topological Phase Transitions in a Zintl Antiferromagnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While $\sim$30% of materials are reported to be topological, topological insulators are rare. Magnetic topological insulators (MTI) are even harder to find. Identifying crystallographic features that can host the coexistence of a topological insulating phase with magnetic order is vital for finding intrinsic MTI materials. Thus far, most materials that are investigated for the determination of an MTI are some combination of known topological insulators with a magnetic ion such as MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Motivated by the recent success of EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, we investigate the role of chemical pressure on topologically trivial insulator, Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ via Ga substitution. Eu$_5$Ga$_2$Sb$_6$ is predicted to be topological but is synthetically difficult to stabilize. We look into the intermediate compositions between Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ and Eu$_5$Ga$_2$Sb$_6$ through theoretical works to explore a topological phase transition and band inversion mechanism. We attribute the band inversion mechanism to changes in Eu-Sb hybridization as Ga is substituted for In due to chemical pressure. We also synthesize Eu$_{5}$In$_{4/3}$Ga$_{2/3}$Sb$_{6}$, the highest Ga concentration in Eu$_{5}$In$_{2-x}$Ga$_{x}$Sb$_{6}$, and report the thermodynamic, magnetic, transport, and Hall properties. Overall, our work paints a picture of a possible MTI via band engineering and explains why Eu-based Zintl compounds are suitable for the co-existence of magnetism and topology.</description>

      <title>High-Ti inducing local Eta-phase transformation and creep-twinning in CoNi-based superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitate shearing mechanisms during compressive creep of L12-containing CoNi-base alloys with different Ti/Al ratio have been investigated in this work. Interrupted creep tests were conducted at 950 degree under air with constant load stress of 241 MPa. It was found that the creep resistance increases with Ti/Al ratio rising in CoNi-based alloys. In addition, we firstly found that the type of planar defects on (111) planes during precipitate shearing change from antiphase boundary (APB) towards superlattice extrinsic stacking fault (SESF) with Ti content increasing - shearing of the gamma' phase is mainly dominated by APB in Ti-free and low-Ti alloys but dominated by SESF in high-Ti alloys. By employing density functional theory (DFT), the APB energy was found be lower than complex stacking fault (CSF) energy in Ti-free and low-Ti alloys but this situation becomes opposite in high-Ti containing alloys. Additionally, the SESF energy is lower than SISF energy in L12-(Co,Ni)3Ti structure strongly supporting SESFs formation in high-Ti alloys. By energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis under the scanning transmission electron microscope mode, the observed chemical segregation enables APB becoming disordered gamma phase structure in Ti-free and low-Ti alloys and enables SESF becoming local ordered Eta phase structure in high-Ti alloys. However, the microtwins were found as well in high-Ti alloys which usually contributes higher creep strain than other planar defects, e.g. SESF and APB. This finding provides a new insight how to use Ti content reasonably in superalloy design.</description>

      <title>Electrical contacts for high performance optoelectronic devices of BaZrS3 single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites such as BaZrS3 are promising candidates for next generation optoelectronics such as photodetectors and solar cells. Compared to widely studied polycrystalline thin films, single crystals of BaZrS3 with minimal extended and point defects, are ideal platform to study the material's intrinsic transport properties and to make first-generation optoelectronic devices. However, the surface dielectrics formed on BaZrS3 single crystals due to sulfating or oxidation have led to significant challenges to achieving high quality electrical contacts, and hence, realizing the high-performance optoelectronic devices. Here, we report the development of electrical contact fabrication processes on BaZrS3 single crystals, where various processes were employed to address the surface dielectric issue. Moreover, with optimized electrical contacts fabricated through dry etching, high-performance BaZrS3 photoconductive devices with a low dark current of 0.1 nA at 10 V bias and a fast transient photoresponse with rise and decay time of &lt;0.2 s were demonstrated. Our study emphasizes the importance of damage-free fabrication processes in making high-quality optoelectronic devices of BaZrS3 single crystals and sheds light on exploring its intrinsic transport properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy computational demands from artificial intelligence (AI) leads the research community to explore the design space for functional materials that can be used for high performance memory and neuromorphic computing hardware. Novel device technologies with specially engineered properties are under intense investigation to revolutionize information processing with brain-inspired computing primitives for ultra energy-efficient implementation of AI and machine learning tasks. Ferroelectric memories with ultra-low power and fast operation, non-volatile data retention and reliable switching to multiple polarization states promises one such option for non-volatile memory and synaptic weight elements in neuromorphic hardware. For quick adaptation of industry, new materials need complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process compatibility which brings a whole new set of challenges and opportunities for advanced materials design. In this work, we report on designing of back-end-of-line compatible ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 capacitors that are capable of recovery from fatigue multiple times reaching 2Pr &gt; 40 microC cm-2 upon each retrieval. Our results indicate that with specifically engineered material stack and annealing protocols, it is possible to reach endurance exceeding 10^9 cycles at room temperature that can lead to ultralow power ferroelectric non-volatile memory components or synaptic weight elements compatible with online training or inference tasks for neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Understanding Charge Transport in Single Molecule of Rhenium(I) Compounds: A Computational Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding electrical characteristics and corresponding transport models at single molecular junctions is crucial. There have been many reports on organic compounds-based single molecular junctions. However, organometallic compounds-based single molecular junctions have not been explored yet. Re(I) organometallic compounds are known to exhibit intriguing photophysical properties scrutinized for photocatalysis, and light-emitting diodes but have not been explored in molecular electronics. In this work, a theoretical model study on the I-V characteristics of two Re(I)-carbonyl complexes bearing Re-P and Re-N-N linkage has been meticulously chosen. Tunneling and hopping transport in Au/Re(I)-complex/Au single-molecule junctions are governed by Landauer-formalism and the Marcus theory, respectively. Interestingly, variations in molecular architecture culminate in notable variations in junction functionality and mechanism of charge conduction. Physical parameters influencing the device characteristics such as dipole moment, molecule-electrode coupling strength, voltage division factor, and temperature have been extensively studied which offers modulation of the characteristics and device design. The dominant hopping current in Re complex bearing bipyridine linkage was found to be responsible for the observed asymmetric electrical (I-V) behavior. Our work paves the way for constructing various organometallic compounds-based molecular junctions to understand electronic functions and the underlying transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Living porous ceramics for bacteria-regulated gas sensing and carbon capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, we report porous ceramics that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self-regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas-sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild-type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas-sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake and mechanical properties. Using state-of-the-art chemical analysis techniques, we demonstrate the ability of the living porous ceramics to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of a toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.</description>

      <title>Driving noncollinear interlayer exchange coupling intrinsically in magnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic side layers sandwiching a nonmagnetic spacer as a metallic trilayer has become a pivotal platform for achieving spintronic devices. Recent experiments demonstrate that manipulating the width or the nature of conducting spacer induces noncollinear magnetic alignment between the side layers. Our theoretical analysis reveals that altering the width of spacer significantly affects the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC), resulting in noncollinear alignment. Through analytic and first-principles methods, our study on the Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer shows that at a specific width of the Ag spacer, the magnetic moments of side layers tend to be perpendicular. This alignment is mediated by Ag quantum well states, exhibiting spin spirals across the trilayer. Our results reveal that the noncollinear IEC offers a degree of freedom to control magnetic devices and boot spintronic technology with improved transport capabilities.</description>

      <title>Overestimation of melting temperatures calculated by first-principles molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the melting temperature, $T_{m}$, of a solid can be calculated based on first-principles molecular dynamics (FP-MD) simulations, systematic assessments of the accuracy of the resulting values have not yet been reported. FP-MD simulations require significant computational resources and hence an examination of the effect of cell size on convergence is difficult. In addition, calculation of the energy of a liquid is not a trivial problem because of energy dissipation effects. The present work attempts to resolve these problems, and thus allow the accuracy of $T_{m}$ values obtained from FP-MD simulations to be assessed for typical semiconductors, metals, and oxides. With the exception of Si, the $T_{m}$ value was overestimated in all cases. This overestimation can be reduced by increasing the cell size, although the convergence is slow unless the potential is very shallow. For oxides, this overestimation may not be removed by increasing the cell size. The LDA/GGA error of overbinding affects the melting enthalpy and thereby $T_{m}$. In order to fully capture the energy dissipation nature of liquids, adiabatic MD simulations are required, and such simulations have been performed in the present study.</description>

      <title>Characterization and optimization of high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the photoconversion efficiency $\eta$ of the silicon-based solar cells (SCs) under laboratory conditions is approaching the theoretical fundamental limit, further improvement of their performance requires theoretical modeling and/or numerical simulation to optimize the SCs parameters and design. The existing numerical approaches to modeling and optimization of the key parameters of high-efficiency solar cells based on monocrystalline silicon (c-Si), the dominant material in photovoltaics, are described. It is shown that, in addition to the four usually considered recombination processes, namely, Shockley-Read-Hall, surface, radiative, and band-to-band Auger recombination mechanisms, the non-radiative exciton Auger recombination and recombination in the space charge region (SCR) have to be included. To develop the analytical SC characterization formalism, we proposed a simple expression to model the wavelength-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the photocurrent near the absorption edge. Based on this parameterization, the theory developed allows for calculating and optimizing the base thickness-dependent short-circuit current, the open-circuit voltage, and the SC photoconversion efficiency. We proved that the approach to optimize the solar cell parameters, especially its thickness and the base doping level, is accurate and demonstrated for the two Si solar cells reported in the literature, one with an efficiency of 26.7 % and the other with the record efficiency of 26.81 %. It is shown that the formalism developed allows further optimization of the solar cell thickness and doping level, thus increasing the SC efficiency to an even higher value.</description>

      <title>Enhanced room temperature ferromagnetism in nanostructured MoS2 flakes by hydrogen post-treatment: Combined experimental and first-principle-based studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We meticulously study the individual effects of hydrogen irradiation and annealing on the electronic structure and magnetic properties of nanostructured MoS2 thin films grown through Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). The role of edge-terminated structure and point defects to induce room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is thoroughly investigated. The nanostructured pristine MoS2 thin films show the formation of a pure 2-H MoS2 phase, confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. Pristine MoS2 thin films are independently annealed in a reducing hydrogen environment and irradiated with low-energy hydrogen ions to study the significance of point defects like sulfur vacancies. RTFM with saturation magnetization value (Ms: 1.66 emu/g) has been observed in the pristine film. Magnetization increases after irradiation and annealing processes. However, hydrogen annealing at a temperature of 200oC exhibits a maximum Ms value of 2.7 emu/g at room temperature. The increase in ferromagnetism is attributed to an increment in sulfur vacancies, hydrogen adsorption with sulfur, and modification in edges, which is confirmed by the analysis of Electron probe micro-analyzer (EPMA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) measurements. The Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that the edge-oriented structure of MoS2 exhibits a magnetization value of 3.2 {\mu}B. Additionally, introducing an S-vacancy and H-adsorption in a parallel position to the sulfur further enhances the magnetization value to 3.85 {\mu}B and 3.43 {\mu}B respectively. These findings align broadly with our experimental results.</description>

      <title>How to manipulate nanoparticle morphology with vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacking defects in noble metal nanoparticles significantly impact their optical, catalytic, and electrical properties. While some mechanisms behind their formation have been studied, the ability to deliberately manipulate nanoparticle bulk morphology remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a pioneering mechanism - vacancy-driven twinning - that enables the transformation of face-centered cubic (fcc) gold into locally hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures. This innovative approach, demonstrated through computational simulations, facilitates the creation of realistic , randomly multi-twinned nanoparticle models. By employing a recently developed multidomain X-ray diffraction method (MDXRD), we quantitatively assess the degree of twinning. It is a crucial step in transferring theoretical studies into practical applications. Our work aims to develop tools for modifying and controlling the bulk structure of fcc nanoparticles</description>

      <title>Two-junction model in different percolation regimes of silver nanowires networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random networks offer fertile ground for achieving complexity and criticality, both crucial for an unconventional computing paradigm inspired by biological brains' features. In this work, we focus on characterizing and modeling different electrical transport regimes of self-assemblies of silver nanowires (AgNWs). As percolation plays an essential role in such a scenario, we explore a broad range of areal density coverage. Close-to-percolation realizations (usually used to demonstrate neuromorphic computing capabilities) have large pristine resistance and require an electrical activation. Up to now, highly conductive over-percolated systems (commonly used in electrode fabrication technology) have not been thoroughly considered for hardware-based neuromorphic applications, though biological systems exhibit such an extremely high degree of interconnections. Here, we show that high current densities in over-percolated low-resistance AgNW networks induce a fuse-type process, allowing a switching operation. Such electro-fusing discriminates between weak and robust NW-to-NW links and enhances the role of filamentary junctions. Their reversible resistive switching enable different conductive paths exhibiting linear I-V features. We experimentally study both percolation regimes and propose a model comprising two types of junctions that can describe, through numerical simulations, the overall behavior and observed phenomenology. These findings unveil a potential interplay of functionalities of neuromorphic systems and transparent electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are known for their various compositions and multifunctional properties including topological phases. In this study, we investigate the topological classification of this class of materials based on the ordering of the $\Gamma_6$, $\Gamma_8$ states, and a previously overlooked $\Gamma_6^*$ state, during an adiabatic expansion process. Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, we observed that the non-trivial topology is governed by a three-band mechanism. We provide a simple model derived from $k\cdot p$ Hamiltonian that interprets the topological phase in half-Heusler systems. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the topological phase under tension and a new perspective on the topological nature of half-Heusler compounds.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the impact of organic cation passivation on structural and optoelectronic properties of two-dimensional perovskites thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several organic cations have been used to passivate perovskite films; however, selecting the optimal cation remains challenging. In this work, we carried out density functional theory calculations to understand the effects induced by 17 different organic cations on the passivation (P-cations) of thin two-dimensional P2MAn-1PbnI3n+1 perovskites films, where n = 1 and 2. We found that the interactions between different types of P-cations and the inorganic slab affect the length and angles of the bonds within the inorganic framework (PbI6-octahedra). In general, the binding mechanism includes the interactions of organic cations with the inorganic framework, which leads to the accumulation of electron density within the halides, indicative of Bronsted--Lowry acid-base interactions. Oxygenated groups facilitate additional H-bond formation through -OH and -COOH groups, promoting the localization of the electron density between layers and improving the energetic stability of the system. Based on the results and analysis, we found that three P-cations might have higher potential for real-life applications, namely 4-fluorophenylethylammonium (FPEA), phenylethylammonium (PEA) and butylammonium (BtA).</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach for vibronically renormalized electronic band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) method for efficient computation of vibrational thermal expectation values of physical properties from first principles. Our approach is based on the non-perturbative frozen phonon formulation in which stochastic Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to sample configurations of nuclei in a supercell at finite temperatures based on a first-principles phonon model. A deep-learning neural network is trained to accurately predict physical properties associated with sampled phonon configurations, thus bypassing the time-consuming {\em ab initio} calculations. To incorporate the point-group symmetry of the electronic system into the ML model, group-theoretical methods are used to develop a symmetry-invariant descriptor for phonon configurations in the supercell. We apply our ML approach to compute the temperature dependent electronic energy gap of silicon based on density functional theory (DFT). We show that, with less than a hundred DFT calculations for training the neural network model, an order of magnitude larger number of sampling can be achieved for the computation of the vibrational thermal expectation values. Our work highlights the promising potential of ML techniques for finite temperature first-principles electronic structure methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical switching (AOS) involves manipulating magnetization using only pulsed laser, presenting a promising approach for next-generation magnetic recording devices. NiCo2O4 (NCO) thin films, a rare-earth-free ferrimagnetic oxide, exhibit a high Curie temperature and strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. This study demonstrates AOS in NCO thin films at room temperature using long-duration laser pulses and high repetition rates. Unlike previous findings, the AOS phenomena we report here are helicity-dependent and observable with an ultrashort pulsed laser. Consequently, two distinct types of AOS can be observed in a single NCO thin film, contingent on the characteristics of the laser pulses and temperature.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Lanthanide Intercalation into Graphite Catalyzed by Na</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanides ($Ln$) are notoriously difficult to intercalate into graphite. We investigated the possibility of using Na to catalyze the formation of $Ln$-intercalated graphite and successfully synthesized $Ln$C$_6$ ($Ln$ = Sm, Eu, and Yb) significantly rapidly in high yields. The synthesis process involves the formation of the reaction intermediate NaC$_x$, through the mixing of Na and C, which subsequently reacts with $Ln$ upon heating to form $Ln$C$_6$. Well-sintered $Ln$C$_6$ pellets with low residual Na concentrations ($Ln$:Na = 98:2) were fabricated by the two-step method.

      <title>Spontaneous curvature in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consist of different 2D crystals with diverse properties, constituting the cornerstone of the new generation of 2D electronic devices. Yet interfaces in heterostructures inevitably break bulk symmetry and structural continuity, resulting in delicate atomic rearrangements and novel electronic structures. In this paper, we predict that 2D interfaces undergo spontaneous curvature, which means when two flat 2D layers approach each other, they inevitably experience out-of-plane curvature. Based on deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we observed significant out-of-plane displacements up to 3.8 angstrom in graphene/BN bilayers induced by curvature, producing a stable hexagonal moire pattern, which agrees well with experimentally observations. Additionally, the out-of-plane flexibility of 2D crystals enables the propagation of curvature throughout the system, thereby influencing the mechanical properties of the heterostructure. These findings offer fundamental insights into the atomic structure in 2D vdW heterostructures and pave the way for their applications in devices.</description>

      <title>Polarizable Continuum Models and Green's Function $\bf{GW}$ Formalism: On the Dynamics of the Solvent Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The many-body $GW$ formalism, for the calculation of ionization potentials or electronic affinities, relies on the frequency-dependent dielectric function built from the electronic degrees of freedom. Considering the case of water as a solvent treated within the polarizable continuum model, we explore the impact of restricting the full frequency-dependence of the solvent electronic dielectric response to a frequency-independent $(\epsilon_\infty)$ optical dielectric constant. For solutes presenting small to large highest-occupied to lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital energy gaps, we show that such a restriction induces errors no larger than a few percent on the energy level shifts from the gas to the solvated phase. We further introduce a remarkably accurate single-pole model for mimicking the effect of the full frequency dependence of the water dielectric function in the visible-UV range. This allows a fully dynamical embedded $GW$ calculation with the only knowledge of the cavity reaction field calculated for the $\epsilon_\infty$ optical dielectric constant.</description>

      <title>Boron Isotope Effects on Raman Scattering in Bulk BN, BP, and BAs: A Density-Functional Theory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many materials, Raman spectra are intricately structured and provide valuable information about compositional stoichiometry and crystal quality. Here we use density-functional theory calculations, mass approximation, and the Raman intensity weighted $\Gamma$-point density of state approach to analyze Raman scattering and vibrational modes in zincblende, wurtzite, and hexagonal BX (X = N, P, and As) structures. The influence of crystal structure and boron isotope disorder on Raman line shapes is examined. Our results demonstrate that long-range Coulomb interactions significantly influence the evolution of Raman spectra in cubic and wurtzite BN compounds. With the evolution of the compositional rate from $^{11}$B to $^{10}$B, a shift toward higher frequencies, as well as the maximum broadening and asymmetry of the Raman peaks, is expected around the 1:1 ratio. The calculated results are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data. This study serves as a guide for understanding how crystal symmetry and isotope disorder affect phonons in BX compounds, which are relevant to quantum single-photon emitters, heat management, and crystal quality assessments.</description>

      <title>Field-free superconducting diode effect in layered superconductor FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), where zero-resistance states appear nonreciprocally during current injection, is receiving tremendous interest in both fundamental and applied physics because the SDE is a novel manifestation of symmetry breaking and enables the creation of a novel diode without energy loss. In particular, magnetic-field-free SDEs have been extensively investigated because of their potential to serve as building blocks for superconducting circuit technology. In this letter, we report the field-free SDE in a layered superconductor, FeSe. Its underlying physics is clarified by systematic controlled experiments to be an interplay of a large thermoelectric response and geometrical asymmetry in FeSe. Our findings can pave a new avenue for the construction of novel material and device platforms utilizing SDEs.</description>

      <title>Correlating grain boundary character and composition in 3-dimensions using 4D-scanning precession electron diffraction and atom probe tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundaries are dominant imperfections in nanocrystalline materials that form a complex 3-dimensional (3D) network. Solute segregation to grain boundaries is strongly coupled to the grain boundary character, which governs the stability and macroscopic properties of nanostructured materials. Here, we develop a 3-dimensional transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography correlation framework to retrieve the grain boundary character and composition at the highest spatial resolution and chemical sensitivity by correlating four-dimensional scanning precession electron diffraction tomography (4D-SPED) and atom probe tomography (APT) on the same sample. We obtain the 3D grain boundary habit plane network and explore the preferential segregation of Cu and Si in a nanocrystalline Ni-W alloy. The correlation of structural and compositional information reveals that Cu segregates predominantly along high angle grain boundaries and incoherent twin boundaries, whereas Si segregation to low angle and incommensurate grain boundaries is observed. The novel full 3D correlative approach employed in this work opens up new possibilities to explore the 3D crystallographic and compositional nature of nanomaterials. This lays the foundation for both probing the true 3D structure-chemistry at the sub-nanometer scale and, consequentially, tailoring the macroscopic properties of advanced nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>A DFT+$U$+$V$ study of pristine and oxygen-deficient HfO$_2$ with self-consistent Hubbard parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HfO$_2$-based ferroelectrics have emerged as promising materials for advanced nanoelectronics, with their robust polarization and silicon compatibility making them ideal for high-density, non-volatile memory applications. Oxygen vacancies, particularly in positively charged states, are suggested to profoundly impact the polymorphism kinetics and phase stability of hafnia, thereby affecting its ferroelectric behavior. The electronic structures of pristine and oxygen-deficient hafnia polymorph have been extensively studied using density functional theory, primarily employing (semi-)local exchange-correlation functionals. However, these methods often underestimate band gaps and may not accurately capture the localized nature of $d$-electrons. In this work, we investigate hafnia in various phases using DFT + $U$ + $V$, with onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ Hubbard parameters computed self-consistently via the pseudohybrid Hubbard density functional, ACBN0, and its extended version eACBN0. We find that the self-consistent DFT + $U$ method provides comparable accuracy to the computationally more expensive Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid density functional in predicting relative thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and density of states. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective approach for estimating the formation energies of oxygen vacancies. Additionally, we demonstrate that environmentally dependent Hubbard parameters serve as useful indicators for analyzing bond strengths and electronic structures in real space.</description>

      <title>Accurate Description of Charge-Orbital-Spin in Complex Functional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex materials, characterized by geometrical or electronic complexities, catalyze the emergence of various intriguing functionalities. At the atomic level, these materials typically feature intricate and competing bond orders associated with d-orbitals, providing a rich test bed for assessing the capabilities of density functional theory (DFT). The Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional has been shown to outperform traditional density functionals in modeling a diverse range of chemical bonds, marking a significant advancement in DFT. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of SCAN in simulating the electronic properties of displacive ferroelectrics, magnetoelectric multiferroics, and cuprate high-temperature superconductors, which encompass a broad spectrum of bonding characteristics. We demonstrate how SCAN addresses challenging simulations involving (1) anisotropic bonding with geometrical symmetry breaking, (2) bonding hybridization of localized open d-shells, and (3) variable electronic states on the boundary of localization-insulator to itinerant-metal transitions. We also show how the advanced functional captures the complex bonds by analyzing the intricate electron densities, offering an intuitive understanding of SCAN's operational principles. Our insights have practical implications for the computational materials science community, potentially guiding the broader adoption of SCAN in modeling complex functional materials.</description>

      <title>Achieving ultra-high anisotropy in thermal conductivity of plastic crystal through megapascal pressure of hot pressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic crystals, owing to their exceptional properties, are gradually finding applications in solid-state refrigeration and ferroelectric fields. However, their inherently low thermal conductivity restricts their utilization in electronic devices. This study demonstrates that applying megapascal pressure of hot pressing can enhance the thermal conductivity of plastic crystal films. Most importantly, it induces significant anisotropy in thermal conductivity. Such anisotropy in thermal conductivity is beneficial for specialized thermal management applications, such as directing heat flow paths in electronic devices. In this study, [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] PCs films were prepared by hot pressing. At a pressure of 16 MPa, the ratio of in-plane to cross-plane thermal conductivity in the film reaches a remarkable 5.5. This is attributed to the preferential orientation along the (002) crystal plane induced by uniaxial pressure, leading to the formation of a layered structure and the creation of a flat and dense film. Furthermore, according to molecular dynamics simulations, the thermal conductivity along the [100] and [010] directions (parallel to the (002) crystal plane) is higher than in other directions. Therefore, significant modulation of anisotropy in thermal conductivity is achieved in [(CH3)4N][FeCl4] films by applying uniaxial hot pressing pressure. This phenomenon has the potential to greatly broaden the application of plastic crystals in the field of flexible electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Creation of an Fe$_3$P Schreibersite Density Functional Tight Binding Model for Astrobiological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mineral schreibersite, e.g., Fe$_3$P, is commonly found in iron-rich meteorites and could have served as an abiotic phosphorus source for prebiotic chemistry. However, atomistic calculations of its degradation chemistry generally require quantum simulation approaches, which can be too computationally cumbersome to study sufficient time and length scales for this process. In this regard, we have created a computationally efficient semi-empirical quantum Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) model for iron and phosphorus-containing materials by adopting an existing semi-automated workflow that represents many-body interactions by linear combinations of Chebyshev polynomials. We have utilized a relatively small training set to optimize a DFTB model that is accurate for schreibersite physical and chemical properties, including its bulk properties, surface energies, and water absorption. We then show that our model shows strong transferability to several iron phosphide solids as well as multiple allotropes of iron metal. Our resulting DFTB parameterization will allow us to interrogate schreibersite aqueous decomposition at longer time and length scales than standard quantum approaches, allowing for investigations of its role in prebiotic chemistry on early Earth.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-conductance in thin wires often exhibits complicated patterns due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons. These patterns reflect microscopic structures in the wires, such as defects or potential distributions. In this study, we propose an inverse design method to automatically generate a microscopic structure that exhibits desired magneto-conductance patterns. We numerically demonstrate that our method accurately generates defect positions in wires and can be effectively applied to various complicated patterns. We also discuss techniques for designing structures that facilitate experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Revealing subterahertz atomic vibrations in quantum paraelectrics by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding surface collective dynamics in quantum materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to play an essential role in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz (THz), is challenging due to limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 by developing surface-sensitive spintronic THz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 THz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3 broadens significantly below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub-meV phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study structural, magnetic and magneto-thermal properties of GdRhIn compound. The room temperature X-ray diffraction measurements show hexagonal crystal structure. Temperature and field dependence of magnetization suggest two magnetic transitions antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic at 16 K and ferromagnetic to paramagnetic at 34. The heat capacity measurements confirm both the magnetic transitions in GdRhIn. The magnetization data was used to calculate isothermal magnetic entropy change and refrigerant capacity in GdRhIn, which was found to be 10.3 J/Kg-K for the field change of 70 kOe and 282 J/Kg for the field change of 50 kOe, respectively. The large magnetocaloric effect in GdRhIn suggests that the material could be used for magnetic refrigeration at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Embedding theory contributions to average atom models for warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling in the warm dense matter regime is a persistent challenge with the most detailed models such as quantum molecular dynamics and path integral Monte Carlo being immensely computationally expensive. Density functional theory (DFT)-based average atom models (AAM) offer significant speed-ups in calculation times while still retaining fair accuracy in evaluating equations of state, mean ionizations, and more. Despite their success, AAMs struggle to precisely account for electronic interactions -- in particular, they do not account for effects on the kinetic energy arising from overlaps in neighboring atom densities. We aim to enhance these models by including such interactions via the non-additive kinetic potential $v^{\rm nadd}$ as in DFT embedding theories. $v^{\rm nadd}$ can be computed using Thomas-Fermi, von Weizs\"acker, or more sophisticated kinetic energy functionals. The proposed model introduces $v^{\rm nadd}$ as a novel interaction term in existing ion-correlation models, which include interactions beyond the central atom. We have applied this model to hydrogen at 5 eV and densities ranging 0.008 to 0.8 g/cm$^3$, and investigated the effects of $v^{\rm nadd}$ on electron densities, Kohn-Sham energy level shifts, mean ionization, and total energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a few methods for the determination of depth-resolved strain distributions each with inherent limitations are available, tomographic reconstruction has been applied to this problem in only a limited sense. One of the challenges was the potential impact of geometric parallax, which constitutes a non-negligible lateral offset of diffraction information arising from different sample depths at the detector. Here, the effect of parallax was investigated and two main results have emerged. First, the impact of parallax was found to be additive to other offset contributions, which implies a straightforward correction. Second, for tomographic scans utilizing a full 360{\deg} rotation parallax has been found to have no impact on reconstructions of angular information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution x-ray microscopy requires a high photon flux to measure the signal from weakly scattering samples. This exposes samples to high radiation doses, potentially damaging or destroying them through radiation damage. In this work, we propose the use of annular optics in scanning microscopy as an alternative to full-aperture optics. Annular optics act as high-pass filters. Compared to regular optics with the same numerical aperture, annular optics expose the sample to less dose while producing the same signal from small sample features. Annular optics benefit significantly from the high photon fluxes of the latest x-ray sources to compensate for their overall smaller cross section. Using numerical simulations, we show that annular optics offer superior optical performance for sample features close to the resolution limit of the optic.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in the van der Walls material $\rm NiPS_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the magnetic excitation spectrum of the quantum magnet $\rm NiPS_3$ near the zig-zag ground state of a minimal honeycomb spin Hamiltonian that includes bilinear and biquadratic spin interactions. Our analysis, using a multi-boson generalized spin wave theory suited for spin S=1 systems, revealed two normal modes at the linear level. The one at lower energy corresponds to a single magnon mode, consistent with results from spectroscopy experiments. Without single-ion anisotropy, this mode features a Goldstone mode at the corner of the Brillouin zone. When single ion anisotropy is introduced, the zig-zag phase's global U(1) invariance is broken, resulting in a gap. The higher energy mode corresponds to two-magnon fluctuations, which appear at the harmonic level in the generalized spin wave theory. This mode forms a gapped flat band due to bilinear spin interactions and becomes dispersive when biquadratic interactions are considered. The higher energy dispersion is related to quadrupolar fluctuations, which are feasible in magnets where the order parameter fluctuates in the SU(3) space. The spectrum analysis yielded quantum corrections to the order parameter and detected instabilities in the $\rm NiPS_3$ dipolar phases. Identifying the highest energy branch in experiments could provide insight into hidden nematic orders in $\rm NiPS_3$ and other van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Potential of Raman scattering in probing magnetic excitations and their coupling to lattice dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raman scattering is an excellent method for simultaneously determining the dynamics of lattice, spin, and charge degrees of freedom. Furthermore, polarization selection rules in Raman scattering enable momentum-resolved quasiparticle dynamics. In this review, we highlight the potential of Raman scattering in probing magnetic quasiparticles or excitations in various magnetic materials. We demonstrate how temperature-dependent Raman scattering data can confirm the existence of magnons in long-range ordered magnets and fractionalized excitations in Kitaev spin liquid candidates. To make this review easily understandable to novices, we provide background information on magnons and fractionalized excitations, and explain how they become visible in the Raman scattering process. We also show how to estimate magnetic exchange interactions from the data. For both types of magnetic materials, we discuss the impact of spin-phonon coupling on the lineshape of the phonon modes. In terms of materials, we present magnetic Raman scattering data of antiferromagnetic Sr2IrO4 and La2CuO4, ferromagnetic CrI3 monolayers, and Kitaev spin liquid candidates {\alpha}-RuCl3 and \b{eta}-Li2IrO3. Overall, our review demonstrates the versatility of the Raman scattering technique in probing quasiparticles in magnetic quantum materials. The review aims to inform young experimental researchers about the potential of Raman scattering, thereby motivating them to use this technique in their research.</description>

      <title>A novel effective technique for charge neutralization on bulk insulator surfaces in XPS measurements by introducing UV light irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When XPS analyses are performed on insulator surfaces, shift and deformation of spectra peaks typically take place due to the surface charging. To achieve reliable XPS measurements, neutralization techniques have been widely adopted but their effectiveness are still limited, and thus, new neutralization technologies are urgently needed. Here, stable XPS spectra in which all the peaks undergo a reduced and nearly constant shift without significant deformation and broadening were obtained by introducing the UV light irradiation, implying that the introduction of the UV light can not only greatly attenuate the strength but also significantly improve both the temporal stability and the spatial uniformity of the surface charging during XPS measurements. This phenomenon, referred to as UV-assisted neutralization in this article, was found as effective as the most commonly used dual beam charge neutralization. Further observations show that the suppression of the charging issue comes from the adsorption of the UV-excited photoelectrons onto the X-ray irradiation region. This neutralization method, combined with the binding energy referencing, can be expected to become a promising alternative technique for solving the charging issues in XPS measurements.</description>

      <title>Percolation in semicontinuum geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study percolation problems of overlapping objects where the underlying geometry is such that in D-dimensions, a subset of the directions has a lattice structure, while the remaining directions have a continuum structure. The resulting semicontinuum problem describes the percolation of overlapping shapes in parallel layers or lanes with positional constraints for the placement of the objects along the discrete directions. Several semicontinuum percolation systems are analyzed like hypercuboids with a particular focus on 2D and 3D cases, disks, and parallelograms. Adapting the excluded volume arguments to the semicontinuum setting, we show that for the semicontinuum problem of hypercuboids, for fixed side-lengths of the hypercuboids along the directions in which a lattice structure is maintained, the percolation threshold is always independent of the side-lengths along the continuum directions. The result holds even when there is a distribution for the side-lengths along the continuum directions. Trends in the variation of the thresholds, as we vary the linear measure of the shapes along the continuum directions, are obtained for other semicontinuum models like disks and parallelograms in 2D. The results are compared with those of corresponding continuum and lattice models. For the 2D and 3D models considered, using Monte Carlo simulations, we verify the excluded volume predictions for the trends and numerical values of the percolation thresholds. Very good agreement is seen between the predicted numerical values and the simulation results. The semicontinuum setting also allows us to establish a connection between the percolation problem of overlapping shapes in 2D continuum and triangular lattice. We also verify that the isotropy of the threshold for anisotropic shapes and standard percolation universality class is maintained in the semicontinuum setting.</description>

      <title>Broadband light extraction from near-surface NV centers using crystalline-silicon antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~20 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~4 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient solid-state photon emitters with longer operating lifetimes in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range are crucial for optoelectronic devices. However, finding suitable material candidates has been a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that hexagonal aluminum nitride (AlN) monolayers exhibit strong photoluminescence emission within the UV range of 3.94 - 4.05 eV. We show that these emissions in indirect bandgap AlN are facilitated by phonon modes with finite lattice momentum. These phonon modes promote efficient recombination of electrons and holes from the $\Gamma$ to K point of the Brillouin zone. Our findings provide a foundation for developing advanced optoelectronic devices and efficient UV light sources based on hexagonal AlN monolayers.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of the Future of Atomically Precise Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically Precise Manufacturing (APM) refers to the assembly of materials with atomic precision, representing a highly advanced technology with significant potential. However, the development of APM remains in its early stages, with applications largely confined to specialized fields and lacking cohesion within a unified discipline. The current literature on APM is often dominated by older, speculative papers that discuss its immense potential risks and benefits without sufficient grounding in the latest advancements or practical limitations that exist today. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive assessment of current APM and near-APM technologies, as well as using the barriers to further progress to predict future developments. Through this analysis, we seek to establish a clearer understanding of the present state of the technology and then use these insights to predict the future trajectory of APM. By doing so, we aim to create a more grounded discourse on APM and its potential risks and benefits, while also guiding future research on the necessary regulations and safety considerations for this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Construction of High-Fidelity Graph Deep Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become an indispensable tool in large-scale atomistic simulations because of their ability to reproduce ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs) very accurately at a fraction of computational cost. For computational efficiency, the training data for most MLPs today are computed using relatively cheap density functional theory (DFT) methods such as the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) functional. Meta-GGAs such as the recently developed strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional have been shown to yield significantly improved descriptions of atomic interactions for diversely bonded systems, but their higher computational cost remains an impediment to their use in MLP development. In this work, we outline a data-efficient multi-fidelity approach to constructing Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet) interatomic potentials that integrate different levels of theory within a single model. Using silicon and water as examples, we show that a multi-fidelity M3GNet model trained on a combined dataset of low-fidelity GGA calculations with 10% of high-fidelity SCAN calculations can achieve accuracies comparable to a single-fidelity M3GNet model trained on a dataset comprising 8x the number of SCAN calculations. This work paves the way for the development of high-fidelity MLPs in a cost-effective manner by leveraging existing low-fidelity datasets.</description>

      <title>Simulating strong-field electron-hole dynamics in solids probed by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast electron dynamics of a model of a wide-bandgap material with inner, valence, and conduction bands excited by an intense few-femtosecond pump and monitored by a delayed attosecond extreme-ultraviolet probe pulse. Complementary computational methods are utilized and compared, based on the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). TDDFT is employed to study a finite-size system, while the SBEs are utilized to investigate the corresponding solid with periodic boundary conditions imposed, with the crystal-momentum-dependent energy bands and interband couplings calculated in the parallel-transport structure gauge. The resulting strong-field electron dynamics are employed to predict experimentally accessible attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) signals as a function of the probe-pulse frequency and pump-probe interpulse delay. Both simulation protocols similarly capture the time-delay-dependent spectral features in the ATAS signals. The very good agreement between our TDDFT and SBE-based results allows us to interpret the ab-initio TDDFT simulations in terms of SBEs' interband couplings, validating our SBE-based model and corroborating its conclusions.</description>

      <title>Generating Approximate Ground States of Strongly Correlated Quantum Many-Body Systems Through Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most quantum algorithms designed to generate or probe properties of the ground state of a quantum many-body system require as input an initial state with a large overlap with the desired ground state. One approach for preparing such a ground state is Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Recent work by [Motta, M., Sun, C., Tan, A.T.K. et al. (2020)] introduced an algorithm -- which we will refer to as Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) -- that shows how ITE can be approximated by a sequence of unitary operators, making QITE potentially implementable on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we provide a heuristic study of the capabilities of the QITE algorithm in approximating the ITE of lattice and molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. We numerically study the performance of the QITE algorithm when provided with a good classical initial state for a large class of systems, some of which are of interest to industrial applications, and check if QITE is able to qualitatively replicate the ITE behavior and improve over a classical mean-field solution. The systems we consider in this work range from one- and two-dimensional lattice systems of various lattice geometries displaying short- and long-range interactions, to active spaces of molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. In addition to the comparison of QITE and ITE, we explicitly show how imaginary time evolved fermionic Gaussian states can serve as initial states which can be efficiently computed on classical computers and efficiently implemented on quantum computers for generic spin Hamiltonians in arbitrary lattice geometries and dimensions, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Striped magnetization plateau and chirality-reversible anomalous Hall effect in a magnetic kagome metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials with magnetic frustration in two-dimensional networks are known for their exotic properties, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with non-collinear spin textures. However, the effects of one-dimensional (1D) spin chains within these networks are less understood. Here, we report a distinctive AHE in the bilayer-distorted kagome material GdTi$_3$Bi$_4$, featuring 1D Gd zigzag spin chains, a one-third magnetization plateau, and two successive metamagnetic transitions. At these metamagnetic transitions, Hall resistivity shows abrupt jumps linked to the formation of stripe domain walls, while within the plateau, the absence of detectable domain walls suggests possible presence of skyrmion phase. Reducing the sample size to a few microns reveals additional Hall resistivity spikes, indicating domain wall skew scattering contributions. Magnetic atomistic spin dynamics simulations reveal that the magnetic textures at these transitions have reverse chirality, explaining the evolution of AHE and domain walls with fields. These results underscore the potential of magnetic and crystal symmetry interplay, and magnetic field-engineered spin chirality, for controlling domain walls and tuning transverse properties, advancing spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dielectric Relaxation in Semicrystalline Polymers -- Understanding the Role of the Interphase between the Amorphous and Crystalline Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semicrystalline polymers (SCP) represent important class of materials used in many applications from packaging to transportation to electronics to pharmaceuticals. Understanding the structure and dynamics of the crystalline and amorphous fractions within SCP is an important challenge for both experimentalists and theoreticians. Recently, Cheng et al. (S. Cheng et al., J. Chem. Phys. 160, 114904 (2024)) utilized Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS) to explore the relaxation time profiles within the amorphous region of a semi-crystalline poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) with ordered alternative stacking of crystalline/amorphous phases. Here, we build on those initial results and model the relaxation time distribution using the combination of the Doolittle free volume theory (FVT) and the compressible Self-Consistent Field Theory (cSCFT). We show that the new modeling framework successfully captures the temperature and position dependence of the local relaxation time of the semicrystalline PLLA above the glass transition temperature of the amorphous region. Finally, we derive a new empirical equation for the relaxation time profiles in amorphous regions of SCPs.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Skin Effect through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian Correspondence and Its Observation in an Acoustic Kagome Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive topological phenomenon observed in nonHermitian systems. Recently, there has been considerable interest in exploring higher-order NHSE occurrences in two and three dimensions. In such systems, topological edge states collapse into a corner while bulk states remain delocalized. Through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian correspondence, this study predicts and experimentally observes the higher-order NHSE in an acoustic Kagome lattice possessing nonreciprocal hoppings. By rotating the frequency spectrum and employing complexfrequency excitation techniques, we observe the localization of acoustic energy towards a corner of the lattice in the topologically nontrivial phase, even when the source is located far from that corner. In contrast, the acoustic energy spreads out when excited at the frequencies hosting the bulk states. These observations are unequivocal evidence of the higher-order NHSE.</description>

      <title>Double-network-inspired mechanical metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials are renowned for their ability to achieve high stiffness and strength at low densities, often at the expense of low ductility and stretchability-a persistent trade-off in materials. In contrast, materials such as double-network hydrogels feature interpenetrating compliant and stiff polymer networks, and exhibit unprecedented combinations of high stiffness and stretchability, resulting in exceptional toughness. Here, we present double-network-inspired (DNI) metamaterials by integrating monolithic truss (stiff) and woven (compliant) components into a metamaterial architecture, which achieve a tenfold increase in stiffness and stretchability compared to their pure woven and truss counterparts, respectively. Nonlinear computational mechanics models elucidate that enhanced energy dissipation in these DNI metamaterials stems from increased frictional dissipation due to entanglements between the two networks. Through introduction of internal defects, which typically degrade mechanical properties, we demonstrate an opposite effect of a threefold increase in energy dissipation for these metamaterials via failure delocalization. This work opens avenues for developing new classes of metamaterials in a high-compliance regime inspired by polymer network topologies.</description>

      <title>Deep Band Crossings Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) effects in materials with band crossings have attracted significant research interests due to the divergent band geometric quantities around these crossings. Most current research has focused on band crossings between the valence and conduction bands. However, such crossings are absent in insulators, which are more relevant for NLO applications. In this work, we demonstrate that NLO effects can be significantly enhanced by band crossings within the valence or conduction bands, which we designate as "deep band crossings" (DBCs). As an example, in two dimensions, we show that shift conductivity can be substantially enhanced or even divergent due to a mirror-protected "deep Dirac nodal point". In three dimensions, we propose GeTe as an ideal material where shift conductivity is enhanced by "deep Dirac nodal lines". The ubiquity of this enhancement is further confirmed by high-throughput calculations. Other types of DBCs and NLO effects are also discussed. By manipulating band crossings between arbitrary bands, our work offers a simple, practical, and universal way to greatly enhance NLO effects.</description>

      <title>Simple H\"uckel Molecular Orbital Theory for M\"obius Carbon Nanobelts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently synthesized M\"obius carbon nanobelts (CNBs) have gained attention owing to their unique $\pi$-conjugation topology, which results in distinctive electronic properties with both fundamental and practical implications. Although M\"obius conjugation with phase inversion in atomic orbital (AO) basis is well-established for monocyclic systems, the extension of this understanding to double-stranded M\"obius CNBs remains uncertain. This study thoroughly examines the simple H\"uckel molecular orbital (SHMO) theory for describing the $\pi$ electronic structures of M\"obius CNBs. We demonstrate that the adjacency matrix for any M\"obius CNB is isomorphism invariant under different placements of the sign inversion, ensuring identical SHMO results regardless of AO phase inversion location. Representative examples of M\"obius CNBs, including the experimentally synthesized one, show that the H\"uckel molecular orbitals (MOs) strikingly resemble the DFT-computed $\pi$ MOs, which were obtained using a herein proposed technique based on the localization and re-delocalization of DFT canonical MOs. Interestingly, the lower-lying $\pi$ MOs exhibit an odd number of nodal planes and are doubly quasidegenerate as a consequence of the phase inversion in M\"obius macrocycles, contrasting with macrocyclic H\"uckel systems. Coulson bond orders derived from SHMO theory correlate well with DFT-calculated Wiberg bond indices for all C-C bonds in tested M\"obius CNBs. Additionally, a remarkable correlation is observed between HOMO-LUMO gaps obtained from the SHMO and GFN2-xTB calculations for a large number of topoisomers of M\"obius CNBs. Thus, the SHMO model not only captures the essence of $\pi$ electronic structure of M\"obius CNBs, but also provides reliable quantitative predictions comparable to DFT results.</description>

      <title>Proximity to an orbital order with charge disorder state in optimally-doped \textit{RE}\textsubscript{5/8}Ca\textsubscript{3/8}MnO\textsubscript{3} perovskites</title>

Abstract: The evolution of charge and orbital ordering phenomena in optimally-doped \textit{RE}\textsubscript{5/8}Ca\textsubscript{3/8}MnO\textsubscript{3} (RECMO, \textit{RE} $=$ rare-earth) manganite perovskites has been investigated through average structure synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction techniques. We demonstrate the intricate relationship between the \textit{B}O\textsubscript{6} octahedral rotation magnitude and lattice strain distortions acting in this series and how they tune macroscopic signatures describing ordering behavior. Through careful symmetry-motivated crystallographic analysis, we show that for the range of RECMO compositions which famously contain maxima in the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) response, their lattice strain states are in close proximity to that associated with a novel orbital order:charge disordered state we have recently unveiled in the quadruple manganite perovskites Na\textsubscript{1-\textit{x}}Ca\textsubscript{\textit{x}}Mn\textsubscript{7}O\textsubscript{12}. We establish that this order is the primary state which competes with the ferromagnetic metallic state which ultimately leads to phase coexistence and the emergence of CMR. Our results lend themselves to aiding a further understanding of how particular chemical complexities can control charge and orbital ordering phenomena, and also the general properties of manganite perovskites and other related systems \textit{via} strain effects.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Flat Chern Bands and Correlated States in Monolayer Re(Ag$X_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer Re(Ag$X_3$)$_2$ ($X=$ Cl, Br, I) have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Exact diagonalization suggests that $1/3$ filling of these Chern bands host correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave state. Interestingly, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class materials such as Re(Cu$X_3$)$_2$ and Re(Au$X_3$)$_2$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the research and application of topological quantum physics at elevated temperature.</description>

      <title>The effect of quenched heterogeneity on creep lifetimes of disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of describing creep in heterogeneous materials by an effective temperature by considering more realistic (and complex) non-mean-field elastic redistribution kernels. We show first, from theoretical considerations, that, if elastic stress redistribution and memory effects are neglected, the average creep failure time follows an Arrhenius expression with an effective temperature explicitly increasing with the quenched heterogeneity. Using a thermally activated progressive damage model of compressive failure, we show that this holds true when taking into account elastic interactions and memory effects, however with an effective temperature $T_{eff}$ depending as well on the nature of the (non-democratic) elastic interaction kernel. We observe that the variability of creep lifetimes, for given external conditions of load and temperature, is roughly proportional to the mean lifetime, therefore depends as well on $T$, on quenched heterogeneity, and the elastic kernel. Finally, we discuss the implications of this effective temperature effect on the interpretation of macroscopic creep tests to estimate an activation volume at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the natural resonances of time-varying dispersive interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time modulation of electromagnetic parameters offers novel exciting possibilities for advanced field manipulations. In this study, we explore wave scattering from a time-varying interface characterized by a Lorentz-type dispersion with a step-like temporal variation in its parameters. Our findings reveal a new process: an unconventional frequency generation at the natural resonances of the system. Remarkably, this phenomenon enables the coupling of propagating waves to evanescent ones, allowing the direct far-field excitation of surface-wave modes without the mediation of spatial gratings or prisms. These results suggest a novel strategy for designing compact and ultra-fast photonic devices, eliminating the necessity for subwavelength spatial structuring or prolonged temporal modulations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Dirac points in electron-energy spectra of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Specific properties, such as surface Fermi arcs, features of quantum oscillations and of various responses to a magnetic field, distinguish Dirac semimetals from ordinary materials. These properties are determined by Dirac points at which a contact of two electron-energy bands occurs and in the vicinity of which these bands disperse linearly in the quasimomentum. This work shows that almost the same properties are inherent in a wider class of materials in which the Dirac spectrum can have a noticeable gap comparable with the Fermi energy. In other words, the degeneracy of the bands at the point and their linear dispersion are not necessary for the existence of these properties. The only sufficient condition is the following: In the vicinity of such a quasi-Dirac point, the two close bands are well described by a two-band model that takes into account the strong spin-orbit interaction. To illustrate the results, the spectrum of ZrTe$_5$ is considered. This spectrum contains a special quasi-Dirac point, similar to that in bismuth.</description>

      <title>Improving Electrolyte Performance for Target Cathode Loading Using Interpretable Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher loading of active electrode materials is desired in batteries, especially those based on conversion reactions, for enhanced energy density and cost efficiency. However, increasing active material loading in electrodes can cause significant performance depreciation due to internal resistance, shuttling, and parasitic side reactions, which can be alleviated to a certain extent by a compatible design of electrolytes. In this work, a data-driven approach is leveraged to find a high-performing electrolyte formulation for a novel interhalogen battery custom to the target cathode loading. An electrolyte design consisting of 4 solvents and 4 salts is experimentally devised for a novel interhalogen battery based on a multi-electron redox reaction. The experimental dataset with variable electrolyte compositions and active cathode loading, is used to train a graph-based deep learning model mapping changing variables in the battery's material design to its specific capacity. The trained model is used to further optimize the electrolyte formulation compositions for enhancing the battery capacity at a target cathode loading by a two-fold approach: large-scale screening and interpreting electrolyte design principles for different cathode loadings. The data-driven approach is demonstrated to bring about an additional 20% increment in the specific capacity of the battery over capacities obtained from the experimental optimization.</description>

      <title>Probing Noncentrosymmetric 2D Materials by Fourier Space Second Harmonic Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The controlled assembly of twisted 2D structures requires precise determination of the crystal orientation of their component layers. In the established procedure, the second-harmonic generation (SHG) intensity of a noncentrosymmetric layer is recorded while rotating the polarization of both the incident laser field and detected SHG, which can be time-consuming and tedious. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal orientation of transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride can be directly determined by recording SHG images generated by tightly focused laser beams in Fourier space. Using an azimuthally polarized laser beam, the SHG image distinctly reflects the hexagonal structure of the crystal lattice, revealing its orientation quickly and accurately. This technique could significantly impact the field of twistronics, which studies the effects of the relative angle between the layers of a stacked 2D structure, as well as advances the nanofabrication of 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are key materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their entangled magnetic and ferroelectric properties. Spiral multiferroics possess ferroelectric polarization and are particularly promising for electric control of magnetism and magnetic control of ferroelectricity. In this work, we uncover long-period incommensurate states characterized by unique multiferroic kinks in corundum nickelate Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$, a member of a promising family of polar magnets. Utilizing a 2-orbital $S=1$ model, we derive formulas for Heisenberg and anisotropic magnetic exchanges and magnetically-induced polarization, enabling their calculations from first principles. We use these parameters in Monte Carlo and Landau theory-based calculations to reproduce experimentally observed magnetic structures and polarization dependence on the magnetic field. We predict magnetic phase transitions between flat spiral, conical spiral, canted antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states under increasing magnetic fields. Kinks in the spiral phases repel each other through a Yukawa-like potential arising from exchange of massive magnons. We also find that suitably directed electric fields can be used to stabilize the ferromagnetic and spiral states. The findings open a new pathway to predictive first-principles modelling of multiferroics and will inspire experiments and technological applications based on multiferroic kinks.</description>

      <title>CdTe and HgTe doped with V, Cr, and Mn -- prospects for the quantum anomalous Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first principle calculations we examine properties of (Cd,V)Te, (Cd,Cr)Te, (Hg,V)Te, and (Hg,Cr)Te relevant to the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), such as the position of V- and Cr- derived energy levels and the exchange interactions between magnetic ions. We consider CdTe and HgTe, containing 12.5% of cation-substitutional V or Cr ions in comparison to the well-known case of (Cd,Mn)Te and (Hg,Mn)Te, and examine their suitability for the fabrication of ferromagnetic barriers or ferromagnetic topological quantum wells, respectively. To account for the strong correlation of transition metal d electrons we employ hybrid functionals with different mixing parameters aHSE focusing on aHSE = 0.32, which better reproduces the experimental band gaps in HgTe, CdTe, Hg0.875Mn0.125Te, and Cd0.875Mn0.125Te. We find that Cr, like Mn, acts as an isoelectronic dopant but V can be an in-gap donor in CdTe and a resonant donor in HgTe, similar to the case of Fe in HgSe. From the magnetic point of view, Cr-doping results in a ferromagnetic phase within the general gradient approximation (GGA) but interactions become antiferromagnetic within hybrid functionals. However, (Hg,V)Te is a ferromagnet within both exchange-correlation functionals in a stark contrast to (Hg,Mn)Te for which robust antiferromagnetic coupling is found theoretically and experimentally. Furthermore, we establish that the Jahn-Teller effect is relevant only in the case of Cr-doping. Considering lower defect concentrations in HgTe-based quantum wells compared to (Bi,Sb)3Te2 layers, our results imply that HgTe quantum wells or (Cd,Hg)Te barriers containing either V or Cr show advantages over (Bi,Sb,Cr,V)3Te2-based QAHE systems but whether (i) ferromagnetic coupling will dominate in the Cr case and (ii) V will not introduce too many electrons to the quantum well is to be checked experimentally</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non-Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non-Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress has been hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of surface-selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non-Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements, surface-projected density functional theory calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy measurements, we demonstrate that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc connectivity and generates new isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs. In the presence of a magnetic field, the surface-selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk--non-Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non-topological surface Fermi arcs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non-Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non-Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. Furthermore, it provides important enlightenment for constructing topological photonic crystals with surface reconstruction and studying their topological properties.</description>

      <title>Scalable Crystal Structure Relaxation Using an Iteration-Free Deep Generative Model with Uncertainty Quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational molecular and materials science, determining equilibrium structures is the crucial first step for accurate subsequent property calculations. However, the recent discovery of millions of new crystals and complex twisted structures has challenged traditional computational methods, both ab initio and machine-learning-based, due to their computationally intensive iterative processes. To address these scalability issues, here we introduce DeepRelax, a deep generative model capable of performing geometric crystal structure relaxation rapidly and without iterations. DeepRelax learns the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed structures directly from their unrelaxed ones. The ability to perform structural relaxation at the millisecond level per structure, combined with the scalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for large-scale virtual screening. We demonstrate DeepRelax's reliability and robustness by applying it to five diverse databases, including oxides, Materials Project, two-dimensional materials, van der Waals crystals, and crystals with point defects. DeepRelax consistently shows high accuracy and efficiency, validated by density functional theory calculations. Finally, we enhance its trustworthiness by integrating uncertainty quantification. This work significantly accelerates computational workflows, offering a robust and trustworthy machine-learning method for material discovery and advancing the application of AI for science.

      <title>Significant Photoluminescence Improvements from Bulk Germanium-Based Thin Films with Ultra-low Threading Dislocation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study focused on the Ge thickness and TDD impacts on Ge's photoluminescence (PL). The PL peak intensity of a bulk Ge sample (TDD = 6000 cm-2, n-doping = 1e16 cm-3) experiences a remarkable 32-fold increase as the thickness is reduced from 535 to 2 microns. This surpasses the PL peak intensity of a best-performing epitaxial-Ge on Si (epi-Ge) (0.75 micron thick, biaxial tensile strain= 0.2 percent, n-doping = 7e18 cm-3) by a factor of 2.5. Furthermore, the PL peak intensity of a 405-micron thick zero-TDD bulk Ge sample (n-doping = 5e17 cm-3) is 9.7 times that of the 0.75-micron thick epi-Ge, rising to 12.1 times when thinned to 1 micron. The bulk Ge-based TDD reduction approach can work in conjunction with n-type doping and strain engineering to enhance Ge laser performance, and relax the requirement on the latter two approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are a potential field for the energy storage of the future but are restricted by insufficient rate capability and rapid capacity degradation. Magnesium-sodium hybrid ion batteries (MSHBs) are an effective way to address these problems. Here, we report a new type of MSHBs that use layered sodium vanadate ((Na, Mn)V8O20 5H2O, Mn-NVO) cathodes coupled with an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode in Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. During electrochemical cycling, Mg2+ and Na+ co-participate in the cathode reactions, and the introduction of Na+ promotes the structural stability of the Mn-NVO cathode, as cleared by several ex-situ characterizations. Consequently, the Mn-NVO cathode presents great specific capacity (249.9 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1) and cycling (1500 cycles at 1500 mA g-1) in the Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. Besides, full battery displays long lifespan with 10,000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The rate performance and cycling stability of MSHBs have been improved by an economical and scalable method, and the mechanism for these improvements was discussed.</description>

      <title>Ab initio tight-binding Models for Mono- and Bilayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride ($\it h$-BN) exhibits dominant $\pi$-bands near the Fermi level, similar to graphene. However, unlike graphene, where tight-binding (TB) models accurately reproduce band edges near the $K$ and $K^{\prime}$ points in the Brillouin zone, a wider bandgap in $\it h$-BN necessitates capturing the band edges at both the $K$ and $M$ points for precise bandgap calculations. We present effective TB models derived from $\it ab initio$ calculations using maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) centered on boron and nitrogen sites. These models consider hopping terms of up to four distant neighbors and achieve excellent agreement with $\it ab initio$ results near the $K$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, we compare the band structures from our simplified models with those obtained from $\it ab initio$ calculations and the full tight-binding model to assess their accuracy. To account for the effects of strains, we introduce fitting parametrizations that relate the hopping parameters of the effective TB model to the lattice constant and interlayer distance. Additionally, we utilize the two-center approximation to calculate the interlayer hopping energies based on the relative distances between sublattices to generalize the interlayer hopping parameters across different stacking configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by comparing the electronic structure of zero-twist and twisted $\it h$-BN systems with $\it ab initio$ calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advent of autonomous laboratories, coupled with algorithms for high-throughput screening and active learning, promises to accelerate materials discovery and innovation. As these autonomous systems grow in complexity, the demand for robust and efficient workflow management software becomes increasingly critical. In this paper, we introduce AlabOS, a general-purpose software framework for orchestrating experiments and managing resources, with an emphasis on automated laboratories for materials synthesis and characterization. AlabOS features a reconfigurable experiment workflow model and a resource reservation mechanism, enabling the simultaneous execution of varied workflows composed of modular tasks while eliminating conflicts between tasks. To showcase its capability, we demonstrate the implementation of AlabOS in a prototype autonomous materials laboratory, A-Lab, with around 3,500 samples synthesized over 1.5 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water. We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

Abstract: We report on an ultrafast terahertz free-carrier dynamic study of a photo-excited WTe2 thin film. In the photo-excited state, we observe a metastable electronic state featuring negative differential terahertz photoconductivity and reduced scattering rate. Detailed electrodynamics analysis and first-principal calculation attribute it to light-induced topological phase transition, reducing density of states near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the emergence of an unconventional temporal isosbestic point marks a dynamic universality, strongly suggesting a percolative interaction between the two topologically distinct phases.</description>

      <title>Description of molecular chirality and its analysis with high harmonic generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To clarify the microscopic origin of chirality-induced optical effect, we develop an analytical method that extracts the chiral part of the Hamiltonian of molecular electronic states. We demonstrate this method in a model chiral molecule consisting of two helically stacked $N$-sided regular polygons, and compare it with numerical calculation for chiral discrimination via high-harmonic generation (HHG) of the same molecule. The discrimination signal here is the Kuhn $g$ factor, the difference between the harmonic intensity from the bicircular laser field and that from its reflected laser field normalized by their average. The $g$ factor is a pseudoscalar quantity that reflects the chirality of the molecule. As a result, we find that the $g$ factor becomes large over a wide range of harmonic orders making HHG suitable for chiral discrimination. We further find that, to increase the difference of harmonic intensity from the above two fields, the unnormalized $g$ factor, the increase of capacity to generate the longitudinal dipole moment is more advantageous than maximizing the transverse-to-longitudinal conversion efficiency via the optimization of molecular chirality. We speculate this criteria may be extended to other optical and current-induced processes relevant to the chiral molecules and materials.</description>

      <title>PINNs-MPF: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Multi-Phase-Field Simulation of Interface Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.</description>

      <title>Skin Effect of Nonlinear Optical Responses in Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics plays important roles in the research of fundamental physics and the applications of high-performance optoelectronic devices. The bulk nonlinear optical responses arise from the uniform light absorption in noncentrosymmetric crystals, and hence are usually considered to be the collective phenomena of all atoms. Here we show, in contrast to this common expectation, the nonlinear optical responses in antiferromagnets can be selectively accumulated near the surfaces, representing a skin effect. This is because the inversion symmetry, despite being broken globally by magnetism, is barely violated locally deeply inside these antiferromagnets. Using A-type layered antiferromagnets as the representatives, we predict that the spatial-dependent nonlinear optical responses, such as bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are notable in the top- and bottom-most layers and decay rapidly when moving away from the surfaces. Such a phenomenon is strongly associated with the antiferromagnetism and exists in a broad range of antiferromagnets composed of centrosymmetric sublattices, offering promising device applications using these antiferromagnets. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked property of nonlinear optical responses and opens new opportunities for high-performance antiferromagnetic optospintronics.</description>

Abstract: The exceptional electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries has spurred considerable interest in advanced battery technologies, particularly those utilizing ternary nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) cathode materials, which are renowned for their robust electrochemical performance and structural stability. Building upon this research, investigators have explored doping additional elements into NCM cathode materials to further enhance their electrochemical performance and structural integrity. However, the multitude of doping strategies available for NCM battery systems presents a challenge in determining the most effective approach. In this study, we elucidate the potential of ternary NCM systems as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. We compile a comprehensive database of lithium-ion batteries employing NCM systems from various sources of prior research and develop a corresponding data-driven model utilizing graph neural networks to predict optimal doping strategies. Our aim is to provide insights into the NCM-based battery systems for both fundamental understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as ``supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Optoelectronic Processes in Colloidal 2D Multi-Layered MAPbBr3 Perovskite Nanosheets: Funneling, Recombination and Self-Trapped Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n &gt; 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for characterizing uncertain elastic properties of fused filament fabricated materials for topology optimization applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The layering approach used in fused filament fabrication (FFF) enables creation of complex designs generated by topology optimization. Defects associated with the layer-by-layer process, introduce considerable random variability to the local elastic modulus of the print. The elastic modulus along the fusion layers connecting bulk materials differs from that of the bulk areas. Accurate quantitative measurements of variations in both areas are essential to achieve robust optimized designs. This study aims to quantify the parameters of the random distributions given the surface strain field of the print measured by digital image correlation (DIC). Two statistical properties, mean and standard deviation, are sufficient to characterize the stochastic elastic modulus fields in each region. An efficient neural network model is developed to estimate spatial variations in the local elastic modulus within both bulk and fusion layers. This model is trained on a dataset of synthetic strain fields with known distributions in the elastic modulus fields. It performs well in correlating the elastic modulus with the input strain, as long as the standard deviation is below 60% of the mean of the random field. The predictive accuracy of the model on testing data, measured by the R2 score, is 0.99 and 0.95 for mean and standard deviation in the fusion material. The scores for the bulk material are 0.97 each. The trained model is implemented to predict the elastic modulus distribution of an FFF-printed material at a print speed of 30 mm/s and an extrusion temperature of 493.15 K, based on its DIC-measured surface strain data. The model predicts a mean and standard deviation of 1.2 GPa and 1 GPa for the bulk material and 400 MPa and 430 MPa for the fusion region. Validation of predictions confirms the reliability of this approach in measuring uncertainty in the local properties of the prints.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Magnonics with Localized Spoof Surface Plasmon Polaritons</title>

Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as a promising direction for information propagation with preserved coherence. Due to high tunability of magnons, their interactions with microwave photons can be engineered to probe novel phenomena based on strong photon-magnon coupling. Improving the photon-magnon coupling strength can be done by tuning the structure of microwave resonators to better interact with the magnon counterpart. Planar resonators have been explored due to their potential for on-chip integration, but only common modes from stripline-based resonators have been used. Here, we present a microwave spiral resonator supporting the spoof localized surface plasmons (LSPs) and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We showcase strong magnon-LSP photon coupling using a ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet sphere. We discuss the dependence of the spiral resonator design to the engineering capacity of the photon mode frequency and spatial field distributions, via both experiment and simulation. By the localized photon mode profiles, the resulting magnetic field concentrates near the surface dielectrics, giving rise to an enhanced magnetic filling factor. The strong coupling and large engineering space render the spoof LSPs an interesting contender in developing novel hybrid magnonic systems and functionalities.</description>

      <title>Topological Charge Quadrupole Protected by Spin-Orbit U(1) Quasi-Symmetry in Antiferromagnet NdBiPt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in crystal solids has given rise to various elementary excitations as quasiparticles. Among these, those with significant Berry-phase-related transport responses are of particular interest. Here, we predict a new type of quasiparticle called topological charge quadruple (TCQ), which is analogous to a charge quadrupole but consists of two closely-packed pairs of Weyl points in momentum space, specifically in a half-Heusler antiferromagnet NdBiPt. Interestingly, the TCQ is protected by the spin-orbit $U(1)$ quasi-symmetry, rather than any exact crystallographic symmetries. This quasi-symmetry restricts the energy splitting induced by symmetry-lowering perturbations to a second-order effect. Furthermore, the closely located Berry curvature sources and sinks in the TCQ lead to a large Berry curvature dipole, resulting in a significant nonlinear Hall effect. Our work opens an avenue for designing novel quasiparticles using quasi-symmetries and developing materials with enhanced nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Auto-resolving atomic structure at van der Waal interfaces using a generative model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unveiling atomic structures is significant for the relationship construction between microscopic configurations and macroscopic properties of materials. However, we still lack a rapid, accurate, and robust approach to automatically resolve complex patterns in atomic-resolution microscopy. Here, we present a Trident strategy-enhanced disentangled representation learning method (a generative model), which utilizes a few unlabeled experimental images with abundant low-cost simulated images to generate a large corpus of annotated simulation data that closely resembles experimental conditions, realizing simultaneous achievement of high quality and large volumes of the training dataset. A structural inference model is then trained via a residual neural network which can directly deduce the interlayer slip and rotation of diversified and complicated stacking patterns at van der Waals (vdWs) interfaces with picometer-scale accuracy across various materials (ReS2, ReSe2, and MoS2) with different layer numbers (bilayer and trilayers) and demonstrates robustness to defects, imaging quality, and surface contaminations. The framework can also identify pattern transition interfaces, quantify subtle motif variations, and discriminate moir\'e patterns that are undistinguishable in frequency domains. The high-throughput processing ability of our method helps discover a novel vdW epitaxy where various thermodynamically favorable slip stackings can coexist, demonstrating the machine learning contribution to the new knowledge emergence.</description>

      <title>Mixed-valence state in the dilute-impurity regime of La-substituted SmB$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous mixed-valence (MV) behaviour is one of the most intriguing phenomena of $f$-electron systems. Despite extensive efforts, a fundamental aspect which remains unsettled is the determination of the limiting cases for which MV emerges. Here we address this question for SmB$_6$, a prototypical MV system characterized by two nearly-degenerate Sm$^{2+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ configurations. By combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we track the evolution of the mean Sm valence, $v_{Sm}$, in the Sm$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ series. Upon substitution of Sm ions with trivalent La, we observe a linear decrease of valence fluctuations to an almost complete suppression at $x$$\,$=$\,$0.2, with $v_{Sm}$$\,$$\sim$$\,$2; surprisingly, by further reducing $x$, a re-entrant increase of $v_{Sm}$ develops, approaching the value of $v_{imp}$$\,$$\sim$$\,$2.35 in the dilute-impurity limit. Such observation departs from a monotonic evolution of $v_{Sm}$ across the whole series, as well as from the expectation of its convergence to an integer value for $x$$\,$$\rightarrow$$\,$0. Our ARPES and XAS results, complemented by a phenomenological model, demonstrate an unconventional evolution of the MV character in the Sm$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ series, paving the way to further theoretical and experimental considerations on the concept of MV itself, and its influence on the macroscopic properties of rare-earth compounds in the dilute-to-intermediate impurity regime.</description>

      <title>Stripe magnetic order and field-induced quantum criticality in the perfect triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CsCeSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) is a textbook example of frustrated magnetic systems. Despite its simplicity, the TLAF model exhibits a highly rich and complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring numerous distinct ground states that can be stabilized through frustrated next-nearest-neighbor couplings or anisotropy. In this paper, we report low-temperature magnetic properties of the TLAF material CsCeSe$_2$. The inelastic neutron scattering (INS) together with specific heat measurements and density functional theory calculations of crystalline electric field suggest that the ground state of Ce ions is a Kramers doublet with strong easy-plane anisotropy. Elastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrate the presence of stripe-$yz$ magnetic order that develops below $T_{\rm N} = 0.35$ K, with the zero-field ordered moment of $m_{\rm Ce} \approx 0.65~\mu_{\rm B}$. Application of magnetic field first increases the ordering temperature by about 20% at the intermediate field region and eventually suppresses the stripe order in favor of the field-polarized ferromagnetic state via a continuous quantum phase transition (QPT). The field-induced response demonstrates sizable anisotropy for different in-plane directions, $\mathbf{B}\parallel{}\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{B}\perp{}\mathbf{a}$, which indicates the presence of bond-dependent coupling in the spin Hamiltonian. We further show theoretically that the presence of anisotropic bond-dependent interactions can change the universality class of QPT for $\mathbf{B}\parallel{}\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{B}\perp{}\mathbf{a}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Dynamics Due to Strong Kitaev Interactions in the Triangular-Lattice Antiferromagnet CsCeSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraordinary properties of the Kitaev model have motivated an intense search for new physics in materials that combine geometrical and bond frustration. In this work, we employ inelastic neutron scattering, spin wave theory, and exact diagonalization to study the spin dynamics in the perfect triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) CsCeSe$_2$. This material orders into a stripe phase, which is demonstrated to arise as a consequence of the off-diagonal bond-dependent terms in the spin Hamiltonian. By studying the spin dynamics at intermediate fields, we identify an interaction between the single-magnon state and the two-magnon continuum that causes decay of coherent magnon excitations, level repulsion, and transfer of spectral weight to the continuum that are controlled by the strength of the magnetic field. Our results provide a microscopic mechanism for the stabilization of the stripe phase in TLAF and show how complex many-body physics can be present in the spin dynamics in a magnet with strong Kitaev coupling even in an ordered ground state.</description>

      <title>Optical properties and electronic correlations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ bilayer nickelates under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the optical properties of La3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates by using density functional theory including a Coulomb repulsion term. Convincing agreement with recent experimental ambient-pressure spectra is achieved for U=3eV, which permits tracing the microscopic origin of the characteristic features. Simultaneous consistency with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction suggests the notion of rather moderate electronic correlations in this novel high-Tc superconductor. Oxygen vacancies form predominantly at the inner apical sites and renormalize the optical spectrum quantitatively, while the released electrons are largely accommodated by a defect state. We show that the structural transition occurring under high pressure coincides with a significant enhancement of the Drude weight and a reduction of the out-of-plane interband contribution that act as a fingerprint of the emerging hole pocket. We further calculate the optical spectra for various possible magnetic phases including spin-density waves and discuss the results in the context of experiment. Finally, we investigate the role of the 2-2 versus 1-3 layer stacking and compare the bilayer nickelate to La4Ni3O10, La3Ni2O6, and NdNiO2, unveiling general trends in the optical spectrum as a function of the formal Ni valence in Ruddlesden-Popper versus reduced Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Breaking surface plasmon excitation constraint via surface spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems have attracted great attention for their promising light-matter applications. However, the excitation of a surface plasmon, in particular, transverse-electric (TE) surface plasmon, remains an outstanding challenge due to the difficulty to conserve energy and momentum simultaneously in the normal 2D materials. Here we show that the TE surface plasmons ranging from gigahertz to terahertz regime can be effectively excited and manipulated in a hybrid dielectric, 2D material and magnet structure. The essential physics is that the surface spin wave supplements an additional freedom of surface plasmon excitation and thus greatly enhances the electric field in the 2D medium. Based on widely-used magnetic materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and manganese difluoride ($\mathrm{MnF}_2$), we further show that the plasmon excitation manifests itself as a measurable dip in the reflection spectrum of the hybrid system while the dip position and the dip depth can be well controlled by an electric gating on the 2D layer and an external magnetic field. Our findings should bridge the fields of low-dimensional physics, plasmonics and spintronics and open a novel route to integrate plasmonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the static dielectric screening approximation of Coulomb interactions in atomically thin semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions in atomically thin materials are uniquely sensitive to variations in the dielectric screening of the environment, which can be used to control quasiparticles and exotic quantum many-body phases. A static approximation of the dielectric response, where increased dielectric screening is predicted to cause an energy redshift of the exciton resonance, has been until now sufficient. Here, we use charge-tunable exciton resonances to study screening effects in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers embedded in materials with dielectric constants ranging from 4 to more than 1000. In contrast to expectations, we observe a blueshift of the exciton resonance exceeding 30 meV for larger dielectric constant environments. By employing a dynamical screening model, we find that while the exciton binding energy remains mostly controlled by the static dielectric response, the exciton self-energy is dominated by the high-frequency response. Dielectrics with markedly different static and high-frequency screening enable the selective addressing of distinct many-body effects in layered materials and their heterostructures, expanding the tunability range and offering new routes to detect and control correlated quantum many-body states and to design optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Crystal, ferromagnetism, and magnetoresistance with sign reversal in a EuAgP semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We synthesized the ferromagnetic EuAgP semiconductor and conducted a comprehensive study of its crystalline, magnetic, heat capacity, band gap, and magnetoresistance properties. Our investigation utilized a combination of X-ray diffraction, optical, and PPMS DynaCool measurements. EuAgP adopts a hexagonal structure with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group. As the temperature decreases, it undergoes a magnetic phase transition from high-temperature paramagnetism to low-temperature ferromagnetism. We determined the ferromagnetic transition temperature to be $T_{\textrm{C}} =$ 16.45(1) K by fitting the measured magnetic susceptibility using a Curie-Weiss law. Heat capacity analysis of EuAgP considered contributions from electrons, phonons, and magnons, revealing $\eta$ = 0.03 J/mol/$\textrm{K}^\textrm{2}$, indicative of semiconducting behavior. Additionally, we calculated a band gap of $\sim$ 1.324(4) eV based on absorption spectrum measurements. The resistivity versus temperature of EuAgP measured in the absence of an applied magnetic field shows a pronounced peak around $T_{\textrm{C}}$, which diminishes rapidly with increasing applied magnetic fields, ranging from 1 to 14 T. An intriguing phenomenon emerges in the form of a distinct magnetoresistance transition, shifting from positive (e.g., 1.95\% at 300 K and 14 T) to negative (e.g., -30.73\% at 14.25 K and 14 T) as the temperature decreases. This behavior could be attributed to spin-disordered scattering.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recently discovered kagome superconductor AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs), the superconductivity is intertwined with an unconventional charge density wave order. Its pairing symmetry remains elusive owing to the lack of direct measurement of the superconducting gap in the momentum space. In this letter, utilizing laser-based ultra-high-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe anisotropic Cooper pairing in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We detect a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure with an anisotropy over 80% and the gap maximum along the V-V bond direction on a Fermi surface originated from the 3d-orbital electrons of the V kagome lattice. It is in stark contrast to the isotropic superconducting gap structure on the other Fermi surface that is occupied by Sb 5p-orbital electrons. Our observation of the anisotropic Cooper pairing in pristine CsV3Sb5 is fundamental for understanding intertwined orders in the ground state of kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Path-based packing of icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>
