      <title>Semi-Supervised Treatment Effect Estimation with Unlabeled Covariates via Generalized Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates treatment effect estimation in the semi-supervised setting, where we can use not only the standard triple of covariates, treatment indicator, and outcome, but also unlabeled auxiliary covariates. For this problem, we develop efficiency bounds and efficient estimators whose asymptotic variance aligns with the efficiency bound. In the analysis, we introduce two different data-generating processes: the one-sample setting and the two-sample setting. The one-sample setting considers the case where we can observe treatment indicators and outcomes for a part of the dataset, which is also called the censoring setting. In contrast, the two-sample setting considers two independent datasets with labeled and unlabeled data, which is also called the case-control setting or the stratified setting. In both settings, we find that by incorporating auxiliary covariates, we can lower the efficiency bound and obtain an estimator with an asymptotic variance smaller than that without such auxiliary covariates.</description>

      <title>Debiased Inference for Dynamic Nonlinear Panels with Multi-dimensional Heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03134v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generic class of dynamic nonlinear heterogeneous parameter models that incorporate individual and time fixed effects in both the intercept and slope. These models are subject to the incidental parameter problem, in that the limiting distribution of the point estimator is not centered at zero, and that test statistics do not follow their standard asymptotic distributions as in the absence of the fixed effects. To address the problem, we develop an analytical bias correction procedure to construct a bias-corrected likelihood. The resulting estimator follows an asymptotic normal distribution with mean zero. Moreover, likelihood-based test statistics -- including likelihood-ratio, Lagrange-multiplier, and Wald tests -- follow the limiting chi-squared distribution under the null hypothesis. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed correction method, and an empirical application on the labor force participation of single mothers underscores its practical importance.</description>

      <title>Jackknife inference with two-way clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For linear regression models with cross-section or panel data, it is natural to assume that the disturbances are clustered in two dimensions. However, the finite-sample properties of two-way cluster-robust tests and confidence intervals are often poor. We discuss several ways to improve inference with two-way clustering. Two of these are existing methods for avoiding, or at least ameliorating, the problem of undefined standard errors when a cluster-robust variance matrix estimator (CRVE) is not positive definite. One is a new method that always avoids the problem. More importantly, we propose a family of new two-way CRVEs based on the cluster jackknife and prove that they yield valid inferences asymptotically. Simulations for models with two-way fixed effects suggest that, in many cases, the cluster-jackknife CRVE combined with our new method yields surprisingly accurate inferences. We provide a simple software package, twowayjack for Stata, that implements our recommended variance estimator.</description>

      <title>A data-driven merit order: Learning a fundamental electricity price model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electricity price forecasting approaches generally fall into two categories: data-driven models, which learn from historical patterns, or fundamental models, which simulate market mechanisms. We propose a novel and highly efficient data-driven merit order model that integrates both paradigms.The model embeds the classical expert-based merit order as a nested special case, allowing all key parameters, such as plant efficiencies, bidding behavior, and available capacities, to be estimated directly from historical data, rather than assumed.We further enhance the model with critical embedded extensions such as hydro power, cross-border flows and corrections for underreported capacities, which considerably improve forecasting accuracy.Applied to the German day-ahead market, our model outperforms both classic fundamental and state-of-the-art machine learning models. It retains the interpretability of fundamental models, offering insights into marginal technologies, fuel switches, and dispatch patterns, elements which are typically inaccessible to black-box machine learning approaches.This transparency and high computational efficiency make it a promising new direction for electricity price modeling.</description>
