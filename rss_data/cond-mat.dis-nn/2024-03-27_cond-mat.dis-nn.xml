      <title>Random Apollonian networks with tailored clustering coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of complex networks that interpolates between the Apollonian network and its binary version, recently introduced in [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{107}, 024305 (2023)], via random removal of nodes. The dilution process allows the clustering coefficient to vary from $C=0.828$ to $C=0$ while maintaining the behavior of average path length and other relevant quantities as in the deterministic Apollonian network. Robustness against the random deletion of nodes is also reported on spectral quantities such as the ground-state localization degree and its energy gap to the first excited state. The loss of the $2\pi / 3$ rotation symmetry as a tree-like network emerges is investigated in the light of the hub wavefunction amplitude. Our findings expose the interplay between the small-world property and other distinctive traits exhibited by Apollonian networks, as well as their resilience against random attacks.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Quantum Chaos and Anomalous Relaxation in Open Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space dimension.</description>
