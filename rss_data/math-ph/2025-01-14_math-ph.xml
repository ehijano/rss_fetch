      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory I: the Hopf category of higher-graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2-Chern-Simons theory, or more commonly known as 4d BF-BB theory with gauged shift symmetry, is a natural generalization of Chern-Simons theory to 4-dimensional manifolds. It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is the 2-truncation $\Gamma^2$ of the $\infty$-groupoid of simplices formed by the underlying lattice $\Gamma$. On such a "2-graph", we model states of 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's \textit{measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows the 2-graph states -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matriex gives it a comonoidal {\it cobraiding} structure. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group lattice 2-gauge theories. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $\Gamma$, and extract the observables of discrete 2-Chern-Simons theory from it.</description>

      <title>Mean-field behavior of the quantum Ising susceptibility and a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse-field Ising model is widely studied as one of the simplest quantum spin systems. It is known that this model exhibits a phase transition at the critical inverse temperature $\beta_{\mathrm{c}}(q)$, where $q$ is the strength of the transverse field. Bj\"ornberg [Commun. Math. Phys., 232 (2013)] investigated the divergence rate of the susceptibility for the nearest-neighbor model as the critical point is approached by simultaneously changing $q$ and the spin-spin coupling $J$ in a proper manner, with fixed temperature. In this paper, we prove that the susceptibility diverges as $(\beta_{\mathrm{c}}(q)-\beta)^{-1}$ as $\beta\uparrow\beta_{\mathrm{c}}(q)$ for $d&gt;4$ assuming an infrared bound on the space-time two-point function. One of the key elements is a stochastic-geometric representation in Bj\"ornberg &amp; Grimmett [J. Stat. Phys., 136 (2009)] and Crawford &amp; Ioffe [Commun. Math. Phys., 296 (2010)]. As a byproduct, we derive a new lace expansion for the classical Ising model (i.e., $q=0$).</description>

      <title>PT-Symmetric $SU(2)$-like Random Matrix Ensembles: Invariant Distributions and Spectral Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an ensemble of $2\times 2$ normal matrices with complex entries representing operators in the quantum mechanics of 2 - level parity-time reversal (PT) symmetric systems. The randomness of the ensemble is endowed by obtaining probability distributions based on symmetry and statistical independence. The probability densities turn out to be power law with exponents that depend on the boundedness of the domain. For small spacings, $\sigma$, the probability density varies as $\sigma^{\nu}$, $\nu \geq 2$. The degree of level repulsion is a parameter of great interest as it makes a connection to quantum chaos; the lower bound of $\nu$ for our ensemble coincides with the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. We believe that the systematic development presented here paves the way for further generalizations in the field of random matrix theory for PT-symmetric quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dualities in random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality identities in random matrix theory for products and powers of characteristic polynomials, and for moments, are reviewed. The structure of a typical duality identity for the average of a positive integer power $k$ of the characteristic polynomial for particular ensemble of $N \times N$ matrices is that it is expressed as the average of the power $N$ of the characteristic polynomial of some other ensemble of random matrices, now of size $k \times k$. With only a few exceptions, such dualities involve (the $\beta$ generalised) classical Gaussian, Laguerre and Jacobi ensembles Hermitian ensembles, the circular Jacobi ensemble, or the various non-Hermitian ensembles relating to Ginibre random matrices. In the case of unitary symmetry in the Hermitian case, they can be studied using the determinantal structure. The $\beta$ generalised case requires the use of Jack polynomial theory, and in particular Jack polynomial based hypergeometric functions. Applications to the computation of the scaling limit of various $\beta$ ensemble correlation and distribution functions are also reviewed. The non-Hermitian case relies on the particular cases of Jack polynomials corresponding to zonal polynomials, and their integration properties when their arguments are eigenvalues of certain matrices. The main tool to study dualities for moments of the spectral density, and generalisations, is the loop equations.</description>

      <title>Segal-Bargmann transforms and generalized Weyl algebras associated with the~Meixner class of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meixner~(1934) proved that there exist exactly five classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences: Hermite polynomials which are orthogonal with respect to Gaussian distribution, Charlier polynomials orthogonal with respect to Poisson distribution, Laguerre polynomials orthogonal with respect to gamma distribution, Meixner polynomials of the first kind, orthogonal with respect to negative binomial distribution, and Meixner polynomials of the second kind, orthogonal with respect to Meixner distribution. The Segal--Bargmann transform provides a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the Gaussian distribution and the Fock or Segal--Bargmann space of entire funcitons. This construction was also extended to the case of the Poisson distribution. The present paper deals with the latter three classes of orthogonal Sheffer sequences. By using a set of nonlinear coherent states, we construct a generalized Segal--Bargmann transform which is a unitary isomorphism between the $L^2$-space of the orthogonality measure and a certain Fock space of entire functions. In a special case, such a Fock space was already studied by Alpay--J\o rgensen--Seager--Volok~(2013) and Alpay--Porat~(2018). To derive our results, we use normal ordering in generalized Weyl algebras that are naturally associated with the orthogonal Sheffer sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional Coulomb gases on the Riemann sphere with determinantal or Pfaffian structures, under external potentials that are invariant under rotations around the axis connecting the north and south poles, and with microscopic point charges inserted at the poles. These models can be interpreted as Coulomb gases on the complex plane with weakly confining potentials, where the associated droplet is the entire complex plane. For these models, we derive precise asymptotic expansions of the free energies, including the constant terms.</description>

      <title>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</description>

      <title>Instantons with continuous conformal symmetries: Hyperbolic and singular monopoles and more, oh my!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout this paper, we comprehensively study instantons with every kind of continuous conformal symmetry. Examples of these objects are hard to come by due to non-linear constraints. However, by applying previous work on moduli spaces, we introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies these non-linear constraints. This simplification not only allows us to easily find a plethora of novel instantons with various continuous conformal symmetries and higher rank structure groups, it also provides a framework for classifying such symmetric objects. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the connections between instantons with continuous symmetries and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and singular monopoles as well as hyperbolic analogues to Higgs bundles and Nahm data.</description>

      <title>On the solution of the harmonic-divgrad PDEs system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a particular system of partial differential equations in which the harmonic, the divergence and the gradient operators of the unknown functions appear (harmonic-divgrad system). Using the Killing Hopf theorem and leveraging the properties of Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature we establish the conditions under which these equations admit only the trivial solutions proving their trivialization on positive curvature space forms. The analysis of this particular system is motivated by its occurrence in the study of asymptotic symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories and in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Strong Low Degree Hardness for Stable Local Optima in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief in the theory of spin glasses and disordered systems that out-of-equilibrium dynamics fail to find stable local optima exhibiting e.g. local strict convexity on physical time-scales. In the context of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass, Behrens-Arpino-Kivva-Zdeborov\'a and Minzer-Sah-Sawhney have recently conjectured that this obstruction may be inherent to all efficient algorithms, despite the existence of exponentially many such optima throughout the landscape. We prove this search problem exhibits strong low degree hardness for polynomial algorithms of degree $D\leq o(N)$: any such algorithm has probability $o(1)$ to output a stable local optimum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to prove that even constant-degree polynomials have probability $o(1)$ to solve a random search problem without planted structure. To prove this, we develop a general-purpose enhancement of the ensemble overlap gap property, and as a byproduct improve previous results on spin glass optimization, maximum independent set, random $k$-SAT, and the Ising perceptron to strong low degree hardness. Finally for spherical spin glasses with no external field, we prove that Langevin dynamics does not find stable local optima within dimension-free time.</description>

      <title>Fermion as a non-local particle-hole excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the fermion, in the context of a system that comprises many such entities - which, by virtue of the Pauli exclusion principle, possesses a Fermi surface at zero temperature - may itself be thought of as a collection of non-local particle-hole excitations across this Fermi surface. This result is purely kinematical and completely general - not being restricted to any specific dimension, applicable to both continuum and lattice systems. There is also no implication that it is applicable only to low-energy phenomena close to the Fermi surface. We are able to derive the full single-particle dynamical Green function of this fermion at finite temperature by viewing it as a collection of these non-local particle-hole excitations. The Green function of the fermion then manifests itself as a solution to a first-order differential equation in a parameter that controls the number of particle-hole pairs across the Fermi surface, and this equation itself reveals variable coefficients that may be identified with a Bose-Einstein distribution - implying that there is a sense in which the non-local particle-hole excitations have bosonic qualities while not being exact bosons at the level of operators. We also recall the definition of the non-local particle-hole operator that may be used to diagonalize the kinetic energy of free fermions of the sort mentioned above. Number-conserving products of creation and annihilation operators of fermions are expressible as a (rather complicated) combination of these non-local particle-hole operators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present an exact solution for the convex roof of the square root threetangle for all states within the Bloch sphere. The working hypothesis is that optimal decompositions contain as many states from the zero-polytope as possible which can be called zero-state locking. The footprint of the measure of entanglement consists in a characteristic pattern for the fixed pure states on the surface which form the optimal solution. The solution is subject to transformation properties due to the SL-invariance of the entanglement measure.</description>

      <title>Exact density profile in a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the many-body dynamics of a tight-binding chain with dephasing noise on the infinite interval. We obtain the exact solution of an average particle-density profile for the domain wall and the alternating initial conditions via the Bethe ansatz, analytically deriving the asymptotic expressions for the long time dynamics. For the domain wall initial condition, we obtain the scaling form of the average density, elucidating that the diffusive transport always emerges in the long time dynamics if the strength of the dephasing, no matter how small, is positive. For the alternating initial condition, our exact solution leads to the fact that the average density displays oscillatory decay or over-damped decay depending on the strength of the dissipation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the asymptotic forms approach those of the symmetric simple exclusion process, identifying corrections from it.</description>

      <title>Mass (re)distribution for quantum dust cores of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective ground state for a spherical symmetric dust ball has been investigated recently in [R. Casadio, Phys. Lett. B 843 (2023) 138055]. In this study, we refine that model by obtaining a mass distribution that accounts for the superposition of wavefunctions across different layers. The refined mass distribution shows significant deviations from the approximation without quantum superpositions. Specifically, the new nearly parabolic distribution replaces the linear mass profile of the original work, featuring an overall downward concavity, which leads to a non-vanishing tension. Notably, the regularity of the metric and causal structure are preserved in the refined analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative refractive index materials have garnered widespread attention due to their anomalous electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we utilize complementing boundary conditions to conduct a priori estimates for Cauchy problems and derive the limiting absorption principle. Consequently, we establish the well-posedness of the transmission problem involving conventional materials and negative refractive index materials within a simulated two-dimensional periodic structure.</description>

Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a countable discrete amenable group, we investigate the conditions under which a set map into a Banach space (or more generally, a complete semi-normed space) can be realized as the ergodic sum of a vector under a group representation, such that the realization is asymptotically indistinguishable from the original map. We show that for uniformly bounded group representations, this property is characterized by the class of bounded asymptotically additive set maps, extending previous work for sequences in Banach spaces and single contractions. Additionally, we develop a relative version of this characterization, identifying conditions under which the additive realization can be chosen within a specified target set. As an application, our results generalize key aspects of thermodynamic formalism, bridging the gap between additive and non-additive frameworks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie (super)algebras as novel possible generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix. As the results, we demonstrate that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded extension of the supersymmetric algebra can be a symmetry of $S$-matrix. Furthermore, it turns out that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie algebra appears as internal symmetries. They are natural extensions of Coleman-Mandula theorem and Haag-Lopszanski-Sohnius theorem, which are the no-go theorems for generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for graviton, "partially massless" graviton, and photon fields in de Sitter spacetime under conformal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime, that unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton, and photon fields. This framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense and employs Dirac's six-cone formalism. Originally introduced by Dirac, the concept of conformal space and the six-cone formalism were used to derive the field equations for spinor and vector fields in $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form. Our framework extends this approach to dS spacetime, unifying the treatment of massless and ``partially massless'' fields with integer spin $s&gt;0$ under conformal symmetry. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt boundary deformation techniques to solve a Neumann problem for the Helmholtz equation with rough electric potentials in bounded domains. In particular, we study the dependance of Neumann eigenvalues of the perturbed Laplacian with respect to boundary deformation, and we illustrate how to find a domain in which the Neumann problem can be solved for any energy, if there is some freedom in the choice of the domain. This work is motivated by a Runge approximation result in the context of an inverse problem in point-source scattering with partial data.</description>

      <title>On characteristic classes of vector bundles over quantum spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantization of spaces whose K-theory in the classical limit is the ring of dual numbers $\mathbb{Z}[t]/(t^2)$. For a compact Hausdorff space we recall necessary and sufficient conditions for this to hold. For a compact quantum space, we give sufficient conditions that guarantee there is a morphism of abelian groups $K_0 \to \mathbb{Z}[t]/(t^2)$ compatible with the tensor product of bimodules. Applications include the standard Podle\'s sphere $S^2_q$ and a quantum $4$-sphere $S^4_q$ coming from quantum symplectic groups. For the latter, the K-theory is generated by the Euler class of the instanton bundle. We give explicit formulas for the projections of vector bundles on $S^4_q$ associated to the principal $SU_q(2)$-bundle $S^7_q \to S^4_q$ via irreducible corepresentations of $SU_q(2)$, and compute their characteristic classes.</description>

      <title>On the Time-decay of solutions arising from periodically forced Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increased interest in time-dependent (non-autonomous) Hamiltonians, stemming in part from the active field of Floquet quantum materials. Despite this, dispersive time-decay bounds, which reflect energy transport in such systems, have received little attention.
  We study the dynamics of non-autonomous, time-periodically forced, Dirac Hamiltonians: $i\partial_t\alpha =D(t)\alpha$, where $D(t)=i\sigma_3\partial_x+ \nu(t)$ is time-periodic but not spatially localized. For the special case $\nu(t)=m\sigma_1$, which models a relativistic particle of constant mass $m$, one has a dispersive decay bound: $\|\alpha(t,x)\|_{L^\infty_x}\lesssim t^{-\frac12}$. Previous analyses of Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians suggest that this decay bound persists for small, spatially-localized and time-periodic $\nu(t)$. However, we show that this is not necessarily the case if $\nu(t)$ is not spatially localized. Specifically, we study two non-autonomous Dirac models whose time-evolution (and monodromy operator) is constructed via Fourier analysis. In a rotating mass model, the dispersive decay bound is of the same type as for the constant mass model. However, in a model with a periodically alternating sign of the mass, the results are quite different. By stationary-phase analysis of the associated Fourier representation, we display initial data for which the $L^\infty_x$ time-decay rate are considerably slower: $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/3})$ or even $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/5})$ as $t\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential and variable number of particles control the quantum state: Quantum oscillators as a showcase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their simplicity, quantum harmonic oscillators are ubiquitous in the modeling of physical systems. They are able to capture universal properties that serve as reference for the more complex systems found in nature. In this spirit, we apply a model of a Hamiltonian for open quantum systems in equilibrium with a particle reservoir to ensembles of quantum oscillators. By treating (i) a dilute gas of vibrating particles and (ii) a chain of coupled oscillators as showcases, we demonstrate that the property of varying number of particles leads to a mandatory condition on the energy of the system. In particular, the chemical potential plays the role of a parameter of control that can externally manipulate the spectrum of a system and the corresponding accessible quantum states.</description>

Abstract: We study an SL(2, Z) symmetry of a variant of BCOV theory in three complex dimensions. Using conjectural descriptions of twists of superstrings in terms of topological strings, we argue that this action can be thought of as a version of S-duality that preserves an SU(3)-invariant twist of type IIB supergravity. We analyze how SL(2,Z) acts on various deformations of the holomorphic-topological twist of 4-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory, which come from residual supertranslations and superconformal symmetries, and are of relevance to geometric Langlands theory and gauge-theoretic constructions of the Yangian.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a natural mathematical definition of boundary states of a bulk gapped ground state, in the operator algebraic framework of $2$-d quantum spin systems. With approximate Haag duality at the boundary, we derive a $C^*$-tensor category $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ out of such boundary state. Under a non-triviality condition of the braiding in the bulk, we show that the Drinfeld center (with an asymptotic constraint) of $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$ is equivalent to the bulk braided $C^*$-tensor category derived in [14].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present new solutions of the non-linear Schr\"oodinger equation proposed by Nobre, Rego-Monteiro and Tsallis for the free particle, obtained from different Lie symmetry reductions. Analytical expressions for the wave function, the auxiliary field and the probability density are derived using a variety of approaches. Solutions involving elliptic functions, Bessel and modified Bessel functions, as well as the inverse error function are found, amongst others. On the other hand, a closed-form expression for the general solution of the traveling wave ansatz (see Bountis and Nobre) is obtained for any real value of the nonlinearity index. This is achieved through the use of the so-called generalized trigonometric functions as defined by Lindqvist and Dr\'abek, the utility of which in analyzing the equation under study is highlighted throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>A study on the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz scenario through quadrics of kinetic energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A detailed description of the asymptotic behaviour in the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) scenario is presented through a simple geometric picture illustrating the geometry of their ordinary differential equations (ODE), which describe a neighbourhood of the cosmic singularity. The Lagrangian version of the dynamics governed by these equations is described in terms of trajectories inside a conical subset of the corresponding space of the generalised velocities. The calculations confirm that the initial conditions of decreasing volume inevitably result in eventual total collapse, while oscillations along paths reflecting from a hyperboloid, similar to those predicted by Kasner's solutions, occur on the way. The exact solution, found in our previous work, proves to be the only one that shrinks to a point along a differentiable path. Therefore, its instability means that the collapse is always chaotic. It is also shown that the BKL equations are not satisfied by the Kasner solutions exactly, even in the asymptotic regime, although the precision of their approximation may be high.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model in High Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bose-Hubbard model effectively describes bosons on a lattice with on-site interactions and nearest-neighbour hopping, serving as a foundational framework for understanding strong particle interactions and the superfluid to Mott insulator transition. This paper aims to rigorously establish the validity of a mean-field approximation for the dynamics of quantum systems in high dimension, using the Bose--Hubbard model on a square lattice as a case study. We prove a trace norm estimate between the one-lattice-site reduced density of the Schr\"odinger dynamics and the mean-field dynamics in the limit of large dimension. Here, the mean-field approximation is in the hopping amplitude and not in the interaction, leading to a very rich and non-trivial mean-field equation. This mean-field equation does not only describe the condensate, as is the case when the mean-field description comes from a large particle number limit averaging out the interaction, but it allows for a phase transition to a Mott insulator since it contains the full non-trivial interaction. Our work is a rigorous justification of a simple case of the highly successful dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for bosons, which somewhat surprisingly yields many qualitatively correct results in three dimensions.</description>

In the first three lectures, we introduce the main objects of the method, such as the WKB function, the integral equations of Volterra type, the quadratic differential and its horizontal/Stokes lines, the Stokes phenomenon, the notion of asymptotic values, the Fock-Goncharov coordinates and their WKB approximation. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillators in two asymptotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when the momentum (hence also the energy) is large.</description>

Abstract: Using brane quantization, we study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra of type $A_1$ in terms of the topological A-model on the moduli space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on a once-punctured torus. In particular, we provide an explicit match between finite-dimensional representations and A-branes with compact support; one consequence is the discovery of new finite-dimensional indecomposable representations. We proceed to embed the A-model story in an M-theory brane construction, closely related to the one used in the 3d/3d correspondence; as a result, we identify modular tensor categories behind particular finite-dimensional representations with PSL(2,Z) action. Using a further connection to the fivebrane system for the class S construction, we go on to study the relationship of Coulomb branch geometry and algebras of line operators in 4d N=2* theories to the double affine Hecke algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the theory of principal $\infty$-bundles of Niklaus-Schreiber-Steveson, we develop a homotopy categorification of Hopf algebras, which model quantum groups. We study their higher-representation theory in the setting of $\mathsf{2Vect}^{hBC}$, which is a homotopy refinement of the notion of 2-vector spaces of Baez-Crans that allows for higher coherence data. We construct in particular the \textit{2-quantum double} as a homotopy bicrossed product {\'a} la Majid, and prove its duality and factorization properties. We also define and characterize "{2-$R$-matrices}" universally, which can be seen as an extension of the usual notion of $R$-matrix in an ordinary quantum group. We found that the 2-Yang-Baxter equations describe the braiding of extended defects in 4d, similar to the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equations. The main results we prove in this paper is that the 2-representation 2-category of a weak 2-bialgebra is braided monoidal if and only if it is equipped with a universal 2-$R$-matrix, and that our homotopy quantization admits the theory of Lie 2-bialgebras as a semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Even Subgraph and Its Connection to Phase Transitions of Graphical Representations of the Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform even subgraph is intimately related to the Ising model, the random-cluster model, the random current model and the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model. In this paper, we first prove that the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ using its characterisation as the Haar measure on the group of even graphs. We then tighten the result by showing that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ percolates for $d \geq 2$ for edge-weights $x$ lying in some interval $(1-\varepsilon,1]$. Finally, our main theorem is that the loop $\mathrm{O}$(1) model and random current models corresponding to a supercritical Ising model are always at least critical, in the sense that their two-point correlation functions decay at most polynomially and the expected cluster sizes are infinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the canonical integrals associated to wheel graphs, and prove that they are proportional to odd zeta values. From this we deduce that wheel classes define explicit non-zero classes in: the locally finite homology of the general linear group $\GL_n(\ZZ)$ in both odd and even ranks, the homology of the moduli spaces of tropical curves, and the moduli space of tropical abelian varieties. We deduce the existence of a doubly infinite family of auxiliary classes in the even commutative graph complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bifurcation theory for infinite dimensional systems satisfying abstract hypotheses that are tailored for applications to mean field coupled chaotic maps. Our abstract theory can be applied to many cases, from globally coupled expanding maps to globally coupled Axiom A diffeomorphisms. To illustrate the range of applicability, we analyze an explicit example consisting of globally coupled Anosov diffeomorphisms. For such an example, we classify all the invariant measures as the coupling strength varies; we show which invariant measures are physical, and we prove that the existence of multiple invariant physical measures is a purely infinite dimensional phenomenon, i.e., the model exhibits phase transitions in the sense of statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>One loop effective actions in Kerr-(A)dS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss the exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions by providing a proof of the DHS formula and explicitly computing it for new relevant cases. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum space-time Poincar\'e inequality for Lindblad dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the mixing properties of primitive Markovian Lindblad dynamics (i.e., quantum Markov semigroups), where the detailed balance is disrupted by a coherent drift term. It is known that the sharp $L^2$-exponential convergence rate of Lindblad dynamics is determined by the spectral gap of the generator. We show that incorporating a Hamiltonian component into a detailed balanced Lindbladian can generically enhance its spectral gap, thereby accelerating the mixing. In addition, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the spectral gap for Lindblad dynamics with a large coherent contribution. However, estimating the spectral gap, particularly for a non-detailed balanced Lindbladian, presents a significant challenge. In the case of hypocoercive Lindblad dynamics, we extend the variational framework originally developed for underdamped Langevin dynamics to derive fully explicit and constructive exponential decay estimates for convergence in the noncommutative $L^2$-norm. This analysis relies on establishing a quantum analog of space-time Poincar\'{e} inequality. Furthermore, we provide several examples with connections to quantum noise and quantum Gibbs samplers as applications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Theory of Complex Particle without Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

The analysis we present is based on a detailed study of sparse mode interactions suggested by the previous numerical work. Our results complement prior rigorous existence proofs and suggest that solutions exist for any frequency, however, they may be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Quantifying non-Markovianity via local quantum Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovianity in open quantum systems (OQSs) is gaining increasing attention due to its profound implications for quantum information processing. This phenomenon arises from the system's evolution being influenced by its previous interactions with the environment. To better understand these complex dynamics, various measures have been proposed, including those based on divisibility, quantum mutual information, and trace distance. Each of these measures provides a different perspective on the behavior of OQSs. Here, we introduce a novel approach to quantifying non-Markovianity by focusing on metrological non-classical correlations. This approach is based on a discord-like measure of quantum correlations for multi-component quantum systems known as local quantum Fisher information (LQFI), which was introduced in [58]. It is defined as the minimization of quantum Fisher information with respect to local observables and measurements. Thereby, we examine some examples to clarify the use of our metric by applying it to three different channels: the phase damping channel, the amplitude damping channel, and the depolarizing channel. In contrast to other approaches, this new metric focuses on correlated bipartite $2\otimes d$ systems, has a clear physical interpretation, and effectively captures the features of non-Markovianity. We demonstrate that the non-Markovian or Markovian evolution of an open correlated bipartite system corresponds to an increase or decrease, respectively, in the quantumness of the quantum state. This quantumness is quantified by the maximum of the measurement-induced Fisher information across all local von Neumann measurements. Compared to measuring non-Markovianity based on local quantum uncertainty, a measure of non-classical correlation of the discord type based on single observables, our results confirm that the ..</description>

      <title>The full electroweak interaction: an autonomous account</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise renormalizable interactions in the bosonic sector of electroweak theory are intrinsically determined in the autonomous approach to perturbation theory. This proceeds directly on the Hilbert-Fock space built on the Wigner unirreps of the physical particles, with their given masses: those of three massive vector bosons, a photon, and a massive scalar (the "higgs"). Neither "gauge choices" nor an unobservable "mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking" are invoked. Instead, to proceed on Hilbert space requires using string-localized fields to describe the vector bosons. In such a framework, the condition of string independence of the S-matrix yields consistency constraints on the coupling coefficients, the unique outcome being the experimentally known one. The analysis can be largely carried out for other configurations of massive and massless vector bosons, paving the way towards consideration of consistent mass patterns beyond those of the electroweak theory.</description>

      <title>Bridging 4D QFTs and 2D VOAs via 3D high-temperature EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</description>

      <title>Graded discrete Heisenberg and Drinfeld doubles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of $U_q(sl(2))$ and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of $U_q(osp(1|2))$ and the Borel half of $U_q(gl(1|1))$ for $q$ being a root of unity. We prove an isomorphism between the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory and illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full $U_q(gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <title>Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group action on category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of $C^\vee C_1$, using brane quantization. By showing a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support and finite-dimensional representations of the spherical DAHA, we provide evidence of derived equivalence between the $A$-brane category of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of a four-punctured sphere and the representation category of DAHA of $C^\vee C_1$. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. In particular, this $A$-model approach reveals the action of an affine braid group of type $D_4$ on the category. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy effective dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional permutons: theory and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutons, which are probability measures on the unit square $[0, 1]^2$ with uniform marginals, are the natural scaling limits for sequences of (random) permutations.
  We introduce a $d$-dimensional generalization of these measures for all $d \ge 2$, which we call $d$-dimensional permutons, and extend -- from the two-dimensional setting -- the theory to prove convergence of sequences of (random) $d$-dimensional permutations to (random) $d$-dimensional permutons.
  Building on this new theory, we determine the random high-dimensional permuton limits for two natural families of high-dimensional permutations. First, we determine the $3$-dimensional permuton limit for Schnyder wood permutations, which bijectively encode planar triangulations decorated by triples of spanning trees known as Schnyder woods. Second, we identify the $d$-dimensional permuton limit for $d$-separable permutations, a pattern-avoiding class of $d$-dimensional permutations generalizing ordinary separable permutations.
  Both high-dimensional permuton limits are random and connected to previously studied universal 2-dimensional permutons, such as the Brownian separable permutons and the skew Brownian permutons, and share interesting connections with objects arising from random geometry, including the continuum random tree, Schramm--Loewner evolutions, and Liouville quantum gravity surfaces.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of One-Dimensional Random Band Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an $ N \times N$ Hermitian one-dimensional random band matrix with band width $W &gt; N^{1 / 2 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0$. In the bulk of the spectrum and in the large $ N $ limit, we obtain the following results: (i) The semicircle law holds up to the scale $ N^{-1 + \varepsilon} $ for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (ii) All $ L^2 $- normalized eigenvectors are delocalized, meaning their $ L^\infty$ norms are simultaneously bounded by $ N^{-\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon} $ with overwhelming probability, for any $ \varepsilon &gt; 0 $. (iii) Quantum unique ergodicity holds in the sense that the local $ L^2 $ mass of eigenvectors becomes equidistributed with high probability. (iv) Universality of eigenvalue statistics, i.e., the local eigenvalue statistics of these band matrices are given by those of Gaussian unitary ensembles.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Noise Mitigation: Practical Implementation, Error Analysis, and the Role of Environment Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM), conceived as an error suppression paradigm without the need for additional ancilla qubits for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, presents a promising avenue for realizing quantum speedups of quantum computing algorithms on current quantum devices. However, prior investigations have predominantly focused on Markovian noise. In this paper, we propose non-Markovian Noise Mitigation (NMNM) method by extending the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) method in the QEM framework to treat non-Markovian noise. We present the derivation of a time-local quantum master equation where the decoherence coefficients are directly obtained from bath correlation functions (BCFs), key properties of a non-Markovian environment that make the error mitigation algorithms environment-aware. We further establish a direct connection between the overall approximation error and sampling overhead of QEM and the spectral property of the environment. Numerical simulations performed on the spin-boson model further validate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Semisimplifications and representations of the General Linear Supergroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semisimplification of the full karoubian subcategory generated by the irreducible finite dimensional representations of the algebraic supergroup $GL(m|n)$ over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. This semisimplification is equivalent to the representations of a pro-reductive group $H_{m|n}$. We show that there is a canonical decomposition $H_{m|n} \cong GL(m\!-\! n) \times H_{n|n}$, thereby reducing the determination of $H_{m|n}$ to the equal rank case $m\! =\! n$ which was treated in a previous paper.</description>
