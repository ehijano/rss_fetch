      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Anomalous wave-packet transport on boundaries of Floquet topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional periodically driven (Floquet) system with zero winding number in the absence of time-reversal symmetry is usually considered topologically trivial. Here, we study the dynamics of a Gaussian wave packet placed at the boundary of a two-dimensional driven system with zero winding numbers but multiple valley-protected edge states that can be realized in a square Raman lattice, and investigate the unidirectionally propagating topological edge currents. By carefully tuning the initial parameters of the wave packet including its spin polarization as well as the initial time of the periodic driving, we control the population of different edge states, where the speed of the resulting propagation establishes a direct correspondence with the target dispersions across different gaps and valleys. Interestingly, we find that the edge states at different valleys in the $\pi$ gap can hybridize and form bowtie-shaped edge bands fully detached from the bulk. This phase, not only presents a favorable regime with narrower bulk bands, but also exhibits distinct edge dynamics where the majority of particles bounce back-and-forth confined to a boundary while a small portion can follow a chiral transport around the sample.</description>

      <title>Transition temperature of homogeneous weakly interacting Bose gas in self-consistent Popov approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action framework in conjunction with variational perturbation theory, this study investigates the relative shift in the transition temperature of a homogeneous repulsive weakly interacting Bose gas compared to that of an ideal Bose gas. Employing both one-loop and self-consistent Popov approximations, we derive the universal form of the relative shift in the transition temperature, which is proportional to the s-wave scattering length. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with those obtained through precise Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the zero-point energy and various thermodynamic quantities are also analyzed in the condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Contractive Unitary and Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below $\mathbf{2^k}$ for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size $\sim \mathbf{k}$ remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller sample complexity of $\mathbf{\sim 1.8^k}$ using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic global unitary, termed as \textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics in topologically non-trivial quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a groundstate fermionic many body gas subjected to a quench between parameter regimes of a topologically nontrivial Hamiltonian. By focusing on the role of the chiral edge states inherent to the system, we calculate the many body overlap and show that the characteristic monotonic decay of the orthogonality catastrophe with increasing system size is notably altered. Specifically, we demonstrate that the dynamics are governed not solely by the total particle number but rather by the number of occupied single particle edge states. This behavior is further explained through an analysis of the full work probability distribution, providing a deeper understanding of the system's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and decoherence in cosmology and in analogue gravity experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is dedicated to analysing the generation and destruction of quantum correlations in the context of inflationary cosmology and an experiment of 'analogue' preheating. Inflation is a phase of accelerated expansion of the Universe, preceding the so-called Standard Model of Big Bang cosmology, introduced to solve some shortcomings of this model. It also provides a mechanism for the emergence of primordial inhomogeneities by amplification of initial quantum fluctuations. Inflation is followed by a 'reheating' period, in which most particles are expected to be generated and reach thermal equilibrium, setting the stage for the standard Big Bang of cosmology. During a 'preheating' period, this creation proceeds partly by parametric excitation of resonant modes of the matter fields initially in their vacuum, a genuine quantum process. The physics of both situations, inflation and preheating, is that of a strong classical field acting on a quantum field to produce entangled (quasi-)particles. When the classical source is the space-time metric itself, as in inflation, we are in the framework of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space-time (QFTCS). The evolution of the generated quantum correlations is the topic of this PhD.</description>

      <title>Single-atom resolved collective spectroscopy of a one-dimensional atomic array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical response compared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference in resonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.</description>

      <title>Few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations in a superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the creation of few-body atomic Fermi gases with attractive interactions, we study theoretically the few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations, which for large particle numbers evolve into a mode that describes amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter (the "Higgs" mode). Our analysis is based on the hypothesis that salient aspects of the excitation spectrum are captured by interactions between time-reversed pair states in a harmonic oscillator potential. Microscopically, this assumption leads to a Richardson-type pairing model, which is integrable and thus allows a systematic quantitative study of the few-to-many-particle crossover with only minor numerical effort. We first establish a parity effect in the ground-state energy, i.e., a spectral convexity in the energy of open-shell configurations compared to their closed-shell neighbors, which is quantified by a so-called Matveev-Larkin parameter discussed for mesoscopic superconductors, which generalizes the pairing gap to mesoscopic ensembles and which behaves quantitatively differently in a few-body and a many-body regime. The crossover point for this quantity is widely tunable as a function of interaction strength. We then compute the excitation spectrum and demonstrate that the pair excitation energy shows a minimum that deepens with increasing particle number and shifts to smaller interaction strengths, consistent with the finite-size precursor of a quantum phase transition to a superfluid state. We extract a critical finite-size scaling exponent that characterizes the decrease of the gap with increasing particle number.</description>

Abstract: Atom-ion hybrid systems are promising platforms for the quantum simulation of polaron physics in certain quantum materials. Here, we investigate the ionic Fermi polaron, a charged impurity in a polarized Fermi bath, at zero temperature using quantum Monte Carlo techniques. We compute the energy spectrum, residue, effective mass, and structural properties. Significant deviations from field-theory prediction occur in the strong coupling regime due to large density inhomogeneities around the ion. We observe a smooth polaron-molecule transition in contrast with the neutral case. This study provides insights into solid-state systems like Fermi exciton polarons in thin semiconductors and quantum technologies based on atom-ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum noise on phase transitions in an atom-cavity system with limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are inherent in open quantum systems and they affect not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. Using a generic minimal model, we show that quantum noise smoothens the transition between a stationary and a dynamical phase corresponding to a limit cycle (LC) in the semiclassical mean-field approximation of a generic open quantum system. Employing truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by the standard mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced emergence of temporal ordering. Our work demonstrates that the apparent crossover-like behaviour between stationary phases brought by finite-size effects from quantum fluctuations also apply to transitions involving dynamical phases. To demonstrate this on a specific physical system, we consider a transversely pumped atom-cavity setup, wherein LCs have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). We compare the oscillation frequencies of the LCs in the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, and find that the frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D. This has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: The interactions between Rydberg atoms and microwave fields provide a valuable framework for studying the complex dynamics out of equilibrium, exotic phases, and critical phenomena in many-body physics. This unique interplay allows us to explore various regimes of nonlinearity and phase transitions. Here, we observe a phase transition from the state in the regime of bistability to that in multistability in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms by varying the microwave field intensity, accompanying with the breaking of Z3-symmetry. During the phase transition, the system experiences a hidden critical point, in which the multistable states are difficult to be identified. Through changing the initial state of system, we can identify a hidden multistable state and reveal a hidden trajectory of phase transition, allowing us to track to a hidden critical point. In addition, we observe multiple phase transitions in spectra, suggesting higher-order symmetry breaking. The reported results shed light on manipulating multistability in dissipative Rydberg atoms systems and hold promise in the applications of non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is key to advancing our understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, provide a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion in microscopic detail. Here, in a new twist, we disentangle the role of particle statistics from the physics of strong correlations by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped \emph{bosonic} quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we map out the phase diagram on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. In the low-doping regime, bosonic holes form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases, a transition occurs to a partially-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) phase, driven by the motion of mobile bosonic charge carriers forming Nagaoka polarons. At high doping or large $t/J$, the system evolves into a fully-polarized ferromagnet. These findings shed new light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated many-body systems, revealing connections to stripe formation and the physics of kinetic (i.e., Nagaoka-type) ferromagnetism. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms with bosonic quantum gas microscopes and Rydberg atom tweezer arrays, paving the way for future experimental studies of doped bosonic quantum magnets.</description>
