      <title>Shear stresses in fluid and solid membranes with bending elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparison of a few simple models of fluid and solid membranes illustrates how shear stresses can arise from a bending energy through a coupling between curvature and surface stresses, a feature incidental to the fluid or solid nature of the material. In particular, it is shown how a fluid-like Helfrich bending energy contributes shear stresses, while a related solid-like energy, the correct continuum limit of a Seung-Nelson discrete bending term, produces a stress tensor with purely isotropic tangential part. An important distinction is noted between the resistance to tangential flows on the surface and the ability to support tangential stresses. The tangential projection of the divergence of the stress, or the pseudomomentum balance, is viewed in the light of some statements and observations in the literature. Different types of constraints, invariance properties, and shape equations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Driven Preordering Assists Nucleation in Polyethylene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-classical two-step nucleation including preordering and crystal nucleation has been widely proposed to challenge the one-step nucleation framework in diverse materials, while what drives preordering has not been explicitly resolved yet. With molecular dynamics simulation, we find that two-step nucleation occurs in polyethylene, during which preordering precedes through the coupling between intrachain conformation and interchain orientation orders. Unexpectedly, preordering is driven by entropy rather than enthalpy, during which the interchain translational entropy gain compensates for the intrachain conformation entropy loss. This entropy-driven mechanism resolves the longstanding puzzle why flexible polymers with high entropy penalty still show high nucleation rate and opens a new perspective for understanding nucleation of synthetic and bio-polymers with conformation and orientation orders.</description>

      <title>Findings of sub-$T_\mathrm{g}$ endotherm in vapor-deposited ultrastable phenolphthalein glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed differential scanning calorimetric and synchrotron x-ray diffraction studies to elucidate the nature of vapor-deposited ultrastable phenolphthalein glass. As a result, we found that phenolphthalein forms the ultrastable glass by depositing at 313 K, which is about 0.86 times the ordinal glass transition temperature of 361 K. As previous ultrastable glass studies reported, this ultrastable state involved an anisotropic structure. In addition, we found that a large endotherm (sub-$T_\mathrm{g}$ endotherm) was observed in the temperature range between deposition and ordinal glass transition temperatures. We have assessed the stability of deposited states thermodynamically and found that those states are much more stable than those crystalline states when the deposition rate is small enough. The total enthalpies associated with the sub-$T_\mathrm{g}$ endotherm are roughly proportional to the powers of the inversed thickness of the deposited glass. Despite the thermodynamical evidence, wide-angle x-ray diffraction of the structure associated with the sub-$T_\mathrm{g}$ endotherm was unchanged. Following our findings, we have proposed a scenario in which ultrastable vapor-deposited phenolphthalein glass is rooted in locally superstable structure. Our locally oriented scenario would be universal for forming stable structures in other vapor-deposited glasses.</description>

      <title>Curling morphology of knitted fabrics: Structure and Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knitted fabrics are two-dimensional-like structures formed by stitching one-dimensional yarn into three-dimensional curves. Plain stitch or stockinette stitch, one of the most fundamental knitting stitches, consists of periodic lattices of bent yarns, where three-dimensional (3D) curling behavior naturally emerges at the edges. The elasticity and geometry of knitted fabrics have been studied in previous studies, primarily based on 2D modeling. Still, the relation between 3D geometry and the mechanics of knitted fabrics has not been clarified so far. The curling behavior of knits is intricately related to the forces and moments acting on the yarns, geometry of the unit knitted loops, mechanical properties, and contacts, hence requiring a 3D analysis. Here, we show that the curling of plain knits emerges through the elasticity and geometry of the knitted loops, combining desktop-scale experiments and reduced elasticity-based simulations. We find that by changing the horizontal and vertical knitting numbers, three types of curl shapes emerge: side curl and top/bottom curl shapes, which are curled only horizontally and vertically, and double curl shape, in which both curl shapes appear together. The fundamental mechanism of intricate shape deformation is clarified through the force and moment balance along yarn whose centerline shape is discretized through the B-spline curves where elastic stretching, bending, and contact mechanics are taken into account. We reveal that the 3D structure of the single-knitted loop plays a critical role in the curling behavior. Our results imply that the change in shape per a single knitted loop has the potential to control the 3D natural overall shape of knitted fabrics, and could be applied in predicting or designing more complex 3D shapes made of knitted fabrics.</description>

      <title>Active-hydraulic flows solve the 6-vertex model (and vice versa)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By confining colloidal active fluids in microchannel networks, we demonstrate that their degenerate flows corresponds to the configurations of the six-vertex model. We use this quantitative correspondence to control and explain the active flows that emerge in square grid networks. In particular, we show that the Lagrangian trajectories of active particles realize the Baxter-Kelland-Wu mapping and form completely packed loops, whose geometry can be exactly predicted and explained. We then go beyond the square-grid geometry and introduce a general framework for predicting the geometry of active-hydraulic flows in arbitrary networks.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical micro-rheology of complex fluids at ultra-high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optomechanical method for locally measuring the rheological properties of complex fluids in the ultra-high frequency range (UHF). A mechanical disk of microscale volume is used as a small-amplitude oscillating probe that monitors the fluid at rest in thermal equilibrium, while the oscillation is detected by optomechanical transduction within a sub-millisecond measurement time, thanks to an optimized signal collection. An original analytical model for fluid-structure interactions is used to extract from these measurements the rheological properties of liquids over the frequency range 100 MHz - 1 GHz. This new micro-rheology method is calibrated by measurements on liquid water, in which we observe pronounced compressibility effects above 500 MHz, but which we show remains Newtonian all over the explored range. In contrast, measurements reveal that liquid 1-decanol exhibits a non-Newtonian behavior, with a frequency-dependent viscosity associated to several relaxation frequencies in the UHF. Our data agree well with an extended Maxwell model for the viscosity of this alcohol, involving two relaxation times of 797 and 151 picoseconds, which are respectively analyzed as supramolecular and intramolecular relaxation processes. A shear elastic response of the liquid appears at the highest frequencies, compatible with the entropic elasticity of molecules as they attempt to uncurl, and whose value enables estimating the volume of a single molecule of liquid. UHF optomechanical micro-rheology demonstrates here a direct mechanical access to the fast molecular dynamics at play in a liquid, in a quantitative manner and in a short time.</description>

      <title>Memory of rotation in residual stress of paste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stress distribution in pastes after horizontal rotation by using an elasto-plastic model. Residual stress remains as a memory of rotation. The stress in the circumferential direction increases after the rotation, whereas that in the radial direction decreases. The residual stress is analytically related to the plastic deformation induced by the rotation. Based on the time evolution of plastic deformation, we theoretically describe the mechanism of the changes in the stress distribution.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of dense systems of active polar disks in circular confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emerging collective states in a simple mechanical model of a dense group of self-propelled polar disks confined within a circular arena. Each disk has its center of rotation located at a distance R behind its centroid, so its central linear contact forces can produce torques leading to mutual alignment. Each disk is thus affected by this mutual alignment to its neighbors' orientations and by self-alignment (resulting from disk-substrate interactions) towards the sum of forces over it. The effect of both alignment mechanisms produces a variety of collective states combining high-frequency localized circular oscillations with low-frequency milling around the center of the arena, in fluid or solid regimes. We consider cases with small/large R values, isotropic/anisotropic disk-substrate damping, smooth/rough arena boundaries, different densities, and multiple systems sizes, showing that the identified emergent collective states are robust, generic, and potentially observable in real-world natural or artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of Topology on Rheological Properties of Polymer Ring Melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate with numerical simulations the influence of topology and stiffness on macroscopic rheological properties of polymer melts consisting of unknotted, knotted or concatenated rings. While melts of flexible, knotted oligomer rings tend to be significantly more viscous than their unknotted counterparts, differences vanish in a low shear rate scenario with increasing degree of polymerization. Melts of catenanes consisting of two rings on the other hand are consistently more viscous than their unconcatenated counterparts. These topology-based differences in rheological properties can be exploited to segregate mixtures of otherwise chemically similar polymers, e.g., in microfluidic devices, which is demonstrated by exposing a blend of flexible knotted and unknotted oligomer rings to channel flow.</description>

      <title>A universality class for RNA-like polymers and double polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the statistics of conformations of a linear polymer in a solvent. The polymer is allowed to form double polymers. We closely follow a classical technique to derive a field theory for the problem from an $O\left(n\right)$ symmetric spin model. The field theory is a model for RNA or DNA with constant binding energy per monomer.
  It is shown that there is a stable renormalization group fixed point, at which the double polymer decouples from the single-strand polymer and becomes a branched polymer of the conventional type with a three-point interaction. To reach this fixed point, at least one parameter must be adjusted. The critical dimension is eight. Fisher-renormalization, equation of state and critical exponents are reproduced in this limit. The single-strand polymer depends on the double-strand polymer and disappears at the critical point, but has its own critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Anomalous behaviour of transport properties in a supercooled water-glycerol mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glycerol acts as a natural cryoprotectant by depressing the temperature of ice nucleation and slowing down the dynamics of water mixtures. In this work we characterize dynamics -- diffusion, viscosity, and hydrogen-bond dynamics -- as well as density anomaly and structure of water mixtures with 1\% to 50\% w/w glycerol at low temperatures via molecular dynamics simulations using all-atom and coarse-grained models. Simulations reveal distinct violations of the Stokes-Einsten relation in the low temperature regime for water and glycerol. Deviations are positive for water at all concentrations, and positive for glycerol in very dilute solutions but turning negative in concentrated ones. The all-atom and coarse-grained models reveal an unexpected crossover in the dynamics of the 1% and 10 % w/w glycerol at the lowest simulated temperatures. This crossover manifests in the diffusion coefficients of water and glycerol, as well as in the viscosity and lifetime of hydrogen-bonds in water. We interpret that the crossover originates on the opposing dependence with glycerol concentration of the two factors controlling the solution's slow-down: the increase in tetrahedrally coordinated water and the dynamics and clustering of the glycerol molecules. We anticipate that this dynamic crossover will also occur for solution of water with other polyols.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte-Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.</description>
