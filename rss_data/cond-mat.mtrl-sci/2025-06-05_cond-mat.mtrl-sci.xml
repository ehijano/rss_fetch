      <title>Novel Experimental Platform to realize One-dimensional Quantum Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Templated porous materials, such as MCM-41, due to the uniformity of their onedimensional structure and scalability in synthesis, have emerged as an attractive medium for studying one-dimensional quantum fluids. However, the experimental challenge of synthesizing these materials with pore radii smaller than 15 Angstroms hinders the realization of a one-dimensional quantum liquid of helium within such systems, as the coherence length of helium is shorter than the pore radius. Recently, DelMaestro et. al. have preplated MCM-41 with Ar resulting in a reduction of the pore size and a softening of the adsorption potential allowing them to observe 1D Tomanga-Luttinger liquid like behavior. In this paper we present a novel method to obtain an even more ideal environment for studying the behavior of 1D 4He. We propose preplating MCM-41 pores with cesium (Cs) metal. The non-wetting nature of helium on a Cs-coated surface, coupled with the large atomic radius of cesium, creates an optimal environment for confining a quantum liquid of helium in one-dimensional geometry. We present preliminary measurements of adsorption isotherms and Small Angle X-ray Scattering studies that 1reveal a reduction in pore radius upon preplating MCM-41 with Cs, demonstrating promising prospects for facilitating the realization of one-dimensional quantum fluids in templated porous materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for energy-efficient hardware for artificial intelligence (AI) and data centres requires integrated photonic solutions delivering optical transceivers with Tbit/s data rates and energy consumption$&lt;$1pJ/bit. Here, we report double single-layer graphene electro-absorption modulators on Si optimized for energy-efficient and ultra-fast operation, demonstrating 67GHz bandwidth and 80Gbit/s data rate, in both O and C bands, using a fabrication tailored for wafer-scale integration. We measure a data rate$\sim$1.6 times larger than previously reported for graphene. We scale the modulator's active area down to 22$\mu$m$^2$, achieving a dynamic power consumption$\sim$58fJ/bit, $\sim$3 times lower than previous graphene modulators and Mach-Zehnder modulators based on Si or lithium niobate. We show devices with$\sim$0.037dB/V$\mu$m modulation efficiency,$\sim$16 times better than previous demonstrations based on graphene. This paves the way to wafer-scale production of graphene modulators on Si useful for Tbit/s optical transceivers and energy-efficient AI</description>

      <title>Itinerant versus localized magnetism in spin gapped metallic half-Heusler compounds: Stoner criterion and magnetic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin gapped metals have recently emerged as promising candidates for spintronic and nanoelectronic applications, enabling functionalities such as sub-60mV/dec switching, negative differential resistance, and non-local spin-valve effects in field-effect transistors. Realizing these functionalities, however, requires a deeper understanding of their magnetic behavior, which is governed by a subtle interplay between localized and itinerant magnetism. This interplay is particularly complex in spin gapped metallic half-Heusler compounds, whose magnetic properties remain largely unexplored despite previous studies of their electronic structure. In this work, we systematically investigate the magnetic behavior of spin gapped metallic half-Heusler compounds XYZ (X = Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Ir, Pd, Pt; Y = Ti, V, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta; Z = In, Sn, Sb), revealing clear trends. Co- and Ni-based compounds predominantly exhibit itinerant magnetism, whereas Ti-, V-, and Fe-based systems may host localized moments, itinerant moments, or a coexistence of both. To uncover the origin of magnetism, we apply the Stoner model, with the Stoner parameter I estimated from Coulomb interaction parameters (Hubbard U and Hund's exchange J) computed using the constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). Our analysis shows that compounds not satisfying the Stoner criterion tend to remain non-magnetic. On the contrary compounds, which satisfy the Stoner criterion, generally exhibit magnetic ordering highlighting the crucial role of electronic correlations and band structure effects in the emergence of magnetism. For compounds with magnetic ground states, we compute Heisenberg exchange parameters, estimate Curie temperatures (T_C), and analyze spin-wave properties, including magnon dispersions and stiffness constants.</description>

      <title>Propylenidene: A New Carbon Two-dimensional Material Featuring Tilted Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have drawn significant interest owing to their impressive physical and chemical characteristics. Following graphene's isolation, a wide range of 2D carbon materials has been suggested, each with distinct electronic, mechanical, and optical traits. Rational design and synthesis of new 2D carbon structures hinge on experimentally reported precursors. Here, we present a 2D carbon allotrope, propylenidene (PPD), originating from the highly strained bicyclopropylidene precursor. PPD forms a rectangular lattice with 3, 8, and 10-membered carbon rings. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations investigate its structural, electronic, mechanical, and optical properties. Our study shows PPD is semi-metallic, featuring three tilted Dirac cones at the Fermi level. PPD exhibits absorption in the infrared and visible range, showing directional dependence in its response. Mechanically, PPD exhibits marked anisotropy; Young's modulus ($Y$) of 219.71 N/m in one direction and 106.16 N/m in the opposite, with an anisotropy ratio of 2.07. The shear modulus ($G$) ranges from 65.38 N/m to 32.39 N/m, yielding an anisotropy ratio of 2.02, reflecting strong directional dependence. These findings underscore the potential of this novel monolayer in applications such as energy storage, gas sensing, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>High-pressure Induced Phase Transition and Laser Characterization Response of MAPbBr$_3$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-pressure behavior of 3D metal halide chalcogenides (MHPs) has been widely studied. In the field of high-pressure technology, the studies on 3D MHPs have focused on the structural and optical properties, where the optical properties are mainly investigated on the photoluminescence behavior, while the laser properties of the materials have not been studied yet. In this paper, MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films with ionic liquid methylammonium acetate (MAAc) as solvent and conventional MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films with N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as solvents were prepared using solvent engineering method. In-situ pressurization testing of both materials using a small-cavity hydrostatic high-pressure device (DAC) was used to investigate the high-pressure optical behavior of the MAPbBr$_3$ films, especially the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) properties, which, combined with high-pressure in-situ Raman, revealed that the changes in the optical properties of the films under pressure are due to the changes in the crystal structure of the materials. This paper also emphasizes that the optical properties and phase structure stability of MAPbBr$_3$-MAAc films are superior to those of MAPbBr$_3$-DMF:DMSO films under high pressure.</description>

      <title>The isostructural alpha-gamma phase transition in cerium from the perspective of meta-generalized gradient approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-generalized gradient approximations (meta-GGAs) on the third rung of the functional hierarchy are gaining increasing relevance for the electronic structure. Meta-GGAs are constructed from numerous ingredients including the orbital kinetic energy density that make them more flexible than generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) including the heavily used PBE-GGA. Still, most meta-GGAs cope with the expected limitations of a semilocal density functional when band gaps or localization of electrons are needed. On the other hand, meta-GGAs are implicit functionals of the orbitals. This feature resembles hybrid density functionals with exact exchange. Efforts in recent years demonstrate that some meta-GGAs can rise beyond the accuracy of semilocal approximation when band gaps are computed. Cerium is an ideal testbed to challenge some recent meta-GGAs. Cerium shows an isostructural alpha - gamma phase transition with delocalized and localized f electrons in each phase, respectively. Since the phonon entropy term was found negligible in the alpha - gamma phase transition of cerium by accurate experiments, all changes in the transition are driven by electronic correlation. The correlation of f electron systems is hardly captured by semilocal approximations but the recent LAK meta-GGA with ultranonlocality steps out of the framework of conventional semilocal density functionals and delivers spectacular accuracy for the phase transition of cerium. LAK and further meta-GGAs inspired by the success of LAK can open a forefront of meta-GGAs for quantum materials with localized electrons.</description>

      <title>Gefitinib-Induced Interface Engineering Enhances the Defect Formation Energy for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as a hole transport layer in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the high interface defect density and energy level mismatch between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite can lead to significant open-circuit voltage loss. Additionally, the free PSS chains on the surface of PEDOT:PSS can absorb water molecules, promoting the degradation of perovskite at the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite interface. Here, gefitinib is used to modify the surface of PEDOT:PSS, removing a portion of the free PSS chains from the surface, reducing the PSS/PEDOT ratio, and enhancing the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS. Gefitinib has altered the energy level structure of PEDOT:PSS, facilitating hole transport at the interface. The Cl, F, and NH groups in gefitinib also passivated defects in the perovskite, reducing the defect density at the interface and significantly enhancing the stability of PSCs. This modification increased the open-circuit voltage from 1.077 to 1.110 V and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.01% to 19.63%. When gefitinib was used to modify the interface between SnO2 and perovskite, the PCE of PSCs (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMETAD/Au) increased from 22.46% to 23.89%. This approach provides new perspectives and strategies for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast switching of photoinduced phonon chirality in the antiferrochiral BPO$_{4}$ crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In crystalline systems, chiral crystals cannot interconvert to their enantiomorph post-synthesis without undergoing melting-recrystallization processes. However, recent work indicates that ultrafast terahertz-polarized light has been shown to enable dynamic control of structural chirality in the antiferrochiral boron phosphate (BPO$_4$) crystal. Here, using first-principles calculations and nonlinear phonon dynamics simulations, we investigate the underlying physics of lattice dynamics in this system. The results demonstrate that polarized optical pumping not only induces chiral phonons but also establishes a chirality-selective filtering mechanism, both of which can be reversibly switched by tuning the polarization of the excitation pulse. Furthermore, under a temperature gradient, the pump-induced chiral phonons give rise to ultrafast phonon magnetization, with its direction also controllable via light polarization. Our findings establish a new paradigm for ultrafast optical control of phonon chirality via dynamic chirality switching, offering promising opportunities for chiral information transfer and the design of chiral phononic devices.</description>

      <title>Magic of nonlocal geometric force: lighting up optical transition and transporting angular momentum by chiral phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the nonlocal geometric force -- arising from the molecular Berry curvature -- on the lattice dynamics of magnetic materials with broken time-reversal symmetry. A first-principles computational framework is established to evaluate this force across the entire Brillouin zone. We apply it to monolayer CoCl$_2$, a ferromagnetic half-semiconductor with a narrow bandgap forbidding direct dipolar optical transition. At the phonon Brillouin zone center, the pronounced nonlocal geometric force leads to a splitting of the two upper optical phonon branches by $3 \times 10^{-2}$ THz, transforming the phonons into chiral modes. Optical chiral phonons can light up the intravalley dark exciton via absorpting circularly polarized photons. Furthermore, acoustic chiral phonons induced by the nonlocal geometric force can transport angular momentum and contribute to a non-dissipative phonon Hall viscosity.</description>

      <title>Efficient and standardized interface energy calculations in hybrid heterostructures using fictitious atoms surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures combining diverse physico-chemical properties are increasingly in demand for a wide range of applications in modern science and technology. However, despite their importance in materials science, accurately determining absolute interface energies remains a major challenge. This difficulty arises from periodic boundary conditions, high computational costs of plane-wave methods, multipolar interactions in heterostructures, the need for thick slabs for interface convergence, and reconstructed surfaces on both slab faces. Here, we introduce a standardized and computationally efficient fictitious H* charge passivation method for the surface termination, designed to accurately determine absolute interface energies in heterogeneous materials associations. This approach effectively addresses issues associated with surface reconstructions while significantly reducing computational costs within the framework of density functional theory. To demonstrate its reliability, we calculate the absolute interface energies for various quasi-lattice-matched and lattice-mismatched abrupt III-V/Si interfaces using the H* passivation technique and benchmark the results against those obtained using conventional reconstructed surface methods. We further explore the early stages of strained epitaxial GaAs on Si(001). Finally, we assess the fictitious H* passivation method, showing its effectiveness in minimizing electric dipole errors, reducing computational costs, and thus decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from high-performance computing. Finally, the potential of the approach to compute interface energies across a broad spectrum of materials is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diamond: Interpretable Machine Learning Discovery of Coherent Quantum Defect Hosts in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum point defects in wide bandgap semiconductors-such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond are leading candidates for solid-state spin qubits due to their long coherence times and optically addressable spin states. Yet, identifying host materials capable of supporting such deep-level defects remains a significant challenge, owing to the complex interplay between chemical composition, crystal structure, and electronic environment. Here, we present a scalable, interpretable machine learning framework that combines density functional theory (DFT)-informed descriptors with a structure-agnostic ensemble model to predict quantum-compatible defect-host materials. Trained on a curated dataset from the Materials Project and ICSD, our model achieves a high Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC &gt; 0.95) and assigns confidence scores to guide prioritization of candidates. First-principles calculations of coherence-relevant properties, including static dielectric constants and defect formation energetics, validate key predictions. While high dielectric response is a necessary but not sufficient condition for spin coherence, our model successfully recovers known hosts such as diamond and SiC, and reveals previously overlooked candidates such as WS2 , MgO, CaS and TiO2 . This approach establishes a robust path for discovering next-generation quantum materials, bridging data-driven screening with physically interpretable design principles.</description>

      <title>Large Berry curvature effects induced by extended nodal structures: Rational design strategy and high-throughput materials predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry curvature can drastically modify the electron dynamics, thereby offering an effective pathway for electron manipulation and novel device applications. Compared to zero-dimensional nodal points in Weyl/Dirac semimetals, higher-dimensional extended nodal structures, such as nodal lines and nodal surfaces, are more likely to intersect the Fermi surface, leading to large Berry curvature effects without fine-tuning the chemical potential. In this work, we propose a strategy that utilizes straight nodal lines (SNLs) and flat nodal surfaces (FNSs) to design large Berry curvature effects, and we exhaustively tabulate SNLs and FNSs within the 1651 magnetic space groups (MSGs). We demonstrate that SNLs and FNSs can generate large Berry curvature widely distributed in the Brillouin zone. As an application, we identify 158 MSGs that host FNSs, SNLs, or both and allow for nonvanishing anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). Based on these 158 MSGs, we screen materials from the MAGNDATA magnetic material database for high-throughput calculations, identifying 60 materials with AHC values exceeding $500\,\Omega^{-1}{\rm cm}^{-1}$. We select the candidate materials $\rm SrRuO_3$ and $\rm Ca_2NiOsO_6$ to demonstrate the contributions of FNSs and SNLs to one and two nonvanishing AHC components, respectively. We also investigate the tuning of AHC through symmetry breaking, outlining all possible symmetry-breaking pathways, and select the candidate material HoNi to demonstrate this approach by applying an external magnetic field. Additionally, we identify Berry curvature quadrupoles in the candidate materials, indicating that our strategy can be generalized to Berry curvature multipole effects. Our work will guide both the theoretical and experimental design of materials with large Berry curvature effects, with significant implications for a wide range of device applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resort to first-principles molecular dynamics, in synergy with experiments, to study structural evolution and Na$^+$ cation diffusion inside (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ (x = 0.10-0.40) glasses. Experimental and modeling results show a fair quantitative agreement in terms of total X-ray structure factors and pair distribution functions, thereby setting the ground for a comprehensive analysis of the glassy matrix evolution. We find that the structure of (TeO$_2$)$_{1-x}$-(Na$_2$O)$_{x}$ glasses deviates drastically from that of pure TeO$_2$ glass. Specifically, increasing the Na$_2$O concentration leads to a reduction of the coordination number of Te atoms, reflecting the occurrence of a structural depolymerization upon introduction of the Na$_2$O modifier oxide. The depolymerization phenomenon is ascribed to the transformation of Te-O-Te bridges into terminal Te-O non bridging oxygen atoms (NBO). Consequently, the concentration of NBO increases in these systems as the concentration of the modifier increases, accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the coordination number of Na atoms. The structure factors results show a prominent peak at 1.4 A, that becomes more and more pronounced as the Na2O concentration increases. The occurrence of this first sharp diffraction peak is attributed to the growth of Na-rich channels inside the amorphous network, acting as preferential routes for alkali-ion conduction inside the relatively stable Te-O matrix. These channels enhance the ion mobility.</description>

      <title>A planning tool for neutron powder diffraction experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computer program to simulate the results of neutron powder-diffraction experiments at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The program is freely available as a web application at http://addie.ornl.gov/hfirestimate, and is designed to be straightforward to use for researchers who are new to neutron diffraction. The input includes the crystal structure of the proposed sample, the sample mass, and the instrument configuration. The results include a plot of the simulated data -- including realistic estimates of background and the error bars due to counting statistics -- and suggestions of how to resolve potential problems with the experiment. Here, we explain the design and implementation of this program and demonstrate its performance using comparisons of simulated and experimental data. We hope that this program will enable researchers to plan neutron-scattering experiments more effectively, increasing the likelihood of successful experiments and improving the productivity of neutron-diffraction research.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Mediated Intrinsic Topological Superconductivity in Fermi Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that phonons can mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we demonstrate that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a wide range of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave superconductivity in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we show a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the arc, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</description>

      <title>Control of intervalley scattering in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ via temperature-dependent band renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of out-of-equilibrium electron dynamics in topological insulators is essential to unlock their potential in next-generation quantum technologies. However, the role of temperature on the renormalization of the electronic band structure and, consequently, on electron scattering processes is still elusive. Here, using high-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES), we show that even a modest ($\sim$15 meV) renormalization of the conduction band of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ can critically affect bulk and surface electron scattering processes. Supported by a kinetic Monte Carlo toy-model, we show that temperature-induced changes in the bulk band structure modulate the intervalley electron-phonon scattering rate, reshaping the out-of-equilibrium response. This work establishes temperature as an effective control knob for engineering scattering pathways in topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-optical measurements in La${}_{0.8}$Sr${}_{0.2}$NiO${}_2$ and Nd${}_{0.825}$Sr${}_{0.175}$NiO${}_2$ reveal an intriguing new facet of infinite-layer nickelate superconductors: the onset of spin-glass behavior at a temperature far exceeding the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$. This discovery sharply contrasts with copper oxide superconductors, where magnetism and superconductivity remain largely exclusive. Moreover, the magnitude and onset temperature of the polar Kerr effect in Nd${}_{0.825}$Sr${}_{0.175}$NiO${}_2$ fabricated on SrTiO${}_3$ and (LaAlO${}_3$)${}_{0.3}$(Sr${}_2$TaAlO${}_6$)${}_{0.7}$ substrates differ dramatically, while $T_c$ does not.</description>

      <title>Model for the Thermodynamics of Iron at High Pressures Near Melting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fe pressure-temperature phase diagram and its melting line have a wide range of applications, including providing constraints for iron-core planetary models. We propose an equation of state (EOS) model based on the interstitial theory of simple condensed matter (ITCM), as suggested by A.V. Granato. When applied to Fe, this model enables the extrapolation of measured melting lines to the conditions of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB). The ITCM describes the solid-liquid phase transition in metals as resulting from a strong structural perturbation due to a high concentration of interstitial-like defects. The strong nonlinearity of their self-interaction causes the stabilization of this interstitial-rich phase. The original model is expanded to describe melting over a wide range of pressures and temperatures rather than focusing on a specific isobaric transition. Using this model, we fit the measured melting data, extrapolate it to cover ICB conditions, and develop a multiphase equation of state that encompasses this regime. The model is used to explain contradictory data regarding the location of the melting line, resulting from a novel phase transition between two separate liquid phases, specifically between FCC-based and HCP-based liquids. This additional liquid phase offers a new interpretation of the previously suggested near-melting high-pressure phase and may also provide a solution to the inner core nucleation paradox.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ method on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a multi-GPU version of the quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QSGW), a cutting-edge method for describing electronic excitations in a first-principles approach. While the QSGW calculation algorithm is inherently well-suited for GPU computation due to its reliance on large-scale tensor operations, achieving a maintainable and extensible implementation is not straightforward. Addressing this, we have developed a GPU version within the \texttt{ecalj} package, utilizing module-based programming style in modern Fortran. This design facilitates future development and code sustainability. Following the summary of the QSGW formalism, we present our GPU implementation approach and the results of benchmark calculations for two types of systems to demonstrate the capability of our GPU-supported QSGW calculations.</description>

      <title>Direct laser ablation of 2D material films for fabricating multi-functional flexible and transparent devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for direct patterning of graphite and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) films on polycarbonate (PC) and other transparent substrates using fiber laser ablation. This process facilitates the fabrication of various functional devices, including strain gauges, supercapacitors, and photodetector arrays, without the need for photolithography or solvents, thereby simplifying device production and enhancing environmental sustainability. Utilizing roll-to-roll mechanical exfoliation, homogeneous nanosheet films are created and then patterned with a laser engraving system. Electrical and optical characterization confirms that the laser-processed films maintain their crystallinity, with no observable damage to the underlying substrate. We demonstrate the scalability of this approach by constructing a WSe2/graphite photodetector array on PC, which exhibits high sensitivity, low noise, and uniform photocurrent response across its active channels. As a proof-of-concept, this array is used as an image sensor to capture light patterns, showcasing its potential for flexible and semi-transparent imaging applications. These findings open up new avenues for incorporating all-van der Waals devices into wearable electronics, optoelectronics, and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations on Nuclear Recoils in Silicon Crystals towards Single Electron-Hole Pair Ionization Yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a novel methodology utilizing molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate the ionization yields of nuclear recoils in crystalline silicon. This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.</description>

      <title>HTSC-2025: A Benchmark Dataset of Ambient-Pressure High-Temperature Superconductors for AI-Driven Critical Temperature Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconducting materials holds great significance for human industry and daily life. In recent years, research on predicting superconducting transition temperatures using artificial intelligence~(AI) has gained popularity, with most of these tools claiming to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the lack of widely accepted benchmark datasets in this field has severely hindered fair comparisons between different AI algorithms and impeded further advancement of these methods. In this work, we present the HTSC-2025, an ambient-pressure high-temperature superconducting benchmark dataset. This comprehensive compilation encompasses theoretically predicted superconducting materials discovered by theoretical physicists from 2023 to 2025 based on BCS superconductivity theory, including the renowned X$_2$YH$_6$ system, perovskite MXH$_3$ system, M$_3$XH$_8$ system, cage-like BCN-doped metal atomic systems derived from LaH$_{10}$ structural evolution, and two-dimensional honeycomb-structured systems evolving from MgB$_2$. The HTSC-2025 benchmark has been open-sourced at https://github.com/xqh19970407/HTSC-2025 and will be continuously updated. This benchmark holds significant importance for accelerating the discovery of superconducting materials using AI-based methods.</description>

      <title>Note on the interpretation of magnetic diffraction in NdAlSi: helical or fan?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the magnetic structure analysis reported in Nat. Mater. 20, 1650 (2021), which concluded that a Weyl semimetal candidate NdAlSi hosts a helical magnetic order. This conclusion was based on magnetic neutron diffraction peaks corresponding to modulation vectors $\vec{k}_{in} = (1/3, 1/3, 0)$ and $\vec{k}_{out} = (2/3, 2/3, 0)$, attributed to in-plane and out-of-plane components of the magnetic moments, respectively. Upon careful reanalysis, we suggest that a fan-type magnetic structure--rather than the helix--provides a more consistent interpretation of these data. Unlike a helical structure, fan structures do not exhibit handedness. The distinction has significant implications for interpreting the electromagnetic responses in this material. We believe that our suggestions motivate a re-examination of magnetic structures in NdAlSi and other tetragonal siblings, where the interplay between magnetism and topology is under active investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Chemistry and MaxCut: Classical Performance Guarantees and Quantum Algorithms for the Hartree-Fock Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum chemistry, self-consistent field (SCF) algorithms define a nonlinear optimization problem, with both continuous and discrete components. In this work, we derive Hartree-Fock-inspired SCF algorithms that can be exactly written as a sequence of Quadratic Unconstrained Spin/Binary Optimization problems (QUSO/QUBO). We reformulate the optimization problem as a series of MaxCut graph problems, which can be efficiently solved using semi-definite programming techniques. This procedure provides performance guarantees at each SCF step, irrespective of the complexity of the optimization landscape. We numerically demonstrate the QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF methods by studying the hydroxide anion OH- and molecular Nitrogen N2. The largest problem addressed in this study involves a system comprised of 220 qubits (equivalently, spin-orbitals). Our results show that QUBO-SCF and MaxCut-SCF suffer much less from internal instabilities compared with conventional SCF calculations. Additionally, we show that the new SCF algorithms can enhance single-reference methods, such as configuration interaction. Finally, we explore how quantum algorithms for optimization can be applied to the QUSO problems arising from the Hartree-Fock method. Four distinct hybrid-quantum classical approaches are introduced: GAS-SCF, QAOA-SCF, QA-SCF and DQI-SCF.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of $E'_\gamma$ Defect Generation in Ionizing-irradiated $a$-SiO$_2$: The Nonradiative Carrier Capture-Structural Relaxation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total ionizing dose (TID) effect of semiconductor devices stems from radiation-induced $E'_\gamma$ defects in the $a$-SiO$_2$ dielectrics, but the conventional ``hole transport-trapping'' model of defect generation fails to explain recent basic experiments. Here, we propose an essentially new ``nonradiative carrier capture-structural relaxation'' (NCCSR) mechanism that can consistently explain the puzzling temperature/electric-field dependence, based on spin-polarized HSE06 hybrid functional calculations and existing experimental alignment of defect formation energies and charge capture cross-sections of large-sample oxygen vacancies in $a$-SiO$_2$. It is revealed that, the long-assumed $V_{O\gamma}$ precursors with high formation energy cannot survive in high temperature-grown $a$-SiO$_2$; whereas the stable $V_{O\delta}$ can capture irradiation-induced holes via strong electron-phonon coupling, generating metastable $E'_\delta$ that most relax into stable $E'_\gamma$. A fractional power-law (FPL) dynamic model is derived based on the mechanism and the Kohlrausch-Williams Watts (KWW) decay function. It can uniformly describe nonlinear data over a wide dose and temperature range. This work not only provides a solid cornerstone for prediction and hardening of TID effects of SiO$_2$-based semiconductor devices, but also offers a general approach for studying ionizing radiation physics in alternative dielectrics with intrinsic electronic metastability and dispersion.</description>

Abstract: Grain growth in polycrystals is traditionally considered a capillarity-driven process, where grain boundaries (GBs) migrate toward their centers of curvature (i.e., mean curvature flow) with a velocity proportional to the local curvature (including extensions to account for anisotropic GB energy and mobility). Experimental and simulation evidence shows that this simplistic view is untrue. We demonstrate that the failure of the classical mean curvature flow description of grain growth mainly originates from the shear deformation naturally coupled with GB motion (i.e., shear coupling). Our findings are built on large-scale microstructure evolution simulations incorporating the fundamental (crystallography-respecting) microscopic mechanism of GB migration. The nature of the deviations from curvature flow revealed in our simulations is consistent with observations in recent experimental studies on different materials. This work also demonstrates how to incorporate the mechanical effects that are essential to the accurate prediction of microstructure evolution.</description>

      <title>Wyckoff Transformer: Generation of Symmetric Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays a fundamental role in determining its physical, chemical, and electronic properties such as electrical and thermal conductivity, optical and polarization behavior, and mechanical strength. Almost all known crystalline materials have internal symmetry. However, this is often inadequately addressed by existing generative models, making the consistent generation of stable and symmetrically valid crystal structures a significant challenge. We introduce WyFormer, a generative model that directly tackles this by formally conditioning on space group symmetry. It achieves this by using Wyckoff positions as the basis for an elegant, compressed, and discrete structure representation. To model the distribution, we develop a permutation-invariant autoregressive model based on the Transformer encoder and an absence of positional encoding. Extensive experimentation demonstrates WyFormer's compelling combination of attributes: it achieves best-in-class symmetry-conditioned generation, incorporates a physics-motivated inductive bias, produces structures with competitive stability, predicts material properties with competitive accuracy even without atomic coordinates, and exhibits unparalleled inference speed.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for industrial applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that, due to their symmetry which depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe bilayers (Te-Mn-Te-Mn-Te) as candidate devices, with the help of symmetry analysis, first-principles calculations, and magnetic dynamics simulations. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Is Triboelectricity Confusing, Confused or Complex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we look at the fundamental physics of triboelectricity, charge transfer due to contact and sliding. While much of the report focuses upon recent advances such as the incorporation of flexoelectric contributions, we also include older work, some from centuries ago, which only now can be understood in a general sense. Basic concepts and theories ranging from elements of tribology and contact mechanics through semiconductor built-in potentials, electromechanical terms, mechanochemistry and trap states are briefly described, linking to established surface science and interface physics. We then overview the main models that have been proposed, showing that they all fall within conventional electrostatics combined with other established science. We conclude with some suggestions for the future. Based upon this overview, our conclusion is that triboelectricity is a slightly complex combination of standard electrostatic phenomena that can be understood using the generalized Ampere's law connecting the electric displacement field with both Coulomb and polarization contributions, and the free carrier density, that is Grad.D=rho. Triboelectricity may be confusing, it is not really confused if care is taken, but it is complex.</description>

      <title>Superzone gap formation induced by ferroic orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a superzone gap, typically associated with antiferroic ordering, can also emerge from ferroic orders in systems with sublattice degrees of freedom. By analyzing a $p$-orbital tight-binding model on a zigzag chain, we show that a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger-type gap is induced by ferroquadrupolar or ferromagnetic order or by applying an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Computational Physics in the Advanced Lab: Experiment and Simulation of Thermal Diffusion in Metal Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple experiment on thermal diffusion in metal rods that can be used to integrate computation into the advanced lab. An analytical solution exists for the transient heat conduction in an infinite rod with a delta function heat input, but no analytical solution exists for short rods or for long duration heat inputs. Our apparatus is a copper rod with a heater and thermometers attached to the rod. The temperature of the metal rod due to transient heat conduction can be modeled using a simple numerical simulation and the finite centered difference method. Using a 22 cm long copper rod with the ends thermally sunk in aluminum blocks, we show poor agreement between the experimental results and the infinite-rod analytical model, but excellent agreement between the experimental results and our numerical simulation. This experiment shows the power of a numerical simulation but also the limitations of the chosen model, which can be used as motivation for further exploration.</description>
