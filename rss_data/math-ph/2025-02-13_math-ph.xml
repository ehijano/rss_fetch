      <title>Higher-order continuum models for twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order continuum PDE model proposed by Bistritzer and MacDonald in \cite{bistritzer2011moire} accurately describes the single-particle electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at small twist angles. In this paper, we obtain higher-order corrections to the Bistritzer-MacDonald model via a systematic multiple-scales expansion. We prove that the solution of the resulting higher-order PDE model accurately approximates the corresponding tight-binding wave function under a natural choice of parameters and given initial conditions that are spectrally localized to the monolayer Dirac points. Numerical simulations of tight-binding and continuum dynamics demonstrate the validity of the higher-order continuum model. Symmetries of the higher-order models are also discussed. This work extends the analysis from \cite{watson2023bistritzer}, which rigorously established the validity of the (first-order) BM model.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstruction is absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalization. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Test particles in Kaluza-Klein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09503v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geodesics in general relativity describe the behaviour of test particles in a gravitational field. In 5D Kaluza-Klein, geodesics reproduce the Lorentz force motion of particles in an electromagnetic field. This paper studies geodesic motion on a higher-dimensional $M_4 \times K$ with background metrics encoding general 4D gauge fields and Higgs-like scalars. It shows that the classical mass and charge of a test particle become variable quantities when the geodesic traverses regions of spacetime with massive gauge fields, such as the weak force field, or with non-constant Higgs scalars. This agrees with the physical fact that interactions mediated by massive bosons can change the mass and charge of particles. The variation rates of mass and charge along a geodesic are given by natural geometric formulae. In regions where mass is preserved, there are additional constants of motion, one for every abelian or simple summand in the Killing algebra of $K$. The last part of the paper discusses traditional difficulties of Kaluza-Klein models, such as the low $q / m$ ratios in the 5D model. It suggests possible ways to circumvent them. It also remarks the naturalness of a model in which elementary particles always travel at the speed of light in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of traveling wave solutions in the fractional Rosenau-Hyman equation via homotopy perturbation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the homotopy perturbation method to construct series solutions for the fractional Rosenau-Hyman (fRH) equation and study their dynamics. Unlike the classical RH equation where compactons arise from truncated periodic solutions, we show that spatial nonlocality prevents the existence of compactons, and therefore periodic traveling waves are considered. By asymptotic analyses involving the Mittag-Leffler function, it is shown that the quadratic fRH equation exhibits bifurcation with respect to the order of the temporal fractional derivative, leading to the eventual pinning of wave propagation. Additionally, numerical results suggest potential finite time blow-up in the cubic fRH. While HPM proves effective in constructing analytic solutions, we identify cases of divergence, underscoring the need for further research into its convergence properties and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Cut-off phenomenon and asymptotic mixing for multivariate general linear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The small noise cut-off phenomenon in continuous time and space has been studied in the recent literature for the linear and non-linear stable Langevin dynamics with additive L\'evy drivers - understood as abrupt thermalization of the system along a particular time scale to its dynamical equilibrium - both for the total variation distance and the Wasserstein distance. The main result of this article establishes sufficient conditions for the window and profile cut-off phenomenon, which are flexible enough to cover the renormalized (non-Markovian) Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process driven by fractional Brownian motion and a large class of Gaussian and non-Gaussian, homogeneous and non-homogeneous drivers with (possible) finite second moments. The sufficient conditions are stated both for the total variation distance and the Wasserstein distance. Important examples are the multidimensional fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, the empirical sampling process of a fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck processes driven by an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process and the inhomogeneous Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process arising in simulated annealing.</description>

      <title>On a coupled system of KP-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defining characteristic of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili (KP) model equations is that the well-posedness results are subject to the restriction that at all transverse positions, the mass $\int u \,dx = \text{constant independent of $y$}.$ In 2007, for a rather general class of equations of KP type, it was shown that the zero-mass (in $x$) constraint is satisfied at any non-zero time even if it is not satisfied at initial time zero. In an effort to remedy this "odd" behavior of the mass of a given solution to the KP Cauchy problem, a model modification is introduced which does not impose non-physical restrictions upon the initial data. In this article, we introduce a new modified KP system. After providing a variational derivation of the model, we analyze its Hamiltonian evolutionary structure. Furthermore, we prove linear estimates in the Bourgain spaces $X^{s,b}$ corresponding to the integral equation arising from the Duhamel formulation of system.</description>

      <title>Moment estimates for polyatomic Boltzmann equation with frozen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a polyatomic gas with continuous internal energy is considered, allowing for frozen collisions, in which the kinetic energy of the colliding particle pair is conserved, and the internal energy of each particle remains unchanged. A priori moment estimates are derived for solutions of the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation with a collision kernel of the hard potentials type with cut-off. The model with frozen collisions is first analyzed, followed by a review of general collisions--referred to as pure polyatomic--which preserve the total kinetic and internal energy. By combining existing results for pure polyatomic collisions with the newly derived estimates for frozen collisions, moment estimates are established for the Boltzmann equation with a collision operator that convexly combines both types of collisions. In particular, the moment generation property is shown to be driven by the rate of the pure polyatomic operator, and the moment propagation property holds.</description>

      <title>Generalized synchronization in the presence of dynamical noise and its detection via recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two unidirectionally coupled nonlinear systems, we speak of generalized synchronization when the responder \textquotedblleft follows\textquotedblright\ the driver. Mathematically, this situation is implemented by a map from the driver state space to the responder state space termed the synchronization map. In nonlinear times series analysis, the framework of the present work, the existence of the synchronization map amounts to the invertibility of the so-called cross map, which is a continuous map that exists in the reconstructed state spaces for typical time-delay embeddings. The cross map plays a central role in some techniques to detect functional dependencies between time series. In this paper, we study the changes in the \textquotedblleft noiseless scenario\textquotedblright\ just described when noise is present in the driver, a more realistic situation that we call the \textquotedblleft noisy scenario\textquotedblright . Noise will be modeled using a family of driving dynamics indexed by a finite number of parameters, which is sufficiently general for practical purposes. In this approach, it turns out that the cross and synchronization maps can be extended to the noisy scenario as families of maps that depend on the noise parameters, and only for \textquotedblleft generic\textquotedblright\ driver states in the case of the cross map. To reveal generalized synchronization in both the noiseless and noisy scenarios, we check the existence of synchronization maps of higher periods (introduced in this paper) using recurrent neural networks and predictability. The results obtained with synthetic and real world data demonstrate the capability of our method.</description>

      <title>Stability of N-front and N-back solutions in the Barkley model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish for an intermediate Reynolds number domain the stability of N-front and N-back solutions for each N &gt; 1 corresponding to traveling waves, in an experimentally validated model for the transition to turbulence in pipe flow proposed in [Barkley et al., Nature 526(7574):550-553, 2015]. We base our work on the existence analysis of a heteroclinic loop between a turbulent and a laminar equilibrium proved by Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022], as well as some results from this work. The stability proof follows the verification of a set of abstract stability hypotheses stated by Sandstede in [SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis 29.1 (1998), pp. 183-207] for traveling waves motivated by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. In particular, this completes the first detailed analysis of Engel, Kuehn and de Rijk in [Engel, Kuehn, de Rijk, Nonlinearity 35:5903, 2022] leading to a complete existence and stability statement that nicely fits within the abstract framework of waves generated by twisted heteroclinic loops.</description>

      <title>All Hilbert spaces are the same: consequences for generalized coordinates and momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making use of the simple fact that all separable complex Hilbert spaces of given dimension are isomorphic, we show that there are just six basic ways to define generalized coordinate operators in Quantum Mechanics. In each case a canonically conjugate generalized momentum operator can be defined, but it may not be self-adjoint. Even in those cases we show there is always either a self-adjoint extension of the operator or a Neumark extension of the Hilbert space that produces a self-adjoint momentum operator. In one of the six cases both extensions work, thus leading to seven basic pairs of coordinate and momentum operators. We also show why there are more ways of defining basic coordinate and momentum measurements. A special role is reserved for measurements that simultaneously measure both.</description>

      <title>Interacting Particle Systems Modeling Self-Propelled Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-equilibrium statistical physics, active matters in both living and non-living systems have been extensively studied. In particular, self-propelled particle systems provide challenging research subjects in experimental and theoretical physics, since individual and collective behaviors of units performing persistent motions can not be described by usual fluctuation theory for equilibrium systems. A typical example of man-made self-propelled systems which can be easily handled in small-sized experiments is a system of camphor floats put on the surface of water. Based on the experimental and theoretical studied by Nishimori et al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 86 (2017) 101012), we propose a new type of mathematical models for complex motions of camphor disks on the surface of water. In the previous mathematical models introduced by Nishimori et al. are coupled systems of the equations of motion for camphor disks described by ordinary differential equations and the partial differential equation for the concentration field of camphor molecules in water. Here we consider coupled systems of equation of motions of camphor disks and random walks representing individual camphor molecules in water. In other words, we take into account non-equilibrium fluctuations by introducing stochastic processes into the deterministic models. Numerical simulation shows that our models can represent self-propelled motions of individual camphor disk as well as repulsive interactions among them. We focus on the one-dimensional models in which viscosity is dominant, and derive a dynamical system of a camphor disk by taking the average of random variables of our stochastic system. By studying both of stochastic models and dynamical systems, we clarify the transitions between three phases of motions for a camphor disk depending on parameters.</description>

      <title>A continuum limit for dense spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical systems, such as optical waveguide lattices and dense neuronal or vascular networks, can be modeled by metric graphs, where slender "wires" (edges) support wave or diffusion equations subject to Kirchhoff boundary conditions at the nodes. This work proposes a continuum-limit framework that replaces discrete vertex-based equations with a coarse-grained partial differential equation (PDE) defined on the continuous space occupied by the network. The derivation naturally introduces an edge-conductivity tensor, an edge-capacity function, and a vertex number density to encode how each microscopic patch of the graph contributes to the macroscopic phenomena. The results have interesting similarities and differences with the Riemannian Laplace-Beltrami operator. We calculate all macroscopic parameters from first principles via a systematic discrete-to-continuous local homogenization, finding an anomalous effective embedding dimension resulting from a homogenized diffusivity. Numerical examples, including an axisymmetric "spiderweb", several periodic lattices, random Delaunay triangulations, nearest-neighbor geometric graphs, and aperiodic monotiles, demonstrate that each finite model converges to its corresponding PDE (posed on different manifolds like tori, disks, and spheres) in the limit of increasing vertex density.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of boundary spin correlations in non-integrable Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of non-integrable 2D Ising models obtained by perturbing the nearest-neighbor model via a weak, finite range potential which preserves translation and spin-flip symmetry, and we study its critical theory in the half-plane. We prove that the leading order long-distance behavior of the correlation functions for spins on the boundary is the same as for the nearest-neighbor model, up to an analytic multiplicative renormalization constant. In particular, the scaling limit is the Pfaffian of an explicit matrix. The proof is based on an exact representation of the generating function of correlations in terms of a Grassmann integral and on a multiscale analysis thereof, generalizing previous results to include observables located on the boundary.</description>

Abstract: We consider a variational approach to the Bose-Hubbard model based on Bogoliubov theory. We introduce the grand canonical and canonical free energy functionals for which we prove the existence of the minimizers. By analyzing their structure we show the existence of a superfluid phase at sufficiently low temperatures. In particular, we show that this model does not exhibit a quantum phase transition.</description>

Abstract: The problem of finding superintegrable Hamiltonians and their integrals of motion can be reduced to solving a series of compatibility equations that result from the overdetermination of the commutator or Poisson bracket relations. The computation of the compatibility equations requires a general formula for the coefficients, which in turn must depend on the potential to be solved for. This is in general a nonlinear problem and quite difficult. Thus, research has focused on dividing the classes of potential into standard and exotic ones so that a number of parameters may be set to zero and the coefficients may be obtained in a simpler setting. We have developed a new method in both the classical and quantum setting which readily yields a formula for the coefficients of the invariant without recourse to this division in the case of Cartesian-separable Hamiltonians. Even though they allow separation of variables as they in general involve potential in terms of higher transcendental and beyond hypergeometric for their wavefunctions, they are quite non-trivial models. The expressions we obtain are in general non-polynomial in the momenta whose fractional terms can be arbitrarily set to zero. These conditions are equivalent to the compatibility equations, but the only unknowns in addition to the potential are constant parameters. We also give the fourth-order standard potentials, and conjectures about general families.</description>

      <title>Regge symmetry of 6j-symbols of the Lorentz group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive new symmetry and new expression for $6j$-symbols of the unitary principle series representations of the $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ group. This allowed us to derive for them the analogue of the Regge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Reality conditions for sine-Gordon equation and quasi-periodic solutions in finite phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic solutions of the sine-Gordon equation are expressed in terms of $\wp_{1,2g-1}$-function, and reality conditions are completely determined. This new result
  leads to computation and graphical representation of non-linear wave solutions. A way of obtaining finite-gap solutions by means of algebro-geometric integration is exposed in detail, as well as the construction of the sine-Gordon hierarchy on coadjoint orbits of the loop group of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs and Yang-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Ferri and Sciandra introduced two equivalent algebraic structures, matched pair of actions on an arbitrary Hopf algebra and Yetter-Drinfeld brace. In fact, they equivalently produce braiding operators on Hopf algebras satisfying the braid equation, thus generalize the construction of Yang-Baxter operators by Lu, Yan and Zhu from braiding operators on groups, and also by Angiono, Galindo and Vendramin from cocommutative Hopf braces. In this paper, we provide equivalence conditions for such kind of Yang-Baxter operators to be involutive. Particularly, we give a positive answer for an open problem raised by Ferri and Sciandra, namely, a matched pair of actions on a Hopf algebra $H$ induces an involutive Yang-Baxter operator if and only if its intrinsic Hopf algebra $H_\rightharpoonup$ in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $H$ is braided commutative. Also, we show that the double cross product $H\bowtie H$ is a Hopf algebra with a projection and $H_\rightharpoonup$ serves as its subalgebra of coinvariants. As an illustration, we use a simplified characterization to classify matched pairs of actions on the 8-dimensional non-semisimple Hopf algebra $A_{C_2\times C_2}$ and analyze the associated Yang-Baxter operators to find that they are all involutive.</description>

      <title>Partition Function Zeros of Paths and Normalization Zeros of ASEPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the equivalence between the partition function of an adsorbing Dyck walk model and the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP) normalization to obtain the thermodynamic limit of the locus of the ASEP normalization zeros from a conformal map. We discuss the equivalence between this approach and using an electrostatic analogy to determine the locus, both in the case of the ASEP and the random allocation model.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Shehsmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed.</description>
