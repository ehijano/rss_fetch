      <title>Simple molecules and complex chemistry in a protoplanetary disk: A JWST investigation of the highly inclined disk d216-0939</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the number of detected molecules, particularly complex organic molecules, in the solid-state in astrophysical environments is still rather limited, laboratory experiments and astrochemical models predict many potential candidates. Detection of molecules in protoplanetary disks provides a bridge between the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium and the chemistry of planets and their atmospheres. The excellent spectral sensitivity, broad wavelength coverage and high spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allows for making progress in exploring chemical compositions of various astrophysical environments including planet-forming disks. They are a prerequisite for probing the disk content by means of sensitive absorption studies. In this paper, we present initial results of the JWST Cycle 1 GO program 1741 on d216-0939, a highly inclined TTauri disk located in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster. We utilise the NIRSpec and MIRI integral field unit spectrographs to cover its spectrum from 1.7 to 28~$\mu$m. In the d216-0939 disk, we give assignments of the composition of silicate grains. We unambiguously detect solid-state features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, CO, OCN$^-$, and tentatively OCS; species that had been detected recently also in other circumstellar disks. For the first time in disks, we provide unique detections of ices carrying NH$_4^+$ and the complex organic molecule ammonium carbamate (NH$_4^+$NH$_2$COO$^-$). The latter detections speak for a very efficient NH$_3$ chemistry in the disk. We also show the very important role of scattering in the analysis of observational spectra of highly inclined disks.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Magnetic Pressure-Driven YSO Jets in the Polar Cavity from Toroidal Fields Generated by Inner Disk Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are commonly observed in young stellar objects (YSOs), yet their origins remain debated. Using 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a circumstellar disk threaded by a large-scale open poloidal magnetic field, we identify three components in the disk-driven outflow: (1) a fast, collimated jet, (2) a less collimated, slower laminar disk wind, and (3) a magneto-rotational instability (MRI)-active disk wind that separates the former two. At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with the laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct components. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven primarily by toroidal magnetic pressure in the low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric analysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does not contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as the dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with the classical magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the accreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration. In particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for magneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge the applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from steady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the jet's launching radius. For the slower disk wind, vertical motion is primarily driven by toroidal magnetic pressure, while centrifugal forces widen the wind's opening angle near its base.</description>

      <title>Orbital inclination of astrometric binaries and the dearth of face-on orbits in Gaia DR3 solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital solutions for astrometric (unresolved) binary stars provided in the Gaia mission Data Release 3 reveal an obvious deficit of face-on orbits with line-of-sight inclinations close to 0 or $\pi$. This is shown to be an intrinsic mathematical feature of the orbit estimation technique involving the intermediate Thiele-Innes parameters, which are transformed to the Campbell geometric parameters. A direct condition equation defining the inclination angle via the Thiele-Innes values independently of the other orbital elements is used to investigate the origin of this near-degeneracy for face-on orbits. The emerging bias and correlation of inclination and semimajor axis are illustrated using Monte Carlo simulations for two specific template configurations representing face-on and edge-on orbits. The results have significant impact on the interpretation and follow-up confirmation of Gaia-detected binary systems, including candidate exoplanets and brown dwarf companions.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsators in eclipsing binaries: oscillating eclipsing Algols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing double-lined spectroscopic binaries hosting $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsators offer a unique laboratory for simultaneously constraining stellar geometry and interior structure. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of five oscillating eclipsing Algol binaries. By combining high-precision, short-cadence TESS photometry with multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive precise stellar and orbital parameters. Frequency power spectra were obtained using residuals from binary modelling. We further investigate the evolutionary history of these systems using a grid of MESA binary evolution simulations. Our analysis suggests that the systems must have undergone either case A or case B mass transfer, with the primary components repositioned in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and now pulsating in the $\delta$ Scuti regime, while the cooler secondaries are underluminous and inflated, filling their Roche lobes. This study contributes to the growing catalog of well-characterised oEA systems and our understanding of the effects of mass-transfer on the fate of these short-period binaries.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Coronal Hole and Quiet Sun Chromosphere Using IRIS Mg II h &amp; k Observations of Polar Off-limb Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar quiet regions are divided into coronal hole regions (CH) and quiet-Sun regions (QS). The global magnetic field in CH is considered open to interplanetary space, while that in QS is closed. To constrain the solar atmosphere and solar wind model, we statistically compared CH and QS in the chromosphere by quantitatively analyzing all available high-resolution spectral data sets of polar off-limb regions taken from the entire catalog of IRIS (Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph) satellite. We extracted the characteristic quantities from the Mg II h and k line profiles and compared the dependence of those quantities on the height from the photospheric limb. The main findings are as follows. First, the integrated intensities in the Mg II k line show a steeper decrease with height in QS while they remain bright at higher altitudes in CH. Second, the unsigned line-of-sight velocities in the Mg II k line generally increase with height in both regions, although the unsigned velocities in QS increase with height stronger than CH. Third, the Mg II k line widths increase just above the limb and then decrease with height in both CH and QS but are overall larger for CH than for QS, especially at the lower altitudes. Finally, we found the ratio of the Mg II k and h lines to show a two-step increase with height in both regions. The results suggest the CH spicules are higher, and the CH chromosphere exhibits faster motions than the QS.</description>

      <title>Binary Parameters for the Recurrent Nova T Coronae Borealis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T CrB is among the brightest novae. It is recurrent with outbursts happening approximately every 80 years. The next outburst is imminent, expected in 2025. The T CrB binary consists of an M4 III red giant (RG) secondary and a white dwarf (WD) primary. A time series of spectra of the RG was obtained between 2022 and 2024. Radial velocities (RVs) from these data were combined with literature RVs and an updated orbit computed. The orbit is circular to a high precision and has a period of 227.5494 +/- 0.0049 days for the circular solution. An eccentric solution yields an eccentricity of 0.0072 +/- 0.0026. Rotational line broadening of the RG was also measured. Binary parameters are derived by maximum likelihood modeling of the available observational data. The WD, in accord with other estimates for recurrent novae, is massive. Assuming the Gaia distance, the WD mass is 1.37 +/- 0.01 M sun with the M giant secondary mass 0.69 +0.02/-0.01 M sun. We discuss the evolution of this system and both paths to and limitations on further refining the values of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Color-Magnitude Relation of M Giants by Using Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M giants, with their distinctive properties such as high luminosity, serve as excellent indicators for mapping the structure of the Milky Way. The distance to distant M giants can be determined by using the color-magnitude relation (CMR), which is derived from color-magnitude diagrams of specific systems in previous studies. In this work, we aimed to achieve more accurate distance determination for M giants by focusing on open clusters (OCs) with a large number of member stars and thus improve the CMR. For the first time, we compiled a census of OCs harboring M giants using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 9. We identified 58 M giants associated with 43 OCs and obtained their astrometric and photometric parameters from Gaia DR3. Using the distances of these OCs, we derived the CMR for M giants as a linear correlation, expressed as $M_{Ks}=3.85-8.26(J-K_s$). This linear relation proved superior to the empirical distance relation in characterizing the CMR of M giants. The photometric distances of M giants derived from the CMR are consistent with the parallax distances from Gaia and known spectroscopic distances, with median deviations of 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Using the distances of M giants derived from the CMR, we computed their radial velocity ($V_R$), azimuthal velocity ($V{\phi}$), and vertical velocity ($V_Z$), respectively. The distributions of these velocities revealed key features of the Galactic disk, including oscillation, north-south rotational asymmetry, and warp. These findings are consistent with previous studies and further validate the reliability of the derived CMR.</description>

      <title>New submillimetre HCN lasers in carbon-rich evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong laser emission from hydrogen cyanide (HCN) at 805 and 891 GHz has been discovered towards carbon-rich (C-rich) AGB stars, originating from the Coriolis-coupled system between two (1,1^{1e},0) and (0,4^0,0) vibrational states. However, other lines (at 894, 964, 968 and 1055 GHz) in this system remained unexplored due to observational challenges. Using SOFIA/4GREAT observations and Herschel/HIFI archival data, we analyzed the six HCN transitions in eight C-rich AGB stars. We report new HCN transitions show laser action at 964, 968, and 1055 GHz. The 805, 891, and 964 GHz lasers were detected in seven C-rich stars, the 968 GHz laser in six, and the 1055 GHz laser in five, while the 894 GHz line was not detected in any target. Among the detected lasers, the 891 GHz laser is always the strongest, and the 964 GHz laser, like a twin of the 891 GHz line, is the second strongest. Towards IRC+10216, all five HCN laser transitions were observed in six to eight epochs and exhibited significant variations in line profiles and intensities. The cross-ladder lines at 891 and 964 GHz exhibit similar variations, and their intensity changes do not follow the near-infrared light curve (i.e. non-periodic variations). In contrast, the variations of the rotational lines at 805, 968, and 1055 GHz appear to be quasi-periodic, with a phase lag of 0.1 - 0.2 relative to the near-infrared light curve. A comparative analysis indicates that these HCN lasers may be seen as analogues to vibrationally excited SiO and water masers in oxygen-rich stars. We suggest chemical pumping and radiative pumping could play an important role in the production of the cross-ladder HCN lasers, while the quasi-periodic behavior of the rotational HCN laser lines may be modulated by additional collisional and radiative pumping driven by periodic shocks and variations in infrared luminosity.

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation III. Fast rotators and new FGK stars in the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next mission dedicated to the study of planetary atmospheres is the Ariel space mission, planned for launch in 2029, which will observe a variety of planetary systems belonging to different classes around stars with spectral types from M to A. To optimise the scientific outcome of the mission, such stars need to be homogeneously characterised beforehand. In this work, we focus on a methodology based on spectral synthesis for the characterisation of FGK-type stars from the Ariel Tier 1 Mission Candidate Sample (MCS) which exhibit fast rotation. In addition, we analyse slow-rotating FGK-type stars, with either new observations or archival spectra available, consistently as in our previous work using the equivalent width (EW) analysis. To ensure consistency between our methods, we re-analysed a sample of FGK-type stars with the spectral synthesis method and compared it to our previous work. The results of our analysis show excellent agreement with the previous set of derived parameters. We also computed their orbital parameters establishing whether they belong to the Galactic thin or thick discs. With the current set of stellar parameters, we almost double the analysed hosts in the Ariel MCS to 353 stars in total. Using our homogeneous set of stellar parameters, we studied the correlations between stellar and planetary properties for the Ariel MCS analysed so far. We confirmed a close relationship between stellar mass (up to 1.8 solar masses) and giant planet radius, with more inflated planets at lower metallicity. We confirm that giant planets are more frequent around more metal-rich stars that belong to the thin disc, while lower-mass planets are also found in more metal-poor environments, and are more frequent than giant planets in the thick disc as also seen in other works in the literature.</description>

      <title>Tracing Chemical Depletion in Evolved Binaries Hosting Second-Generation Transition Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms responsible for chemical depletion across diverse astrophysical environments are not yet fully understood. In this paper, we investigate chemical depletion in post-AGB/post-RGB binary stars hosting second-generation transition discs using high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT. We performed a detailed chemical abundance analysis of 6 post-AGB/post-RGB stars and 6 post-AGB/post-RGB candidates with transition discs in the Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances were obtained through 1D LTE analysis of chemical elements from C to Eu, and 1D NLTE corrections were incorporated for elements from C to Fe. Our results confirmed that depletion efficiency, traced by the [S/Ti] abundance ratio, is higher in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs compared to the overall sample of post-AGB/post-RGB binaries. We also examined correlations between derived abundances and binary system parameters (astrometric, photometric, orbital, pulsational). Additionally, we compared the depletion patterns in our sample to those observed in young stars with transition discs and in the interstellar medium. We confirmed that the depletion is significantly stronger in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs than in young stars with transition discs. Furthermore, we found that [X/Zn] abundance ratio trends of volatile and refractory elements in post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with transition discs generally resemble similar trends in the interstellar medium (except for trends of [Si/Zn] and [Mg/Zn] ratios). These findings, although based on a limited sample, provide indirect constraints for depletion mechanism in circumbinary discs around post-AGB/post-RGB stars.</description>

      <title>Observations of UX Ori in deep minima with the Nordic Optical Telescope. I. Analysis of spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UX Orionis stars are the most active young stars; they undergo sporadic fadings of 2 - 4 magnitudes in the V-band, due to variable circumstellar extinction caused by a nearly edge-on star-disc system. The long-lasting monitoring of a number of stars of this type with the Nordic Optical Telescope from 2019 to 2024 has given a rich collection of material of high-resolution (R ~ 25000) spectra obtained during different brightness states of the stars. In this paper, we present the results of observations for UX Ori itself. Until now only one spectrum of high resolution had been obtained for this star during brightness minimum, making it difficult to do a comprehensive analysis. Our aim is to analyse how different spectral lines change during such irregular fading events, when the star is going in and out of eclipses, obscured by dust along the line of sight. For this purpose we provide a comparative analysis of the profiles and equivalent widths of the spectral lines belonging to the different atoms and ions. In addition we compare the results for UX Ori with those made for another target in our sample: RR Tau. Common features of variability are revealed: 1) a strengthening of the H-alpha line relatively to the continuum during eclipses; 2) the appearance of additional emission on the frequencies of photospheric lines (e.g. Fe II, Ca II, Si II). The different behaviour of the spectral lines during fading found for UX Ori and RR Tau may be caused by two effects: a different contribution of the scattered light to the stellar flux during eclipses or a less intense disc wind of UX Ori.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Study of the Enigmatic Mid-Infrared Rings in the Planetary Nebula NGC 1514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While NGC 1514 is an elliptical, but complex, planetary nebula at optical wavelengths, it was discovered to have a pair of infrared-bright, axisymmetric rings contained within its faint outer shell during the course of the WISE all-sky survey. We have obtained JWST mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of the nebula through the use of simultaneous observations with the MIRI Imager and Medium Resolution Spectrometer, selecting the F770W, F1280W, and F2550W filters to match each of the MRS's three grating positions. These observations show that the rings are clearly resolved and relatively distinct structures, with both filamentary and clumpy detail throughout. There is also cloud-like material that has a turbulent appearance in the interior of the rings, particularly at the longest wavelengths, and faint ejecta-like structures just outside the ring boundaries. Despite their brightness, the emission from the rings within the three imager passbands is shown to be dominated by thermal emission from very small grains, not line emission from atomic hydrogen or forbidden atomic lines, shocked molecular hydrogen, or PAHs. The doppler velocities derived from the two brightest emission lines in the rings, however, suggest that the material from which the rings were formed was ejected during an early period of very heavy mass loss from the PN progenitor, then shaped by asymmetrical fast winds from the central binary pair.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of Th III energy levels and transitions for applications to kilonova spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron star merger is a promising site of heavy element production. By producing heavy elements, the neutron star merger gives rise to a thermal transient called a kilonova. Studying kilonova spectra enables us to quantify the heavy element production. Among the heaviest elements, doubly ionized Thorium (Th, Z=90) is one of the important candidates for producing detectable absorption features in kilonova spectra. This paper investigates the atomic properties of Th III to provide energy level and transition data. The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods, which are implemented in the general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package GRASP2018, are used to compute energy levels of the $\mathrm{5f6d}$, $\mathrm{6d^2}$, $\mathrm{7s^2}$, $5\mathrm{f^2}$, $\mathrm{6d7s}$, $\mathrm{5f7p}$ and $\mathrm{5f7s}$ configurations and electric dipole transitions between states of these configurations. The accuracy of energy levels is evaluated by comparing it with experimental data and with various theoretical methods. Our calculated energy levels are consistent with the experimental results with a root mean square (RMS) deviation of 436 cm$^{-1}$. The accuracy of transition data is investigated using the quantitative and qualitative evaluation method.By performing radiative transfer simulations for kilonova spectra with our transition data, we show that kilonova including Th with a mass fraction of $(3-10) \times 10^{-5}$ can produce Th III absorption features around 18,000 A.</description>

      <title>Probing the Origins I: Generalised Additive Model inference of birth radii for Milky Way stars in the solar vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) to address the limitations inherent in radial metallicity gradients predicted by chemical evolution models, thereby facilitating the estimation of birth radii for the thin disc stars in our sample based on their ages and chemical composition. We then juxtapose the birth radius predictions derived from the GAM with the calculated guiding radii, among other dynamic parameters. Metal-rich stars, formed in the inner regions of the Milky Way, seem to be predominantly churned outward. Their metal-poor counterparts, formed in the outer thin disc, exhibit the opposite behaviour. The proportion of blurred/undisturbed stars generally increases with decreasing metallicity when compared to their churned counterparts. Approximately $3/4$ of the sample has been affected by (inward or outward) churning, while the remaining $\sim 1/4$ has either been influenced by blurring or remained undisturbed. These percentages vary considerably across different metallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between churned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being the outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the youngest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages. We also detect significant differences in angular momenta in the $z$ component, for stars that have either churned inward or outward, when compared to their blurred/undisturbed counterparts. Additionally, we observe the potential effects of the pericentric passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in our most metal-poor subset of stars, formed in the outer disc. Finally, we estimate that the Sun's most probable birth radius is $7.08 \pm 0.24$ kpc, with a 3$\sigma$ range spanning from 6.46 to 7.81 kpc, in agreement with previous studies.</description>

      <title>Surveying the Giant HII Regions of the Milky Way with SOFIA: VII. Galactic Center Regions Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the mid-infrared properties of Giant HII (GHII) regions in the Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) -- Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and Sgr C -- using SOFIA-FORCAST imaging at 25 and 37 microns. It compares these mid-infrared data with previous multi-wavelength observations to explore their present star formation activity and global properties. The study identifies 77 massive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates in and around the three regions. Sgr B2 appears to host the youngest MYSOs and have much higher extinction than the other regions, containing several radio sources not detected in the mid-infrared even at 37 microns. Meanwhile, cm radio continuum regions of Sgr B1 shows remarkable correspondence to its mid-infrared emission. Sgr C has fewer confirmed MYSOs, and seems to have a higher fraction of low-mass young stellar objects and contamination from more evolved interloper/foreground stars. Derived MYSO densities are consistent with GHII regions elsewhere in the Galactic plane, though the CMZ GHII regions appear to have less prolific present star formation overall. Unlike Sgr B2, the cm continuum emission in Sgr B1 and Sgr C GHII regions appears to be absent cold dust and molecular gas, suggesting environmental differences, possibly driven by turbulence and rapid dynamical changes near the Galactic Center. Furthermore, unlike typical GHII regions, Sgr B1 and Sgr C are significantly ionized by evolved interloper stars, which likely did not form within these regions. In these ways, Sgr B1 and Sgr C deviate from classical GHII region behavior, thus potentially representing a new category of GHII region or challenging their classification as GHII regions.</description>

      <title>Low mode approximation in the axion magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of interacting large scale magnetic and axionic fields. Based on the new induction equation accounting for the contribution of spatially inhomogeneous axions, we consider the evolution of a magnetized spherical axion structure. Using the thin layer approximation, we derive the system of the nonlinear ordinary differential equations for harmonics of poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, as well as for the axion field. In this system, we account for up to four modes. Considering this small and dense axion clump to be in a solar plasma, we numerically simulate the evolution of magnetic fields. We obtain that the behavior of magnetic fields depends on the initial fields configuration. Moreover, we find an indication on a magnetic field instability in the magnetohydrodynamics with inhomogeneous axions.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: While class II pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of PMS stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims: Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of class II disks, as well as address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods: We studied the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carried out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results: Gas accreting on class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 80%-100% success rate with only a 2 min exposure time, depending on the filter, if stars with both an accretion rate \dot{M} &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and a luminosity L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.</description>

      <title>An upper limit on the frequency of short-period black hole companions to Sun-like stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 million TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidates for such variations. However, spectroscopic followup of 250 of them shows that none are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (2 $\sigma$ confidence) that fewer than one in $10^5$ Solar-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood host a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of ``optimistic'' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in $10^{4-5}$ stars. Our limits are still consistent with other models that predict only a few in $10^{7-8}$.</description>

      <title>Coronal kink oscillations and photospheric driving: combining SolO/EUI and SST/CRISP high-resolution observations</title>

Abstract: The driving and excitation mechanisms of decay-less kink oscillations in coronal loops remain under debate. We aim to quantify and provide simple observational constraints on the photospheric driving of oscillating coronal loops in a few typical active region configurations: sunspot, plage, pores and enhanced-network regions. We then aim to investigate the possible interplay between photospheric driving and properties of kink oscillations in connected coronal loops. We analyse two unique datasets of the corona and photosphere taken at a high resolution during the first coordinated observation campaign between Solar Orbiter and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A local correlation tracking method is applied on the SST/CRISP data to quantify the photospheric motions at the base of coronal loops. The same loops are then analysed in the corona by exploiting data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on Solar Orbiter, and by using a wavelet analysis to characterize the kink oscillations. Each photospheric region shows dynamics with an overall increase in strength going from pore, plage, enhanced-network to sunspot regions. Differences are also seen in the kink-mode amplitudes of the corresponding coronal loops. This suggests the photosphere is involved in the driving of coronal kink oscillations. However, the few samples available does not allow to further establish the excitation mechanism yet. Despite oscillating coronal loops being anchored in seemingly "static" strong magnetic field regions as seen from coronal EUV observations, photospheric observations provide evidence for a continuous and significant driving at their base. The precise connection between photospheric driving and coronal kink oscillations remains to be further investigated. This study finally provides critical constraints on photospheric driving that can be tested in existing numerical models of coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the near-core rotation frequency of 2,497 intermediate-mass stars from their dominant gravito-inertial mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combined Gaia DR3 and TESS photometric light curves to estimate the internal physical properties of 2,497 gravity-mode pulsators. We relied on asteroseismic properties of Kepler $\gamma\,$Dor and SPB stars to derive the near-core rotation frequency, $f_{\rm rot}$, of the Gaia-discovered pulsators from their dominant prograde dipole gravito-inertial pulsation mode. We offer a recipe based on linear regression to deduce $f_{\rm rot}$ from the dominant gravito-inertial mode frequency. It is applicable to prograde dipole modes with an amplitude above 4mmag and occurring in the sub-inertial regime. By applying it to the 2,497 pulsators, we have increased the sample of intermediate-mass dwarfs with such an asteroseismic observable by a factor of 4. We used the estimate of $f_{\rm rot}$ to deduce spin parameters between 2 and 6, while the sample's near-core rotation rates range from 0.7% to 25% of the critical Keplerian rate. We used $f_{\rm rot}$, along with the Gaia effective temperature and luminosity to deduce the (convective core) mass, radius, and evolutionary stage from grid modelling based on rotating stellar models. We derived a decline of $f_{\rm rot}$ with a factor of 2 during the main-sequence evolution for this population of field stars, which covers a mass range from 1.3M$_\odot$ to 7M$_\odot$. We found observational evidence for an increase in the radial order of excited gravity modes as the stars evolve. For 969 pulsators, we derived an upper limit of the radial differential rotation between the convective core boundary and the surface from Gaia's vbroad measurement and found values up to 5.4. Our recipe for the near-core rotation frequency from the dominant gravito-inertial mode detected in the independent Gaia and TESS light curves is easy to use, facilitates applications to large samples, and allows to map their angular momentum and evolutionary stage in the Milky Way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the association of gamma-ray bursts with massive stellar death is on firm footing, the nature of the progenitor system and the key ingredients required for a massive star to produce a gamma-ray burst remain open questions. Here, we investigate the evolution of a massive star with a closely orbiting black hole using the stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA}. In particular, we examine how the companion influences the angular momentum of the massive star as it evolves over its lifetime under a range of orbital periods where the tidal effects are significant. We consider dependence on stellar metallicity, mass ratio, initial stellar spin, as well as accretion and dynamo prescriptions while tracking the mass loss and angular momentum in the simulations. We conclude that massive star-black hole binary systems with low metallicity massive stars under an initial orbital period range of $\sim$20-50 days may be viable GRB progenitors with post-collapse black hole masses of 5-10 $M_\odot$ and a black hole spin parameter $\geq 0.5$.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight bosons. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we focus on the superradiance of a scalar boson, and perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modeled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

Abstract: The triple-$\alpha$ reaction from the ternary continuum states at off-resonant energies, $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha\rightarrow^{12}$C, remains an open question. This direct process is estimated using a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyperspherical harmonics $R$-matrix expansion method. After reviewing the model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1\rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be much smaller than the values predicted by the adiabatic models for $0.15 \le E \le 0.35$ MeV. Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \le T_9 \le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced by about 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining sensitivity to 3$\alpha$ potentials. With introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\alpha+^8$Be could be eliminated by hand. The astrophysical impact is not expected to be large, although the rates are reduced around $T_9=0.05$.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics and dissipation in the binary magnetosphere of pre-merger neutron stars</title>

Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNSs) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system dynamics depend on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. A Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)-type instability drives significant dissipation at the magnetospheric interface, generating local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the companions. Outgoing compressive waves occur in a broad range of BNS parameters, possibly developing shocks and sourcing fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.</description>

      <title>ALMA reveals thermal and non-thermal desorption of methanol ice in the HD 100546 protoplanetary disk</title>

Abstract: Methanol (CH$_3$OH) and formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) are chemically coupled organic molecules proposed to act as an intermediate step between simple molecules and more complex prebiotic compounds. Their abundance distributions across disks regulate the prebiotic potential of material at different disk radii. We present observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward the Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous serendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a higher rotational temperature ($T_\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both the centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au) and a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au). $T_\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner ($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K and $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical environments. $T_\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent with thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven by non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases from $14.6^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer disk, consistent with modelling predictions. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio for the inner disk is consistent with the median value in the range of column density ratios compiled from Solar System comets which would have formed at a similar distance. This supports the notion that interstellar ice is inherited and preserved by protoplanetary disks around solar-mass and intermediate-mass stars as we are seeing 'fresh' ice sublimation, as well as providing more evidence for the presence of prebiotic precursor molecules in planet-forming regions.</description>

      <title>HCN and C2H2 in the atmosphere of a T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary</title>

Abstract: T-type brown dwarfs present an opportunity to explore atmospheres teeming with molecules such as H2O, CH4 and NH3, which exhibit a wealth of absorption features in the mid-infrared. With JWST, we can finally explore this chemistry in detail, including for the coldest brown dwarfs that were not yet discovered in the Spitzer era. This allows precise derivations of the molecular abundances, which in turn informs our understanding of vertical transport in these atmospheres and can provide clues about the formation of cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets. This study presents the first JWST/MRS mid-IR spectrum (R ~ 1500-3000) of a T-dwarf: the T8.5+T9 brown dwarf binary WISE J045853.90+643451.9. We fit the spectrum using a parameterized P-T profile and free molecular abundances (i.e., a retrieval analysis), treating the binary as unresolved. We find a good fit with a cloud-free atmosphere and identify H2O, CH4 and NH3 features. Moreover, we make the first detections of HCN and C2H2 (at 13.4$\sigma$ and 9.5$\sigma$ respectively) in any brown dwarf atmosphere. The detection of HCN suggests intense vertical mixing ($K_{zz}\sim10^{11}$cm$^2$s$^{-1}$), challenging previous literature derivations of $K_{zz}$ values for T-type brown dwarfs. Even more surprising is the C2H2 detection, which cannot be explained with existing atmospheric models for isolated objects. This result challenges model assumptions about vertical mixing, and/or our understanding of the C2H2 chemical network, or might hint towards a more complex atmospheric processes such as magnetic fields driving aurorae, or lightning driving ionization. These findings open a new frontier in studying carbon chemistry within brown dwarf atmospheres.</description>
