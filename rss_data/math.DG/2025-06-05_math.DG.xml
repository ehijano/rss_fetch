      <title>Compact spacelike biconservative hypersurfaces in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the geometry of compact spacelike biconservative hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature in de Sitter space $\mathbb{S}_1^{m+1}(c)$, under some geometric constraints. Our results extend the understanding of rigidity properties of such hypersurfaces in pseudo-Riemannian settings.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a synthetic null hypersurface as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the synthetic null energy condition ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$ is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we obtain various sharpenings of the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem: for smooth spacetimes we show that the incomplete null geodesic whose existence is guaranteed by Penrose's argument is actually maximizing; we extend Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes; we prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic $\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates and parabolic frequency monotonicity for positive solutions of the heat equation under generalized Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish Li-Yau-type and Hamilton-type estimates for positive solutions to the heat equation associated with the generalized Ricci flow, under a less stringent curvature condition. Compared with [25] and [35], these estimates generalize the results in Ricci flow to this new flow under the weaker Ricci curvature bounded assumption. As an application, we derive the Harnack-type inequalities in spacetime and find the monotonicity of one parabolic frequency for positive solutions of the heat equation under bounded Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>The asymptotics of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-Hitchin metric on the singular locus: subintegrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic hyperk\"ahler geometry of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-Hitchin moduli space over the singular fibers of the Hitchin fibration. We extend the previously known exponential convergence results for solutions to the Hitchin equation to the class of locally fiducial Higgs bundles defined by a special local description at the singularities of the spectral curve. This condition is satisfied by the Higgs bundles contained in certain subintegrable systems introduced by Hitchin. We prove that the restriction of the hyperk\"ahler metric to the subintegrable system converges exponentially fast to the corresponding semi-flat metric along a ray $(\mathcal{E},t\varphi)$. This answers a question posed by Hitchin in \cite{Hitchin2021subintegrable_special_Kaehler}. More generally, we prove that for each stratum of quadratic differentials there is a closed subset of the corresponding Hitchin fibers, such that the restricted hyperk\"ahler metric converges to a generalized semi-flat metric.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the Gauss map area of surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the lower bound of $4\pi(1+g)$ for the area of the Gauss map of any immersion of a closed oriented surface of genus $g$ into $\mathbb{S}^3$, taking values in the Grassmannian of $2$-planes in $\mathbb{R}^4$. This lower bound is proved to be optimal for any genus $g \in \mathbb{N}$ but attained only when $g = 0$. For $g \neq 0$ we describe the behavior of any minimizing sequence of embeddings: we prove that, modulo extraction of a subsequence, the surfaces converge in the Hausdorff distance to a round sphere $S$, and the integral cycles carried by the Gauss maps split into $g+1$ spheres, each of area $4\pi$; one of them corresponds to the cycle carried by the Gauss map of $S$, while the other $g$ arise from the concentration of negative Gauss curvature at $g$ points of $S$.
  The results of this paper are used by the second author to define a nontrivial homological 4-dimensional min-max scheme for the area of Gauss maps of immersions into $\mathbb{S}^3$ in relation to the Willmore conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary behavior of the singular Yamabe problem has been extensively studied near sufficiently smooth boundaries, while less is known about the asymptotic behavior of solutions near singular boundaries. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviors of solutions to the singular Yamabe problem with negative constant scalar curvature near singular boundaries and derive the optimal estimates for the background metric which is not necessarily conformally flat. In particular, we prove that the solutions are well approximated by the solutions in tangent cones at singular points on the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric inequalities in Hadamard spaces of asymptotic rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gromov's isoperimetric gap conjecture for Hadamard spaces states that cycles in dimensions greater than or equal to the asymptotic rank admit linear isoperimetric filling inequalities, as opposed to the inequalities of Euclidean type in lower dimensions. In the case of asymptotic rank 2, recent progress was made by Dru\c{t}u-Lang-Papasoglu-Stadler who established a homotopical inequality for Lipschitz 2-spheres with exponents arbitrarily close to 1. We prove a homological inequality of the same type for general cycles in dimensions at least 2, assuming that the ambient space has finite linearly controlled asymptotic dimension. This holds in particular for all Hadamard 3-manifolds and finite-dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space via Combinatorial Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his seminal work \cite{Ri96}, Rivin characterized finite ideal polyhedra in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. However, the characterization of infinite ideal polyhedra, as proposed by Rivin, has remained a long-standing open problem. In this paper, we introduce the combinatorial Ricci flow for infinite ideal circle patterns, a discrete analogue of Ricci flow on non-compact Riemannian manifolds, and prove a characterization of such circle patterns under certain combinatorial conditions. Our results provide affirmative solutions to Rivin's problem.</description>

      <title>Two closed geodesics on compact bumpy Finsler manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:1804.08452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove there are at least two closed geodesics
  on any compact bumpy Finsler $n$-manifold with finite fundamental group and $n\ge 2$.
  Thus generically there are at least two closed geodesics
  on compact Finsler manifolds with finite fundamental group. Furthermore, there are at least two closed geodesics
  on any compact Finsler $2$-manifold, and this lower bound is achieved
  by the Katok 2-sphere $(S^2, F)$ and 2-real projective space $(S^2/\Z_2, F)$, cf. \cite{Kat}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold equipped with a tensor structure of type $(1,1)$, whose fourth power is the identity, is considered. This structure acts as an isometry with respect to the metric. A Riemannian almost product manifold associated with such a manifold is also studied. It turns out, that the almost product manifold belongs to the class of locally conformal Riemannian product manifolds of the Naveira classification. Conditions for the additional structures of the manifolds to be parallel with respect to the Levi-Civita connection of the metric were found. Classes of almost Einstein manifolds and Einstein manifolds are determined and some of their curvature properties are obtained. As examples of these manifolds, a hypersurface is considered.</description>

      <title>Additional first order equation for infinitesimal bendings of smooth surfaces in the isothermal coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article contributes to the theory of infinitesimal bendings of smooth surfaces in Euclidean 3-space. We derive a linear differential equation of the first order, which previously did not appear in the literature and which is satisfied by any Darboux rotation field of a smooth surface. We show that, for some surfaces, this additional equation is functionally independent of the three standard equations that the Darboux rotation field satisfies (and by which it is determined). As a consequence of this additional equation, we prove the maximum principle for the components of the Darboux rotation field for a class of disk-homeomorphic surfaces containing not only surfaces of positive Gaussian curvature.</description>

      <title>Shifted coisotropic structures for differentiable stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of coisotropics on 1-shifted symplectic Lie groupoids (i.e. quasi-symplectic groupoids) using twisted Dirac structures and show that it satisfies properties analogous to the corresponding derived-algebraic notion in shifted Poisson geometry. In particular, intersections of 1-coisotropics are 0-shifted Poisson. We also show that 1-shifted coisotropic structures transfer through Morita equivalences, giving a well-defined notion for differentiable stacks. Most results are formulated with clean-intersection conditions weaker than transversality while avoiding derived geometry. Examples of 1-coisotropics that are not necessarily Lagrangians include Hamiltonian actions of quasi-symplectic groupoids on Dirac manifolds, and this recovers several generalizations of Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer's symplectic reduction via intersection and Morita transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>
