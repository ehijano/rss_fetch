      <title>Variational Principle for Optical Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {The problem of laser beam concentration in a focal spot via wavefront variations is formulated as a maximization of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$ defined as the light power passing through aperture of an arbitrary shape located in the far field. Variational principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for at least the $local$ $maximum$ of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$. The wavefront shape is obtained as exact solution of nonlinear integral equation.}</description>

      <title>Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, an infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.</description>

      <title>Self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological edge states typically arise at the boundaries of topologically nontrivial structures or at interfaces between regions with differing topological invariants. When topological systems are extended into the nonlinear regime, linear topological edge states bifurcate into nonlinear counterparts, and topological gap solitons emerge in the bulk of the structures. Despite extensive studies of these two types of nonlinear states, self-induced topological edge states localized at the physical boundaries of originally nontopological structures remain underexplored. Unlike the previously reported self-induced topological transitions driven by nonlinear couplings, which are conceptually straightforward but less common in realistic interacting systems, here we experimentally realize self-induced topological edge states in a lattice with onsite nonlinearity. Leveraging the strong and tunable nonlinearity of electrical circuits, we systematically investigate the localized states in a nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Besides revisiting the nonlinear topological edge states and topological gap solitons, we uncover a novel type of self-induced topological edge states which exhibit the hallmark features of linear topological edge states, including sublattice polarization, phase jumps, and decaying tails that approach zero. A distinctive feature of these states is the boundary-induced power threshold for existence. Our results are broadly applicable and can be readily extended to photonic and cold atomic systems, where onsite nonlinearities naturally arise from interparticle interactions. Our work unveils new opportunities for exploring novel correlated topological states of light and matter, and paves the way for the development of robust photonic devices and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave profiles for a semi-discrete Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look for traveling waves of the semi-discrete conservation law $4\dot u_j +u_{j+1}^2-u_{j-1}^2 = 0$, using variational principles related to concepts of ``hidden convexity'' appearing in recent studies of various PDE (partial differential equations). We analyze and numerically compute with two variational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems constrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear integral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence theorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict convexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic and non-periodic wave phenomena.</description>

      <title>Observation of edge solitons and transitions between them in a trimer circuit lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonlinear topological systems, edge solitons either bifurcate from linear topological edge modes or emerge as nonlinearity-induced localized states without topological protection. While electric circuits (ECs) provide a platform for realizing various types of topological insulators, observation of edge solitons and transitions between them in EC lattices remains a challenging problem. Here, we realize quench dynamics in nonlinear ECs to experimentally demonstrate both topological and nontopological edge solitons in a trimer EC lattice and transitions between them. In the weakly-nonlinear regime, we observe antisymmetric (alias staggered) and symmetric (alias unstaggered) edge solitons bifurcating from the respective topological edge states in the linear limit. Under the action of strong nonlinearity, nontopological edge solitons with antisymmetric, symmetric, and asymmetric (strongly confined) internal structures are discovered. This work suggests new possibilities for exploring sophisticated nonlinear states and transitions between them in nonlinear topological systems.</description>
