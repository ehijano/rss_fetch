      <title>Dirac fermions under imaginary rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the properties of an ensemble of free Dirac fermions, at finite inverse temperature $\beta$ and finite chemical potential $\mu$, undergoing rigid rotation with an imaginary angular velocity $\Omega_I$. Our purpose is to establish the analytical structure of such states, as well as the prospects (and dangers) of extrapolating results obtained under imaginary rotation to the case of real rotation. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, the state of the system is akin to a stationary system with modified inverse temperature $\beta_q = q\beta$ and the same chemical potential, where $q$ is the denominator of the irreducible fraction $\nu = \beta \Omega_I / 2\pi = p/q$. The temperature of the system becomes a fractal function of the rotation parameter, as in the case of the scalar field. The chemical potential breaks the fractalization of fermions. We also compute the thermodynamic potential $\Phi$ and associated thermodynamic functions, showing that they also exhibit fractal behavior. Finally, we evaluate the axial and helical flux through the transverse plane, generated through the vortical effects, and show that they diverge in the thermodynamic limit, in the case when $\nu = 1/q$ and $q \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Probing the self-coherence of primordial quantum fluctuations with complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smoking gun for our current paradigm of the early universe would be direct evidence for the quantum mechanical origin of density perturbations which are conjectured to seed the large scale structure of our universe. A recently-proposed novel phenomenon is that of \textit{recoherence}, wherein a specific interaction between the adiabatic and the entropic sector leads to the adiabatic mode retaining a coherent state after a transient increase in linear entropy. In this paper, we choose the most general Gaussian action and analyze the evolution of linear entropy, complexity of purification (COP), and complexity of formation (COF) to capture the interplay between decoherence and recoherence in this model. In the presence of two types of couplings that drive these two opposing characteristics, we highlight how COF is an efficient tool for diagnosing dynamics for such an open quantum system.</description>

      <title>A numerical analysis of Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Minimax surfaces and the holographic entropy cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study and prove properties of the minimax formulation of the HRT holographic entanglement entropy formula, which involves finding the maximal-area surface on a timelike hypersurface, or time-sheet, and then minimizing over the choice of time-sheet. In this formulation, the homology condition is imposed at the level of the spacetime: the homology regions are spacetime volumes rather spatial regions. We show in particular that the smallest minimax homology region is the entanglement wedge. The minimax prescription suggests a way to construct a graph model for time-dependent states, a weighted graph on which min cuts compute HRT entropies. The existence of a graph model would imply that HRT entropies obey the same inequalities as RT entropies, in other words that the RT and HRT entropy cones coincide. Our construction of a graph model relies on the time-sheets obeying a certain ``cooperating'' property, which we show holds in some examples and for which we give a partial proof; however, we also find scenarios where it may fail.</description>

      <title>Tensor condensate accompanied by chiral transition in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate tensor condensates and chiral condensates in the (2+1)-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model at finite temperature and density in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The emergence of the tensor condensate is attributed to the four-fermion interaction. It is shown that a sufficiently large chemical potential is necessary for the occurrence of a phase transition towards tensor condensate. Furthermore, we investigate the correlation between tensor condensate and spin polarization, which accounts for the oscillatory behavior of the spin polarization during the transition from the chiral condensate to tensor condensate phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum Schwarzschild-(A)dS Black Holes: Unitarity and Singularity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the canonical quantisation of spherically symmetric spacetimes within unimodular gravity, leaving sign choices in the metric general enough to include both the interior and exterior Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter spacetime. In unimodular gravity the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant analogous to a total energy, and the quantum Wheeler-DeWitt equation takes the form of a Schr\"odinger equation in unimodular time. We discuss self-adjoint extensions of the Schr\"odinger-like Hamiltonian arising from the requirement of unitarity in unimodular time, and identify a physically motivated one-parameter family of extensions. For semiclassical states we are able to derive analytical expressions for expectation values of the metric, representing a quantum-corrected, nonsingular extension of the classical Schwarzschild-(A)dS geometry which describes a quantum transition between asymptotic black hole and white hole states. The sign of the self-adjoint extension parameter corresponds to the allowed sign of the black hole/white hole mass, and so it can be chosen to ensure that this mass is always positive. We also discuss tunnelling states which allow for a change in the sign of the mass, but which are not semiclassical in high-curvature regions. Our mechanism for singularity resolution and the explicit form of the quantum-corrected metric can be compared to other proposals for black holes in quantum gravity, and in the asymptotically AdS case can be contrasted with holographic arguments.</description>

      <title>A note on rank $\frac{3}{2}$ Liouville irregular block</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a conformal block with rank $\frac{3}{2}$ irregular singularity which corresponds to the prepotential of the ${\cal H}_1$ Argyres-Douglas theory in $\Omega$ background. We derive this irregular conformal block using generalized holomorphic anomaly recursion relation. This results is an expression which is a power series in $\Omega$-background parameters $\epsilon_{1,2}$ and exact in coupling. We have verified that in small coupling regime our result is consistent with previously known expressions.
  Furthermore we derive the Deformed Seiberg-Witten curve which provides an alternative tool to explore above mentioned theory in Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of $\Omega$-background. We checked that the results are in complete agreement with the holomorphic anomaly approach.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry and trace formulas III. Frenkel trace formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying the new supersymmetric localization principle introduced in \cite{Choi:2021yuz,Choi:2023pjn}, we present two complementary approaches for the path integral derivation of the `non-chiral' trace formula for a semisimple compact Lie group $G$, which generalizes the so-called Frenkel trace formula. Corresponding physical systems for each picture are the quantum mechanical sigma model on $G$ and the gauged sigma model on $G\times G$, and the approaches closely follow the spirit of the Eskin trace formula \cite{Choi:2021yuz} and the Selberg trace formula \cite{Choi:2023pjn} respectively. These methods provide a natural conceptual bridge between two seemingly independent derivations in \cite{Choi:2021yuz} and \cite{Choi:2023pjn}.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based holography for T-linear resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ deep learning within holographic duality to investigate $T$-linear resistivity, a hallmark of strange metals. Utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks, we incorporate boundary data for $T$-linear resistivity and bulk differential equations into a loss function. This approach allows us to derive dilaton potentials in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theories, capturing essential features of strange metals, such as $T$-linear resistivity and linear specific heat scaling. We also explore the impact of the resistivity slope on dilaton potentials. Regardless of slope, dilaton potentials exhibit universal exponential growth at low temperatures, driving $T$-linear resistivity and matching infrared geometric analyses. At a specific slope, our method rediscovers the Gubser-Rocha model, a well-known holographic model of strange metals. Additionally, the robustness of $T$-linear resistivity at higher temperatures correlates with the asymptotic AdS behavior of the dilaton coupling to the Maxwell term. Our findings suggest that deep learning could help uncover mechanisms in holographic condensed matter systems and advance our understanding of strange metals.</description>

      <title>Dissecting supergraviton six-point function with lightcone limits and chiral algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a bootstrap strategy to obtain the six-point function of supergravitons in $AdS_5\times S^5$ from symmetry constraints and consistency conditions. Compared to previous bootstrap algorithms, a novel feature is the use of lightcone OPEs together with the chiral algebra constraint. This makes it possible to isolate different parts of the correlator and fix them separately. Our strategy allows us to gain a refined understanding of the power of different bootstrap constraints, which is also useful for computing more general correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2306.17553 a new supersymmetric integrable QFT was constructed from the relativistic limit of the worlsdheet theory of AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3\times $T$^4$ superstrings with mixed Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz flux. The model is closely reminiscent of one previously considered by Fendley and Intriligator, though it enjoys twice as many supersymmetries. In this paper we study its finite-volume and finite-temperature properties. We formulate the string hypothesis for the Bethe--Yang equations, write down the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations, and simplify them in the form of a Y-system. We obtain three decoupled sectors associated with massive, massless-chiral and massless-antichiral particles, for which we compute the UV central charge. We illustrate the similarities and differences between this model and the one of Fendley and Intriligator.</description>

      <title>Microstates of AdS$_5$ black holes with hypermultiplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct supersymmetric rotating AdS$_5$ black holes in 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets and a universal hypermultiplet, and verify their microscopic counting from the superconformal index of the dual 4d class $\mathcal{S}$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs. From the CFT, we perform the Legendre transform of the index to the microcanonical ensemble. The theories are parametrized by a rational number $z$ which enters into the extremization equations making them more challenging to solve. We present a method to address these difficulties and highlight the subtleties involved. From the gravity perspective, we identify a charged, rotating black hole whose Bekenstein-Hawking entropy matches the prediction from the index for $z=\pm1$. Beyond this value, where hypermultiplet scalars are nonzero, we construct the near-horizon extremal geometry perturbatively around $z= 1$ and verify that the entropy is consistent with the CFT prediction. We discuss the thermodynamics and verify the near-horizon versions of the first law of thermodynamics and the supersymmetric condition. In this setting, our analysis characterizes the first construction of a rotating black hole geometry in a 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theory that contains hypermultiplets.</description>

      <title>Scalar weak gravity bound from full unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravity conjecture can be formulated as a statement that gravity must be the weakest force, compared to the other interactions in low energy effective field theory (EFT). Several arguments in favor of this statement were presented from the side of string theory and black hole physics. However, it is still an open question whether the statement of weak gravity can be proven based on more general assumptions of causality, unitarity, and locality of the fundamental theory. These consistency requirements imply the dispersion relations for the scattering amplitudes which allow to bound the EFT coefficients. The main difficulty for obtaining these constraints in the presence of gravity is related to the graviton pole which makes the required dispersion relations divergent in the forward limit. In this work, we present a new way of deriving the bound on the ratio between the EFT cutoff scale and Planck mass from confronting the IR divergences from graviton pole and one-loop running of the EFT Wilson coefficient in front of the dimension-12 operator. Our method also allows the incorporation of full unitarity of partial wave expansion of the UV theory. We examine the EFT of a single shift-symmetric scalar in four dimensions and find that the maximal value of the cutoff scale of the EFT coupled to gravity must be lower than about $O(10)$ Planck mass.</description>

      <title>Flipped Rotating Axion Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity: Baryogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the co-genesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be achieved through the rotation of an axion-like particle, driven by a flip in the vacuum manifold's direction at the end of inflation. This can occur if the axion has a periodic non-minimal coupling to gravity, while preserving the discrete shift symmetry. In non-oscillating inflation models, after inflation there is typically a period of kination (with $w = 1$). In this case, it is shown that the vacuum manifold of the axion is flipped and the axion begins rotating in field space, because it can slide across the decreasing potential barrier as in Ricci reheating. Such a rotating axion can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through spontaneous baryogenesis, while at later epochs it can oscillate as dark matter. The period of kination makes the primordial gravitational waves (GW) generated during inflation sharply blue-tilted which constrains the parameter space due to GW overproduction, while being testable by next generation CMB experiments. As a concrete example, we show that such a cogenesis of baryon asymmetry and dark matter can be realized for the axion as the Majoron in the Type-I seesaw setup, predicting mass ranges for the Majoron below sub eVs, with right-handed neutrino mass above $\mathcal{O}(10^{8})$ GeV. We also show that in order to avoid fragmentation of the axion condensate during the rotation, we require the non-minimal coupling \mbox{$\xi \sim (f/m_P)^2 $} or somewhat larger, where $f$ is the axion decay constant.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of $n$-Replica Time Evolution in the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the $n$-replica time evolution operator $\mathcal{U}_n(t)\equiv e^{\mathcal{L}_nt} $ for the Brownian Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (BGUE) using a graph-theoretic approach. We examine the moments of the generating operator $\mathcal{L}_n$, which governs the Euclidean time evolution within an auxiliary $D^{2n}$-dimensional Hilbert space, where $D$ represents the dimension of the Hilbert space for the original system. Explicit representations for the cases of $n = 2$ and $n = 3$ are derived, emphasizing the role of graph categorization in simplifying calculations. Furthermore, we present a general approach to streamline the calculation of time evolution for arbitrary $n$, supported by a detailed example of $n = 4$. Our results demonstrate that the $n$-replica framework not only facilitates the evaluation of various observables but also provides valuable insights into the relationship between Brownian disordered systems and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Wigner multiplets in QFT: dark sector and CPT-violating scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of elementary particles based on unitary irreducible representations of the Poincare group has been a cornerstone of modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT). While the Standard Model (SM) does not inherently include Dark Matter (DM), any fundamental DM candidate should still conform to this classification or its extensions. Beyond the standard representations, Wigner introduced a class of nontrivial states characterized by an additional discrete degree of freedom, known as the Wigner degeneracy. We systematically investigate the QFT of such Wigner degenerate multiplets, particularly focusing on the massive spin-1/2 case. We construct a theoretical framework where the two-fold Wigner spinor fields, \psi_{\pm\frac{1}{2}}(x), form a doublet representation. We analyze their transformation properties under discrete symmetries (C, P, and T), revealing novel mixing effects due to Wigner degeneracy and an emergent accidental U(2) global symmetry. Furthermore, we explore their Yukawa and gauge interactions, demonstrating that such interactions generally break the CPT symmetry. However, we derive conditions for the CPT conservation and discuss potential phenomenological consequences beyond the SM. These results provide new insights into the possible role of Wigner-degenerate states in fundamental physics, particularly in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Lattice Schwinger Model and Spacetime Supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories in (1+1)D have attracted renewed attention partially due to their experimental realizations in quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we revisit the lattice massive Schwinger model and the (1+1)D lattice Abelian-Higgs model, uncovering previously overlooked universal features, including the emergence of a supersymmetric quantum critical point when the Maxwell term's coefficient changes sign. To facilitate the quantum simulation of these theories, we adopt a strategy of truncating the electric field eigenvalues to a finite subset, preserving the exact gauge and global symmetries. Our primary focus is the truncated lattice Schwinger model at $\theta=0$, a model not equivalent to familiar spin models. We find that upon reversing the sign of the Maxwell term, the second-order deconfinement-confinement transition can become first-order, and the two types of transitions are connected by a supersymmetric critical point in the tricritical Ising universality class. In the case of truncated abelian-Higgs model at $\theta=0$, which turns out to be equivalent to the quantum Blume-Capel model, the very existence of a deconfined phase requires a negative-sign Maxwell term. Similarly, there is a tricritical Ising point separating first-order and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Simpler Embeddings of Causal Sets into Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for embedding a causal set into Minkowski spacetime. The method is similar to a previously presented method, but is simpler and provides better embedding results. The method uses spacetime volumes to define causal set analogs of time coordinates for all elements, and spatial distances for pairs of causally related elements. The spatial distances for causally related pairs are then used to derive spatial distances for spaceliked separated pairs by applying the triangle inequality. The result is a matrix of spatial distances for all pairs of elements in the causal set. This distance matrix can be decomposed to give coordinates in Minkowski spacetime. Results are presented showing good quality embeddings into Minkowski spacetime for dimensions d=2,3,4.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity meets maximal chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fading ergodicity provides a theoretical framework for understanding deviations from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) near ergodicity-breaking transitions. In this work, we demonstrate that the breakdown of the ETH at the interaction-driven ergodicity-breaking critical point in the quantum sun model gives rise to to the maximally divergent fidelity susceptibility. We further extend our analysis to the energy-driven ergodicity-breaking transition associated with the many-body mobility edge. Specifically, we show that fidelity susceptibilities at energies away from the middle of the spectrum exhibit a divergent peak near the mobility edge. Finally, we argue that fading ergodicity provides a simple and accurate description of the ETH breakdown in the quantum sun model, which is accompanied with the emergence of a peak in fidelity susceptibility and the onset of maximal chaos at the ergodicity-breaking critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we review some methods that tried to solve the information loss problem. In particular, we revisit the solution based on Hawking radiation as tunneling, and provide a detailed statistical interpretation on the black hole entropy in terms of the quantum tunneling probability of Hawking radiation from the black hole. In addition, we show that black hole evaporation is governed by a time-dependent Schrodinger equation that sends pure states into pure states rather than into mixed states (Hawking had originally established that the final result would be mixed states). This is further confirmation of the fact that black hole evaporation is unitary.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle mimicking dynamical Dark Energy: matter perturbations and gravitational wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) stands out as a nearly ubiquitous feature in quantum gravity modeling, predicting the emergence of a minimum length at the Planck scale. Recently, it has been shown to modify the area-law scaling of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, giving rise to deformed Friedmann equations within Jacobson's approach. The ensuing model incorporates the GUP correction as a quintessence-like dark energy that supplements the cosmological constant, influencing the dynamics of the early Universe while aligning with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm in the current epoch. In this extended scenario, we examine the growth of matter perturbations and structure formation employing the Top-Hat Spherical Collapse approach. Our analysis reveals that the profile of the density contrast is sensitive to the GUP parameter $\beta$, resulting in a slower gravitational evolution of primordial fluctuations in the matter density. We also discuss implications for the relic density of Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs), identifying the parameter space that enhances the PGW spectrum. Using the sensitivity of the next-generation GW observatories in the frequency range below $10^3\,\mathrm{Hz}$, we constrain $\beta\lesssim10^{39}$, which is more stringent than most other cosmological/astrophysical limits. This finding highlights the potential role of GWs in the pursuit of understanding quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: We introduce ``local uncertainty relations'' in thermal many-body systems, from which fundamental bounds in quantum systems can be derived. These lead to universal non-relativistic speed limits (independent of interaction range) and transport coefficient bounds (e.g., those of the diffusion constant and viscosity) that are compared against experimental data.</description>

      <title>Test fields and naked singularities: is the second law the cosmic censor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been claimed that a Kerr-Newman black hole can generically be overspun by neutral test fields, and it has been argued that even when backreactions are taken into account, the black hole can still be destroyed. In this paper, we revisit the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for a Kerr-Newman black hole with a test scalar field and a neutrino field, and point out that the assumption in previous work regarding the energy and angular momentum of the test fields absorbed by the black hole violates the second law of black hole thermodynamics. By solving the test scalar field and neutrino field near the event horizon explicitly, we demonstrate that an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole cannot be overspun by a test scalar field but can be destroyed by a neutrino field. Our results indicate that the condition required to overspin an extremal Kerr-Newman black hole coincides with the condition needed to violate the second law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we observe that such a violation of the second law might inevitably result in a breakdown of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration in QC_2D from effective model using the functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The order of the chiral phase transition in two-color and two-flavor QC$_2$D is investigated using the functional renormalization group (FRG) technique in an effective model setting. We calculate the $\beta$ function of all couplings in the dimensionally reduced Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional with Pauli-G\"ursey SU(4) symmetry. We compare results of the perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion approach with those obtained via the FRG, evaluated directly in $d=3$ dimensions. The perturbative results suggest that the fixed-point structure is more intricate than that of three-color QCD, a conclusion further supported by the FRG analysis. Both methods display an infrared stable $O(6)$ fixed point at infinite axial anomaly; however, the FRG approach also reveals the existence of $U_A(1)$ anomaly-free fixed points, which can become infrared stable if the anomaly in the underlying theory vanishes at the critical temperature. These findings imply that the phase transition can be of second order, consistent with earlier findings for three colors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spontaneous breaking of $SO(10)$ grand unified symmetry to the left-right symmetric model $SU(3)_c \times SU(3)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}$ with C-parity also unbroken [$C$ converts $Q\to -Q$, where $Q$ is the electric charge operator in $SO(10)$.] This breaking produces the topologically stable GUT monopole as well as a GUT scale C-string. The subsequent breaking at an intermediate scale of C-parity produces domain walls bounded by C-strings, found by Kibble, Lazarides and Shafi. A limited number of inflationary $e$-foldings experienced during these breakings can yield an observable number density of primordial GUT monopoles. The C-strings also experience this inflationary phase, and the subsequent string-wall network decays through the emission of gravitational waves. We estimate the gravitational wave spectrum from these composite structures over a range of values of the domain wall tension $\sigma$. Depending on $\sigma$ the spectrum displays a peak in the higher frequency range between $10^2$ to $10^5$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Modeling of acceleration in heavy-ion collisions: occurrence of temperature below the Unruh temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that extremely strong electric fields can be created in central collisions of heavy ions, due to which the Schwinger effect can be significant. A direct analogue of the electric field in hydrodynamics is the acceleration of the medium. Using the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) framework we model the Au-Au collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=4.5-11.5\,$GeV and obtain the spatial distribution of acceleration at different time moments. The present study demonstrates that extremely high acceleration of the order of 1 GeV may be generated in both central and non-central collisions, and that the distribution exhibits a core-corona structure. Consequently, in contrast to the case with an electric field, the Unruh effect is expected to be significant. It is demonstrated that for the confined phase the temperature is less than the Unruh temperature. Conversely, in the deconfined phase, the relationship is inverse. The obtained results thus support the prediction about the existence of states with $T&lt;T_U$ at the early stages of the collision and the associated complementary description of thermalization in terms of the novel phase transition at the Unruh temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential, focusing on boson-boson interactions derived from the {\Phi^3} theory. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvature on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters. Our results underscore the nuanced interplay between spacetime curvature and quantum interactions, providing insights into nucleon-nucleon systems in curved spacetimes or near strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians to all Orders in Perturbation Theory and Higher Loop Corrections in Single Field Inflation with PBHs Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the action and the interaction Hamiltonians to all orders in perturbation theory in the model of single field inflation with a transient ultra slow-roll phase. Employing the formalism of EFT of inflation, we obtain a compact non-perturbative expression for the interaction Hamiltonian in terms of the Goldstone field $\pi$ in the decoupling limit. In addition, we also present a non-linear relation between $\pi$ and the curvature perturbations to all orders in perturbation theory. These are powerful results which enable us to calculate the cosmological correlators and loop corrections to any order in perturbation theory. As a non-trivial example, we calculate the $L$-loop corrections on long CMB scale perturbations in the USR models which are used for PBHs formation. We show that the loop corrections scale like $(\Delta N {\cal P}_e L) ^L$ in which ${\cal P}_e$ is the peak of the power spectrum and $\Delta N$ is the duration of the USR phase. This indicates that the loop corrections grow quickly out of perturbative control for large values of $L$. In the conventional USR setup for PBHs formation with $\Delta N \simeq 2.5$, this happens at $L=4$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct a non-null torus-knotted gravitational monochromatic wave solution of the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum, employing the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) framework by analogy with classical electrodynamics. We derive the geometric objects, including the line element, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor, the Ricci scalar, and the geodesic equation for this background. Also, we investigate two properties inherent to this solution due to its GEM origin: the dual GEM potential and GEM helicity.</description>

      <title>Action, entropy and pair creation rate of charged black holes in de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12713v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute and clarify the interpretation of the on-shell Euclidean action for Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in de Sitter space. We show the on-shell action is minus the sum of the black hole and cosmological horizon entropy for arbitrary mass and charge in any number of dimensions. This unifying expression helps to clear up a confusion about the Euclidean actions of extremal and ultracold black holes in de Sitter, as they can be understood as special cases of the general expression. We then use this result to estimate the probability for the pair creation of black holes with arbitrary mass and charge in an empty de Sitter background, by employing the formalism of constrained instantons. Finally, we suggest that the decay of charged de Sitter black holes is governed by the gradient flow of the entropy function and that, as a consequence, the regime of light, superradiant, rapid charge emission should describe the potential decay of extreme charged Nariai black holes to singular geometries.</description>

Abstract: We study closed universes in holographic theories of quantum gravity. We argue that within any fixed theory, factorization implies there is one unique closed universe state. The wave function of any state that can be prepared by the path integral is proportional to the Hartle-Hawking wave function. This unique wave function depends on the properties of the underlying holographic theory such as the energy spectrum. We show these properties explicitly in JT gravity, which is known to be dual to an ensemble of random Hamiltonians. For each member of the ensemble, the corresponding wave function is erratic as a result of the spectrum being chaotic. After ensemble averaging, we obtain smooth semi-classical wave functions as well as different closed universe states.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial, and helical charges. I. Non-dissipative transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the Axial Vortical Wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. The emergence of this wave can be traced back to earlier studies of vortical chiral fluids in a hydrodynamic approach. We also point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial and helical charges. II. Dissipative effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the effect of interactions on the local, average polarization of a quantum plasma of massless fermion particles characterized by vector, axial, and helical quantum numbers. Due to the helical and axial vortical effects, perturbations in the vector charge in a rotating plasma can lead to chiral and helical charge transfer along the direction of the vorticity vector. At the same time, interactions between the plasma constituents lead to the dissipation of the helical charge through helicity-violating pair annihilation (HVPA) processes and of the axial charge through the axial anomaly. We will discuss separately a QED-like plasma, in which we ignore background electromagnetic fields and thus the axial charge is approximately conserved, as well as a QCD-like plasma, where instanton effects lead to the violation of the axial charge conservation, even in the absence of background chromomagnetic fields. The non-conservation of helicity and chirality leads to a gapping of the Helical, Axial, and mixed Axial-Helical vortical waves that prevents their infrared modes from propagating. On the other hand, usual dissipative effects, such as charge diffusion, lead to significant damping of ultraviolet modes. We end this paper with a discussion of the regimes where these vortical waves may propagate.</description>

      <title>Revisiting thermodynamic topology of Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a common vector field to study the thermodynamic topology of the Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions. Existing literature has shown that studying these two types of phase transitions typically requires defining two separate vector fields . In our approach, we adopt Duan's $\phi$-mapping topological current theory to define a novel vector field, denoted as $\phi$, whose critical points exactly correspond to the Davies point and the Hawking-Page phase transition point. More importantly, we can differentiate between these two points by their topological charge. While, the topological charge for the critical point corresponding to the Davies-type phase transition is found to be $-1$, the same for the Hawking-Page phase transition point, it is $+1$. Although our analysis is applicable to all black hole systems where both types of phase transitions are found, we illustrate it using three simple systems as examples: the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS black hole in the grand canonical ensemble, and finally the Kerr AdS black holes in the grand canonical ensemble. It is wellknown that these black holes exhibit both Davies and Hawking-Page phase transitions. With our proposed vector $\phi$, the critical points obtained for these three systems exactly match the Davies-type and Hawking-Page phase transition points, and the associated topological charges are found to be $-1$ for the Davies point and $+1$ for the Hawking-Page phase transition point.</description>

Abstract: We determine generalized symmetries for 4D theories engineered via type II strings on non-supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds $\mathbb{R}^{3,1} \times \mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$. Probe branes detect generalized symmetries via the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in an associated quiver gauge theory. In situations where the tachyons are sequestered away from the boundary $S^5 / \Gamma$, this exactly matches the result extracted from singular homology. In situations with an unsequestered tachyon which stretches out to the boundary, the presence of tachyonic pulses partitions up the space into several distinct sectors, and the net contribution again matches with the answer expected via quiver methods. For IIA backgrounds, the presence of a localized closed string tachyon leads to transitions in the spectrum of states, generalized symmetries, higher-group symmetries, as well as the level matrix of the associated symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). For IIB backgrounds with a stack of spacetime filling probe D3-branes, the onset of a radiatively generated potential leads to similar considerations involving scale dependent transitions in the symmetries of the theory, including structures such as duality defects / interfaces.</description>

      <title>Topology of restricted phase space thermodynamics in Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of the Kerr-Sen-Ads black hole in restricted phase space. In the restricted phase space, a new parameter, central charge $C$, and its conjugate parameter $\mu$ are introduced, omitting the well-known $PdV$ term in the first law of black hole thermodynamics. We study the local and global topology of the black hole by considering the black hole solution as topological defects in the free energy landscape. We compute the winding number and the total topological number at the thermodynamic defects. For our analysis, we have considered five ensembles of Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in restricted phase space: fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$, fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$, and fixed $(\phi,\Omega, C)$, where $Q$ is the electric charge, $J$ is the angular momentum, $C$ is the central charge, $\phi$ is the electric potential conjugate to charge, $\Omega$ is the angular frequency conjugate to $J$, and finally, $\mu$ is the chemical potential. In the fixed $(Q, J, C)$, fixed $(\phi, J, C)$, and fixed $(Q, J, \mu)$ ensembles, we find a topological charge of $+1$. In the fixed $(Q,\Omega, C)$ and fixed $(\phi, \Omega, C)$ ensembles, depending on the values of the thermodynamic parameters, we find topological charges of $-1$, $0$, and $+1$. Interestingly, in ensembles where we find the topological charge to be $0$, we observe both Hawking-Page and Davies type phase transitions. We show that both types of these phase transitions can be studied using a common vector field, and the topological charges associated with Davies type and Hawking-Page phase transitions are $-1$ and $+1$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently devised chiral algebra bootstrap computes the form factors of a special class of ``twistorial'' 4d QFTs as correlation functions of the theory's 2d celestial chiral algebra. Examples of twistorial theories include self-dual Yang-Mills theory coupled to special massless matter content, and certain form factors in these theories are equivalent to a subset of MHV amplitudes in massless QCD, coupled to the same matter. In this paper, we extend the chiral algebra bootstrap to include scattering in the presence of charged sources, using a self-dual dyon in a twistorial theory as our main example. Self-dual theories in the presence of such sources lift to holomorphic gauge theories on non-Hausdorff twistor space, and we generalize the Koszul duality construction of Costello and Paquette to this setting. With this approach, we easily reproduce a recent formula of Adamo, Bogna, Mason, and Sharma for $n$-point MHV scattering of gluons off the self-dual dyon.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a second realization of the Weyl double copy (WDC) in four-dimensional algebraic type D spacetime. We show that any type D vacuum solution admits an algebraically general Maxwell scalar on the curved background that squares to give the Weyl scalar. The WDC relation defines a scalar field that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation sourced by the Weyl scalar on the curved background. We then extend the type D WDC to five dimensions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

Abstract: New dilaton Weyl multiplets are constructed in four and five space-time dimensions for $N=4$ and $N=2$ conformal supergravity respectively. They are constructed from a mixture of the old dilaton weyl multiplets with an on-shell vector multiplet. The old dilaton Weyl multiplets have a $USp(4)$ R-symmetry group whereas the new multiplets have $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ R-symmetry, which is a subgroup of $USp(4)$. In six dimensions, for the first time we construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $(2,0)$ conformal supergravity from a mixture of the standard Weyl multiplet and a tensor multiplet. The R-symmetry group for the dilaton Weyl multiplet in six dimensions is also $SU(2)\times SU(2)$.</description>

Abstract: We study an $O(N)$ invariant surface defect in the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory (CFT) in $d=4-\epsilon$ dimensions. This defect is defined by mass deformation on a two-dimensional surface that generates localized disorder and is conjectured to factorize into a pair of ordinary boundary conditions in $d=3$. We determine defect CFT data associated with the lightest $O(N)$ singlet and vector operators up to the third order in the $\epsilon$-expansion, find agreements with results from numerical methods and provide support for the factorization proposal in $d=3$. Along the way, we observe surprising non-renormalization properties for surface anomalous dimensions and operator-product-expansion coefficients in the $\epsilon$-expansion. We also analyze the full conformal anomalies for the surface defect.</description>

      <title>The Fuzzball Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the puzzles that arise in the quantum theory of black holes, and explain how they are resolved in string theory. We review how the Bekenstein entropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the classical horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region to establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational vacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the large degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2109.00065, it was pointed out that superstring theory on $AdS_3$ with $(NS,NS)$ $B$-field background and $R_{AdS}/l_s=\sqrt k&lt;1$ is dual to a symmetric product CFT deformed by an operator in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted sector. We generalize the analysis of arXiv:2109.00065 to $k&gt;1$, and show that the resulting picture matches that discussed in the bosonic case in arXiv:2110.07535. We argue that in the critical case, $k=1$ hep-th/0503121, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ twisted deformation remains non-trivial. This resolves some confusions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of splitting of the chiral and deconfinement transition due to rotation in QCD: the phase diagram of linear sigma model coupled to Polyakov loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of rigid rotation on the critical temperatures of deconfinement and chiral transitions in the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and the Polyakov loop. We point out the essential role of the causality condition, which requires that any point of the system should rotate slower than the velocity of light. We show that imposing this physical requirement leads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining transitions, which becomes negligibly small ({\Delta}T ~ 1 MeV or less) for experimentally relevant, slow angular velocities {\Omega} ~ 10 MeV of a 5-10 fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much bigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting reaches 10 MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature splitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of ultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at near-to-light velocities.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>The spin-one Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation revisited: analytical study of its structure and a careful choice of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation is investigated for spin one bosons with the so-called natural (normal) and unnatural (abnormal) parity states for non-minimal vector interactions. To illustrate the current state of knowledge about the equation, a thorough but concise discussion is made on what can be achieved analytically within this framework for well-known phenomenological interactions, including Coulomb, soft-core, Cornell, Kratzer, and exponential type interactions. In the non-exponential cases, the equation, depending on the chosen interaction, is studied in relation to the confluent, doubly-confluent, and biconfluent Heun functions. Furthermore, to show the need for careful treatment of various parity states, a Kratzer-type potential, such as a generalized Coulomb interaction, is discussed in depth using the Lie algebraic approach, showing the need for careful analysis of abnormal parity states in a fairly explicit way. The energies obtained are discussed using some figures to explicitly show the different regimes, as well as the absence of the Klein paradox. Finally, some directions for future work that would undoubtedly need to be explored in this field are discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Shadows of Black Holes in $f(R,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore two $f(R,T)$ gravity models and derive black hole solutions within these models. We focus on investigating how the $f(R,T)$ model influences the thermodynamic characteristics of black holes by studying their thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry. We consider five specific values of the thermodynamic parameter $\omega$, which signify five different classes of black hole solutions in general relativity (GR). We observe significant changes in the local topological properties of these black holes compared to GR, depending on the model parameters. Notably, we identify an additional topological class $W=0$ for some values of $\omega$ that is absent in the GR framework. We also study the thermodynamic geometry of the black hole using the Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) formalism. Our analysis demonstrates that the singular point, where the GTD scalar curvature diverges, corresponds exactly to the point where the heat capacity changes sign. Additionally, we constrain the model parameters of both models considered by utilizing black hole shadow data from the Sgr A* black hole, measured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).</description>

      <title>Holographic View of Mixed-State Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a holographic duality between d-dimensional mixed-state symmetry-protected topological phases (mSPTs) and (d+1)-dimensional subsystem symmetry-protected topological states (SSPTs). Specifically, we show that the reduced density matrix of the boundary layer of a (d+1)-dimensional SSPT with subsystem symmetry S and global symmetry G corresponds to a d-dimensional mSPT with strong S and weak G symmetries. Conversely, we demonstrate that the wavefunction of an SSPT can be constructed by replicating the density matrix of the corresponding lower-dimensional mSPT. This mapping links the density matrix in lower dimensions to the entanglement properties of higher-dimensional wavefunctions, providing an approach for analyzing nonlinear quantities and quantum information metrics in mixed-state systems. Our duality offers a new perspective for studying intrinsic mSPTs that are unique to open quantum systems, without pure state analogs. We show that strange correlators and twisted R\'enyi-N correlators can diagnose these nontrivial phases and explore their connection to strange correlators in pure-state SSPTs. Furthermore, we discuss several implications of this holographic duality, including a method for preparing intrinsic mSPT states through the duality.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Horndeski gravity and the ultra slowly evaporating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evaporation behaviors of asymptotically flat charged black holes in the Einstein-Horndeski gravity theory. Based on the thermodynamics of the Horndeski black hole, we present a physical understanding of the scalar charge of the Horndeski black hole and also clarify its connection to the Einstein vector theory. As the presence of non-minimal coupling, the evaporating behaviors of the Horndeski black hole are vastly different from the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) black hole case. Due to the different spacetime and electric field structures, the evaporation rate of the Horndeski black hole will slow down at the late stage of evaporation and thus gain a lifetime much longer than the RN black hole. These results illuminate the effect of non-minimally coupled matters on the black hole evaporation and provide clues to search for these matter fields in future observations.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers of analogue black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers quantify the conservative static response of compact objects to external tidal fields, and are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity. Many aspects of the physics of black holes have an analogue in the theory of supersonic acoustic flows, including the existence of an event horizon and associated phenomena, such as quasinormal modes and superradiance. In this paper, we investigate the tidal Love numbers of acoustic black holes in different number of dimensions. We find that they exhibit a number of similar properties as higher-dimensional general relativistic black holes, such as logarithmic running with radial distance, and vanishing tidal response for special multipole moments. We show that the latter is a consequence of ladder symmetries, analogous to those identified for black holes.</description>

      <title>How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only low-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle possible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations, these generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in lower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation. With this in mind, we consider the phenomenologically well-motivated scenario given by adding a single Majorana field in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ \textit{and nothing else}. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory in general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the (known) string landscape. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds on this class of scenarios. Improved limits from future colliders and dark matter detection experiments provide additional routes to potentially falsifying string theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic inflation and holographic dark energy from entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the entropy of anti-de Sitter black hole, a new holographic dark energy model has been proposed. When the Hubble horizon and particle horizon are chosen as the IR cutoff, the late-time accelerated expansion of universe is realized. In this paper, we consider the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff to investigate holographic inflation and slow-roll inflation in this model. We find that slow-roll inflation with the chaotic potential $V_{0}\phi^{n}$ is favored by Planck results for some special cases, such as $n=1/3$ and $n=1/2$, while holographic inflation is not supported by Planck results. Then, we analyze the reheating temperature and the number of reheating e-folds in this model, and we find that the results favor the cases $n=1/3$ and $n=1/2$. Finally, we use the dynamical analysis method, statefinder diagnostic pairs, and the Hubble diagram to analyze this model. Our results indicate that when $b^{2}$ takes a small value, this model cannot be distinguished from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and can serve as an alternative to it.</description>

      <title>Resumming Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian gravitational waveform expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waveform emitted by a particle moving in a Schwarzschild geometry can be computed, in perturbation theory, as a double series expansion in the limit where distances are large with respect to the size of the horizon, $z=2M/r\ll 1$ (Post-Minkowskian approximation), but small with respect to the gravitational wavelength, $y=2{\rm i} \omega r\ll 1$ (Post-Newtonian approximation). While in the case of bounded systems the two expansions are linked, for scattering processes they describe complementary regions of spacetime. In this paper, we derive all order formulae for those two expansions of the waveform, where the entire dependence on the $y$ or $z$ variables is resummed under the assumption $\omega M\ll 1$. The results are based on a novel hypergeometric representation of the confluent Heun functions and provide a new derivation of the recently discovered Heun connection formulae. Similar results are found for the non-confluent Heun case. Finally, in the case of circular orbits we compute our formulae at order 30PN and show excellent agreement against solutions obtained via numerical integrations and the MST method.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) and topological codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds corresponding to high-dimensional topological expanders from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation with only a constant qubit overhead. This suggests that qLDPC or more generally CSS codes obtained from product constructions are topological, and hence can admit cohomology operations such as cup products, physically corresponding to higher symmetries in the underlying topological quantum field theory. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain the first non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources (`magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>
