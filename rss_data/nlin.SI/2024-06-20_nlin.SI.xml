      <title>Lagrangian multiform structure of discrete and semi-discrete KP systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variational structure for the potential AKP system is established using the novel formalism of a Lagrangian multiforms. The structure comprises not only the fully discrete equation on the 3D lattice, but also its semi-discrete variants including several differential-difference equations asssociated with, and compatible with, the partial difference equation. To this end, an overview is given of the various (discrete and semi-discrete) variants of the KP system, and their associated Lax representations, including a novel `generating PDE' for the KP hierarchy. The exterior derivative of the Lagrangian 3-form for the lattice potential KP equation is shown to exhibit a double-zero structure, which implies the corresponding generalised Euler-Lagrange equations. Alongside the 3-form structures, we develop a variational formulation of the corresponding Lax systems via the square eigenfunction representation arising from the relevant direct linearization scheme.</description>

      <title>The Riemann-Hilbert approach for the nonlocal derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the nonlocal reverse space-time derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation under nonzero boundary conditions is investigated using the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach. The direct scattering problem focuses on the analyticity, symmetries, and asymptotic behaviors of the Jost eigenfunctions and scattering matrix functions, leading to the construction of the corresponding RH problem. Then, in the inverse scattering problem, the Plemelj formula is employed to solve the RH problem. So the reconstruction formula, trace formulae, $\theta$ condition, and exact expression of the single-pole and double-pole solutions are obtained. Furthermore, dark-dark solitons, bright-dark solitons, and breather solutions of the reverse space-time derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation are presented along with their dynamic behaviors summarized through graphical simulation.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic breathing dromion-like structures in an anisotropic ferromagnetic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of Gilbert damping on the propagation of electromagnetic waves (EMWs) in an anisotropic ferromagnetic medium is investigated theoretically. The interaction of the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic wave with the magnetization of a ferromagnetic medium has been studied by solving the associated Maxwell's equations coupled with a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. When small perturbations are made on the magnetization of the ferromagnetic medium and magnetic field along the direction of propagation of electromagnetic wave by using the reductive perturbation method, the associated nonlinear dynamics is governed by a time-dependent damped derivative nonlinear Schrodinger (TDDNLS) equation. The Lagrangian density function is constructed by using the variational method to solve the TDDNLS equation to understand the dynamics of the system under consideration. The propagation of EMW in a ferromagnetic medium with inherent Gilbert damping admits very interesting nonlinear dynamical structures. These structures include Gilbert damping-managing symmetrically breathing solitons, localized erupting electromagnetic breathing dromion-like modes of excitations, breathing dromion-like soliton, decaying dromion-like modes and an unexpected creation-annihilation mode of excitations in the form of growing-decaying dromion-like modes.</description>

      <title>Integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Extensions of the Liouville and Sinh-Gordon Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general framework to construct integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of classical, two-dimensional Toda and conformal affine Toda theories. The scheme is applied to define the extended Liouville and Sinh-Gordon models; they are based on $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color Lie algebras and their fields satisfy a parabosonic statististics. The mathematical tools here introduced are the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded covariant extensions of the Lax pair formalism and of the Polyakov's soldering procedure. The $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Sinh-Gordon model is derived from an affine $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded color Lie algebra, mimicking a procedure originally introduced by Babelon-Bonora to derive the ordinary Sinh-Gordon model. The color Lie algebras under considerations are: the $6$-generator $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $sl_2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded affine ${\widehat{sl_2}}$ algebra with two central extensions, the $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Virasoro algebra obtained from a Hamiltonian reduction.</description>
