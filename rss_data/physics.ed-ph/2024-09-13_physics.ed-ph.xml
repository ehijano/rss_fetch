      <title>A Conceptual Framework for Understanding Empathy in Physics Faculty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics, like many scientific disciplines, has long struggled with attracting and retaining a diverse population and fostering inclusivity. While there have been improvements in addressing equity issues within physics, significant challenges remain. Faculty members play a crucial role as change agents in promoting cultural transformation within academic environments. Empathy, a fundamental component of effective teaching, mentoring, and collegiality, is essential for fostering a student-centered and holistic approach in academia. However, understanding how empathy functions within the specific context of physics, including its interaction with power dynamics and other contextual factors, remains underexplored.This study presents a theoretical model of empathy development among physics faculty as they engage with students and colleagues. Conducted at a private R2 institution, the study involved four rounds of interviews from summer 2023 to spring 2024. The initial two rounds (summer 2023) included eight participants, followed by 19 participants in fall 2023, and nine participants chose to follow up with us in spring 2024. All participants were physics faculty members, either in teaching or tenure-track positions. The developed model builds on previous research by introducing new complexities in the understanding of empathy. It identifies key mediators, including reflective witnessing, personal experiences, and empathetic concern, as well as moderators such as individual experience, emotions, motivation, values, and situational information. The model delineates both cognitive and affective pathways of empathy, providing a nuanced framework for understanding how empathy develops and influences faculty interactions in the physics discipline.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Design--Science Connection in a multi-week Engineering Design (ED)-based introductory physics laboratory task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reform documents advocate for innovative pedagogical strategies to enhance student learning. A key innovation is the integration of science and engineering practices through Engineering Design (ED)-based physics laboratory tasks, where students tackle engineering design problems by applying physics principles. While this approach has its benefits, research shows that students do not always effectively apply scientific concepts, but instead rely on trial-and-error approaches, and end up gadgeteering their way to a solution. This leads to what is commonly referred to as the "design-science gap" -- that students do not always consciously apply science concepts while solving a design problem. However, as obvious as the notion of a `gap' may appear, there seems to exist no consensus on the definitions of `design' and `science', further complicating the understanding of this `gap'. This qualitative study addresses the notion of the design-science gap by examining student-groups' discussions and written lab reports from a multi-week ED-based undergraduate introductory physics laboratory task. Building on our earlier studies, we developed and employed a nuanced, multi-layered coding scheme inspired by the Gioia Framework to characterize `design thinking' and `science thinking'. We discuss how student-groups engage in various aspects of design and how they apply concepts physics principles to solve the problem. In the process, we demonstrate the interconnectedness of students' design thinking and science thinking. We advocate for the usage of the term ``design--science connection'' as opposed to ``design--science gap'' to deepen both design and scientific thinking. Our findings offer valuable insights for educators in design-based science education.</description>
