      <title>Observation of Charge Enhancement in forward-biased neutron-irradiated 4H-SiC PiN Detectors in UV-TCT Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the increased commercial availability, wide-bandgap semiconductors and their radiation hardness have recently received increased interest from the particle physics community. 4H-Silicon Carbide (SiC), especially, is an attractive candidate for future radiation-hard detectors which do not require cooling.
  This paper investigates the radiation hardness of 4H-SiC p-in-n detectors irradiated up to $5\times 10^{15}$ $\text{n}_{\text{eq.}}/\text{cm}^2$ using UV-TCT. The samples have been operated in reverse and forward bias, which is possible due to the heavily decreased forward current after irradiation. Previous studies have already hinted at an excessive charge collection in forward bias, even exceeding a charge collection efficiency (CCE) of 100%. In this work, the excessive CCE in forward bias was shown to correlate heavily with the spatial profile of injected charge. For a sufficiently focused laser, the CCE starts to increase at high forward bias and even surpasses 100% instead of saturating as it does for a defocused laser beam. In reverse bias, the CCE was found to be independent of the beam spot size. For samples irradiated to high fluences ($\geq 1\times 10^{15}$ $\text{n}_{\text{eq.}}/\text{cm}^2$) the excessive CCE in forward bias is smaller and negligible at the highest fluences.
  Additionally, the CCE was observed to correlate to the rate of charge injection (laser pulses per second), with a logarithmic increase of the collected charge if a threshold of injected carrier density is exceeded. The mechanism of these effects is still an ongoing topic of study, however, the observations already pose implications for the accurate experimental characterization of irradiated SiC detectors.</description>

      <title>Temperature-induced hysteretic behavior of resistivity and magnetoresistance of electrodeposited bismuth films for X- ray transition-edge sensor absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the temperature-induced hysteretic behavior of resistivity and magnetoresistance in electrodeposited bismuth films, with a focus on their application as absorbers in transition-edge sensors (TESs) for X-ray detection. Through a series of resistance versus temperature measurements from room temperature to a few Kelvins, we explore the change in the conductive behavior of bismuth electrodeposited on various substrates at the various temperatures. Our findings show for the first time both hysteretic and irreversible changes in resistivity as a function of temperature. Further, magnetoresistance measurements reveal notable variations in resistance behavior under different magnetic fields, highlighting the impact of magnetic fields on these films' electronic transport properties, with an indication of potential weak anti-localization effects at the lowest temperatures. This study not only provides a deeper understanding of bismuth's conductivity characteristics at low temperatures but also sheds light on the practical implications for developing more effective TESs for synchrotron X-ray facilities.</description>

      <title>Germanium target sensed by phonon-mediated kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic phonon detectors are adopted in experiments searching for dark matter interactions or coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, thanks to the low energy threshold they can achieve. The phonon-mediated sensing of particle interactions in passive silicon absorbers has been demonstrated with Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs). Targets with neutron number larger than silicon, however, feature higher cross section to neutrinos while multi-target absorbers in dark matter experiments would provide a stronger evidence of a possible signal. In this work we present the design, fabrication and operation of KIDs coupled to a germanium absorber, achieving phonon-sensing performance comparable to silicon absorbers. The device introduced in this work is a proof of concept for a scalable neutrino detector and for a multi-target dark matter experiment.</description>

      <title>Testbeam Characterization of a SiGe BiCMOS Monolithic Silicon Pixel Detector with Internal Gain Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monolithic silicon pixel ASIC prototype, produced in 2024 as part of the Horizon 2020 MONOLITH ERC Advanced project, was tested with a 120 GeV/c pion beam. The ASIC features a matrix of hexagonal pixels with a 100 \mu m pitch, read by low-noise, high-speed front-end electronics built using 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology. It includes the PicoAD sensor, which employs a continuous, deep PN junction to generate avalanche gain. Data were taken across power densities from 0.05 to 2.6 W/cm2 and sensor bias voltages from 90 to 180 V. At the highest bias voltage, corresponding to an electron gain of 50, and maximum power density, an efficiency of (99.99 \pm 0.01)% was achieved. The time resolution at this working point was (24.3 \pm 0.2) ps before time-walk correction, improving to (12.1 \pm 0.3) ps after correction.</description>

      <title>An instrument to link global positioning to the Universe -- Observing GNSS satellites with the Australian VLBI array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>Impact of Device Resistances in the Performance of Graphene-based Terahertz Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graphene Field-Effect-Transistors (GFETs) have demonstrated an outstanding potential for Terahertz (THz) photodetection due to their fast response and high-sensitivity. Such features are essential to enable emerging THz applications, including 6G wireless communications, quantum information, bioimaging and security. However, the overall performance of these photodetectors may be utterly compromised by the impact of internal resistances presented in the device, so-called access or parasitic resistances. In this work, we provide a detailed study of the influence of internal device resistances in the photoresponse of high-mobility dual-gate GFET detectors. Such dual-gate architectures allow us to fine tune (decrease) the internal resistance of the device by an order of magnitude and consequently demonstrate an improved responsivity and noise-equivalent-power values of the photodetector, respectively. Our results can be well understood by a series resistance model, as shown by the excellent agreement found between the experimental data and theoretical calculations. These findings are therefore relevant to understand and improve the overall performance of existing high-mobility graphene photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Response of a Cold-Electron Bolometer in a coplanar antenna system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold electron bolometers have shown their suitability for use in modern fundamental physical experiments. Fabrication and measurements of the samples with cold-electron bolometers integrated into coplanar antennas are performed in this study. The bolometric layer was made using combined aluminum-hafnium technology to improve quality of aluminum oxide layer and decrease the leakage current. The samples of two types were measured in a dilution cryostat at various temperatures from 20 to 300 mK. The first sample with Ti/Au/Pd antenna shows response in the two frequency bands, at 7--9 GHz with bandwidth of about 20%, and also at 14 GHz with 10% bandwidth. The NEP below 10 aW/Hz^1/2 is reached at 300 mK for 7.7 GHz signal. The second sample with aluminum made antenna shows response in the frequency range 0.5--3 GHz due to the effect of kinetic inductance of superconducting aluminum.</description>
