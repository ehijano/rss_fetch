      <title>Fibrations on Handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the open genus 2 handlebody admits uncountably-many fibrations over the circle with fiber homeomorphic to the Cantor tree surface with non-conjugate monodromies in the mapping class group. The construction generalizes to produce uncountably many fibrations of other tame 3-manifolds with infinite type fibers, including the blooming Cantor tree and many other types of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Pointed Racks and Their Applications to Braid Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a new algebraic structure called a \emph{pointed rack} and use it to construct ambient isotopy invariants of $ n $-braids. We first introduce an integer-valued invariant of braids using pointed racks. This is then strengthened by defining a matrix-valued invariant using racks. Moreover, our invariant determines the rack coloring invariant previously defined for the closure of the braid. Finally, we include examples of braids that are distinguished by these new invariants.</description>

      <title>Existence and deformability of topological Morse functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1950s Morse defined the analogue of Morse functions for topological manifolds. In many instances, when mathematicians are using techniques on topological manifolds that appear to be Morse-theoretic in nature, there is a topological Morse function implicit in the argument. Topological Morse functions are known to inherit most of the familiar properties of the usual (smooth) Morse functions, with two crucial exceptions: existence and deformability. This paper gives a simple construction of continuous families of topological Morse functions.</description>

      <title>Linear Bound for Kakimizu Complex Diameter of Hyperbolic Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the upper bound of the diameter of the Kakimizu complex of an atoroidal knot grows linearly with the knot genus $g$. Specifically, the diameter is at most $2$ when $g = 1$, at most $6$ when $g = 2$, and at most $4g - 3$ for $g \geq 3$. This confirms a conjecture of Sakuma--Shackleton.</description>

      <title>Instanton 2-torsion and Dehn surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our earlier work on $2$-torsion in instanton Floer homology, we considered only integral surgeries on a knot $K\subset S^3$ and showed that the absence of $2$-torsion forces $K$ to be fibered. The present paper extends the result to all rational surgeries. We prove that if the framed instanton homology $I^{\sharp}(S^3_r(K);\mathbb{Z})$ is $2$-torsion-free for some $r\in \mathbb{Q}_+$, then $K$ is an instanton L-space knot and $r&gt;2g(K)-1$. Leveraging this $2$-torsion perspective, we also obtain new small-surgery obstructions: If either $S^{3}_{5}(K)$ or $S^{3}_{11/2}(K)$ is $SU(2)$-abelian, then $K$ must be the unknot or the right-handed trefoil. This result sharpens the small-$SU(2)$-abelian surgery theorems of Kronheimer--Mrowka, Baldwin--Sivek, and Baldwin--Li--Sivek--Ye.</description>

      <title>A note on the Nielsen realization problem for Enriques manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a numerical criterion for the Nielsen realization problem for Enriques manifolds, based on the recent developments on the Birman-Hilden theory for hyper-K\"ahler manifolds and on Nielsen realization for hyper-K\"ahler manifolds. We apply the criterion to known examples of Enriques manifolds to get explicit groups that can be realized or not realized, and comment on questions related to the Nielsen realization problem.</description>

      <title>Intersection homotopy, refinements and coarsenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous works, we studied intersection homotopy groups associated to a Goresky and MacPherson perversity and a filtered space. They are defined as the homotopy groups of simplicial sets introduced by P. Gajer. We particularized to locally conical spaces of Siebenmann (called CS sets) and established a topological invariance for them when the regular part remains unchanged.
  Here, we consider coarsenings, made of two structures of CS sets on the same topological space, the strata of one being a union of strata of the other. We endow them with a general perversity and its pushforward, where the adjective ``general'' means that the perversities are defined on the poset of the strata and not only according to their codimension. If the perversity verifies a growing property analogous to that of the original perversities of Goresky and MacPherson, we also find an invariance theorem for the intersection homotopy groups of a coarsening, under the above restriction on the regular parts. An invariance is shown too in some cases where singular strata become regular in the coarsening, for Thom-Mather spaces.</description>

      <title>The twist-cofinite topology on the mapping class group of a surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.11212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A topology is defined on the mapping class group of a compact connected orientable surface. It is shown that a notion of "genericity" on subsets of the mapping class group arises from this definition. Many plausible results follow from this notion easily; for example, the set of pseudo-Anosov maps is shown to be generic, and can be assumed to have arbitrary large stretch factor, generically. Let M be a 3-manifold obtained from a Heegaard splitting of fixed genus g and generic gluing map. It is shown that for such manifolds, generically M is hyperbolic, has first Betti number zero and Heegaard genus exactly equal to g.</description>

      <title>An equivariant deformation retraction of the Thurston spine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03429v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that there is a mapping class group-equivariant deformation retraction of the Teichm\"uller space of a closed, orientable surface onto a cell complex of dimension equal to the virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group. The image of the deformation retraction is contained in the CW complex first described by Thurston -- the Thurston spine. The Thurston spine is the set of points in Teichm\"uller space corresponding to hyperbolic surfaces for which the set of shortest geodesics (the systoles) cuts the surface into polygons.</description>

      <title>Convergence of discrete conformal mappings on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete conformal mappings based on circle packing, vertex scaling, and related structures has had significant activity since Thurston proposed circle packing as a way to approximate conformal maps in the 1980s. The first convergence result of Rodin-Sullivan (1987) proved that circle packing maps do indeed converge to conformal maps to the disk. Recent results have shown convergence of maps of other discrete conformal structures to conformal maps as well. We give a general theorem of convergence of discrete conformal mappings between surfaces that allows for a variety of discrete conformal structures and manifolds with or without boundary. The mappings are a composition of piecewise linear discrete conformal mappings and Riemannian barycentric coordinates, called barycentric discrete conformal maps. Estimates of the barycentric discrete conformal maps allow extraction of convergent subsequences and estimates for the pullback of the Riemannian metric, proving conformality. The theorem requires assumptions on fullness of simplices to prevent degenerate triangles and a local discrete conformal rigidity generalizing hexagonal rigidity of circle packings.</description>
