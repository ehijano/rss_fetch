      <title>The role of parsimonious models in addressing mobility challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility is a complex phenomenon encompassing diverse transportation modes, infrastructure elements, and human behaviors. Tackling the persistent challenges of congestion, pollution, and accessibility requires a range of modeling approaches to optimize these systems. While AI offers transformative potential, it should not be the sole solution. Parsimonious models remain crucial in generating innovative concepts and tools, and fostering collaborative efforts among researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders.</description>

      <title>On Voting Process and Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this communication, we propose a tentative to set the fundamental problem of measuring process done by a large structure on a microsopic one. We consider the example of voting when an entire society tries to measure globally opinions of all social actors in order to elect a delegate. We present a quantum model to interpret an operational voting system and propose a quantum approach for grading step of Range Voting, developed by M. Balinski and R. Laraki in 2007.</description>

      <title>A dynamical model of platform choice and online segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to truly understand how social media might shape online discourses or contribute to societal polarization, we need refined models of platform choice, that is: models that help us understand why users prefer one social media platform over another. This study develops a dynamic model of platform selection, extending Social Feedback Theory by incorporating multi-agent reinforcement learning to capture how user decisions are shaped by past rewards across different platforms. A key parameter ($\mu$) in the model governs users' tendencies to either seek approval from like-minded peers or engage with opposing views. Our findings reveal that online environments can evolve into suboptimal states characterized by polarized, strongly opinionated echo chambers, even when users prefer diverse perspectives. Interestingly, this polarizing state coexists with another equilibrium, where users gravitate toward a single dominant platform, marginalizing other platforms into extremity. Using agent-based simulations and dynamical systems analysis, our model underscores the complex interplay of user preferences and platform dynamics, offering insights into how digital spaces might be better managed to foster diverse discourse.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of higher-order novelties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying how we explore the world in search of novelties is key to understand the mechanisms that can lead to new discoveries. Previous studies analyzed novelties in various exploration processes, defining them as the first appearance of an element. However, novelties can also be generated by combining what is already known. We hence define higher-order novelties as the first time two or more elements appear together, and we introduce higher-order Heaps' exponents as a way to characterize their pace of discovery. Through extensive analysis of real-world data, we find that processes with the same pace of discovery, as measured by the standard Heaps' exponent, can instead differ at higher orders. We then propose to model an exploration process as a random walk on a network in which the possible connections between elements evolve in time. The model reproduces the empirical properties of higher-order novelties, revealing how the network we explore changes over time along with the exploration process.</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>

      <title>Talking the Talk Does Not Entail Walking the Walk: On the Limits of Large Language Models in Lexical Entailment Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Verbs form the backbone of language, providing the structure and meaning to sentences. Yet, their intricate semantic nuances pose a longstanding challenge. Understanding verb relations through the concept of lexical entailment is crucial for comprehending sentence meanings and grasping verb dynamics. This work investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in recognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently devised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from two lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that the models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately good performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under different conditions. Also, utilizing few-shot prompting can enhance the models' performance. However, perfectly solving the task arises as an unmet challenge for all examined LLMs, which raises an emergence for further research developments on this topic.</description>
