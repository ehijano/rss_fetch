      <title>Paths in graphs: bounded geometry and property A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expose a class of discrete metric spaces, for which bounded geometry is equivalent to the property A of G. Yu. This class includes the coarse disjoint union of $(\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z)^n$, $n\in\mathbb N$, and consists of spaces of simple paths in a class of graphs that includes cactus graphs, with the metric defined as the number of edges in the symmetric difference of the paths. We also show that if a space in this class does not have bounded geometry then it contains a subspace of bounded geometry without property A.</description>

      <title>Stepanov theorem for mappings between metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Lipschitz maps between a metric measure space and a metric space, combining the ideas of Kirchheim's metric differentiability and Cheeger's differentiable structures leads to a Rademacher-type theorem for a notion of metric differentiability with respect to a rectifiable chart, and in this paper we prove the validity of a Stepanov-type generalization of such result under the same assumptions.</description>

      <title>Neighbors of self-affine tiles and Rauzy Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the theory of self-affine tiles and the theory of Rauzy fractals are quite different from each other, they have some common features. Both, self-affine tiles and Rauzy fractals have tiling properties and these tiling properties can be checked and described by certain graphs, so-called {\it contact graphs} and {\it neighbor graphs}. The contact graph is often quite easy to construct, but only the neighbor graph contains full information on the overlaps of the tiles in the presumed tiling. In the present paper we establish an algorithm that allows to construct the neighbor graph starting from the contact graph. Such an algorithm is already known in the case of self-affine tiles. In the present paper we give a simplified proof of this algorithm that can be extended to the case of Rauzy fractals. Our algorithms are more efficient than na\"ive algorithms for the construction of the neighbor graph.</description>

      <title>The metric Rips filtration, universal quasigeodesic cones, and hierarchically hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible, categorical framework for large-scale geometry that clarifies basic behaviour of the metric Rips filtration and streamlines some constructions in geometric group theory. The paper has two main parts. First, we develop the theory of the metric Rips filtration and its colimit in natural coarse categories: informally, we characterise when the Rips colimit produces a canonical large-scale model of a metric space and use this to prove that the quasigeodesic subcategory is closed under colimits in the coarsely Lipschitz category. We also establish adjointness properties of the Rips colimit and use them to characterise extremal metrics and universal morphisms from quasigeodesic sources.
  Second, we apply this machinery to characterise universal quasigeodesic cones via an explicit Rips-Tuple recipe. In the HHS setting this yields a concrete, canonical model of the total space: an HHS is quasi-isometric to a Rips graph of the space of coarsely consistent tuples in the product of its factor spaces. Moreover, we give a local-to-global criterion that promotes uniformly controlled, factorwise retractions to a canonical global hierarchical retraction. Because the approach is based on universal properties and uniformly controlled coarse data rather than inductive constructions, distance formulae, or hierarchy paths, it applies equally well to arbitrary families of metric spaces equipped with pairwise constraints.</description>

      <title>Preduals of metric BV spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the predual of the space of functions of bounded variation defined over a metric measure space $({\rm X},{\sf d},\mathfrak m)$ with $\mathfrak m$ finite. More specifically, for any exponent $p\in(1,\infty)$ we construct an isometric predual of the space ${\rm BV}_p({\rm X})$ of $p$-integrable functions of bounded variation, which we equip with the norm $\|f\|_{{\rm BV}_p({\rm X})}:=\|f\|_{L^p({\rm X})}+|Df|({\rm X})$. Moreover, we prove that the standard BV space ${\rm BV}({\rm X}):={\rm BV}_1({\rm X})$, which fails to have a predual for some choices of the metric measure space, does have a predual in the case where $({\rm X},{\sf d},\mathfrak m)$ is a PI space (i.e. a doubling metric measure space supporting a weak $(1,1)$-Poincar\'{e} inequality) of finite diameter. Along the way, we also develop a basic theory of BV functions in the setting of extended metric-topological measure spaces, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Geometric property (T) for box spaces and sofic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every sofic approximation of a property (T) group is approximately isomorphic to one having geometric property (T), and more generally, a box space of graphs which has boundary geometric property (T) is approximately isomorphic to one having geometric property (T). We also prove that a sequence of bounded degree graphs is approximately isomorphic to a disjoint union of expanders if and only if the Laplacian has spectral gap in the ultraproduct. Finally, we prove a local geometric criterion for geometric property (T) in the spirit of \.{Z}uk's criterion for property (T) for groups.</description>

      <title>Convex bodies with centrally symmetric sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a convex body, $n\geq 3$. We say that $K$ satisfies the Barker-Larman condition if there exists a ball $B$ in the interior of $K$ such that for every suppor hyperplane $\Pi$ of $B$, the section $\Pi \cap K$ is a centrally symmetric set.
  Barker and Larman conjectured that the Barker-Larman condition characterizes the ellipsoid. In this work we prove an special case of such conjecture, in particular, we assume that the convex body $K$ is centrally symmetric. Our main result is the following: Let $K$ be a centrally symmetric and strictly convex body, with center at $O$, and let $B$ be a ball in the interior of $K$ and not containing $O$: If $K$ satisfies the Barker-Larman condition with respect to $B$ and $B$ is suitable for $K$ (intuitively, $B$ is suitable for $K$ if the boundary of $B$ is not very close to the boundary of $K$), then $K$ is an ellipsoid.</description>
