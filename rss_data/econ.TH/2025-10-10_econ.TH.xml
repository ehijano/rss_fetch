      <title>Correlated Perfect Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a refinement of correlated equilibrium based on mediator errors, called correlated perfect equilibrium (CPE). In finite games, the set of CPE is nonempty and forms a finite union of convex sets. Like perfect equilibrium, a CPE never assigns positive probability to any weakly dominated strategy. We provide a dual representation of CPE and demonstrate how it differs from two existing refinements of correlated equilibrium--acceptable correlated equilibrium (Myerson, 1986) and perfect direct correlated equilibrium (Dhillon-Mertens, 1996)--through examples.</description>

      <title>The (No) Value of Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I provide a sufficient condition under which a principal does not benefit from committing to a mechanism in economic models represented by a maximisation problem under constraints. These problems include mechanism design, principal-agent models or sender-receiver games. In principal-agent problems, this condition holds if the agent has a finite strategy space and the principal's value function is continuous in the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Persuasion with Verifiable Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a game in which an informed sender with state-independent preferences uses verifiable messages to convince a receiver to choose an action from a finite set. We characterize the equilibrium outcomes of the game and compare them with commitment outcomes in information design. We provide conditions under which a commitment outcome is an equilibrium outcome and identify environments in which the sender does not benefit from commitment power. Our findings offer insights into the interchangeability of verifiability and commitment in applied settings.</description>

      <title>From tug-of-war to Brownian Boost: explicit ODE solutions for player-funded stochastic-differential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian Boost is a one-parameter family of stochastic differential games played on the real line in which players spend at rates of their choosing in an ongoing effort to influence the drift of a randomly diffusing point particle~$X$. One or other player is rewarded, at time infinity, according to whether~$X$ tends to plus or minus infinity. Each player's net receipt is the final reward (only for the victor) minus the player's total spend. We characterise and explicitly compute the time-homogeneous Markov-perfect Nash equilibria of Brownian Boost, finding the derivatives of the players' expected payoffs to solve a pair of coupled first-order non-linear ODE. Brownian Boost is a high-noise limit of a two-dimensional family of player-funded tug-of-war games, one of which was studied in~\cite{LostPennies}. We analyse the discrete games, finding them, and Brownian Boost, to exemplify key features studied in the economics literature of tug-of-war initiated by~\cite{HarrisVickers87}: a battlefield region where players spend heavily;
  stakes that decay rapidly but asymmetrically in distance to the battlefield; and an effect of discouragement that makes equilibria fragile under asymmetric perturbation of incentive.
  Tug-of-war has a parallel mathematical literature derived from~\cite{PSSW09}, which solved the scaled fair-coin game in a Euclidean domain via the infinity Laplacian PDE. By offering an analytic solution to Brownian Boost, a game that models strategic interaction and resource allocation, we seek to build a bridge between the two tug-of-war literatures.</description>

      <title>Strategyproofness-Exposing Descriptions of Matching Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A menu description exposes strategyproofness by presenting a mechanism to player $i$ in two steps. Step (1) uses others' reports to describe $i$'s menu of potential outcomes. Step (2) uses $i$'s report to select $i$'s favorite outcome from her menu. We provide novel menu descriptions of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) and Top Trading Cycles (TTC) matching mechanisms. For TTC, our description additionally yields a proof of the strategyproofness of TTC's traditional description, in a way that we prove is impossible for DA.</description>

      <title>Robust Price Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of third-degree price discrimination where the seller's product valuation is unknown to the market designer, who aims to maximize buyer surplus by revealing buyer valuation information. Our main result shows that the regret is bounded by a $\frac{1}{e}$-fraction of the optimal buyer surplus when the seller has zero valuation for the product. This bound is attained by randomly drawing a seller valuation and applying the segmentation of Bergemann et al. (2015) with respect to the drawn valuation. We show that this bound is tight in the case of binary buyer valuation.</description>

      <title>Allocating Positional Goods: A Mechanism Design Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal allocation of positional goods in the presence of externalities arising from consumers' concerns about relative consumption. Applications include luxury goods, priority services, education, and organizational hierarchies. Using a mechanism-design approach, I characterize the set of feasible allocations through a majorization condition. The revenue-maximizing mechanism possibly excludes some buyers and fully separates participants under Myerson's regularity condition. The seller can guarantee at least half the maximum revenue by offering a single good. Without exclusion, offering more levels of goods decreases (increases) consumer surplus under increasing (decreasing) failure rates. Higher participation raises consumer surplus under increasing failure rates.</description>

      <title>Cued to Queue: Information in Waiting-Line Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of providing information to agents who queue before a scarce good is distributed at a fixed time. Many information policies reveal "sudden bad news," when agents learn the queue is longer than previously believed. Sudden bad news causes assortative inefficiency by prompting multiple agents to simultaneously join the queue. If the value distribution has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate, information policies that release sudden bad news increase (decrease) total surplus, relative to releasing no information. If agents incur entry costs and the hazard rate is decreasing, the optimal policy reveals only when the queue is full.</description>

      <title>Markets for Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the prevalence of prediction problems in the economy, we study markets in which firms sell models to a consumer to help improve their prediction. Firms decide whether to enter, choose models to train on their data, and set prices. The consumer can purchase multiple models and use a weighted average of the models bought. Market outcomes can be expressed in terms of the \emph{bias-variance decompositions} of the models that firms sell. We give conditions when symmetric firms will choose different modeling techniques, e.g., each using only a subset of available covariates. We also show firms can choose inefficiently biased models or inefficiently costly models to deter entry by competitors.</description>

      <title>Interactions across multiple games: cooperation, corruption, and organizational design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is socially beneficial for teams to cooperate in some situations (``good games'') and not in others (``bad games;'' e.g., those that allow for corruption). A team's cooperation in any given game depends on expectations of cooperation in future iterations of both good and bad games. We identify when sustaining cooperation on good games necessitates cooperation on bad games. We then characterize how a designer should optimally assign workers to teams and teams to tasks that involve varying arrival rates of good and bad games. Our results show how organizational design can be used to promote cooperation while minimizing corruption.</description>
