      <title>Attention-Enhanced Convolutional Autoencoder and Structured Delay Embeddings for Weather Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather prediction is a quintessential problem involving the forecasting of a complex, nonlinear, and chaotic high-dimensional dynamical system. This work introduces an efficient reduced-order modeling (ROM) framework for short-range weather prediction and investigates fundamental questions in dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of such systems. Unlike recent AI-driven models, which require extensive computational resources, our framework prioritizes efficiency while achieving reasonable accuracy. Specifically, a ResNet-based convolutional autoencoder augmented by block attention modules is developed to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional weather data. Subsequently, a linear operator is learned in the time-delayed embedding of the latent space to efficiently capture the dynamics. Using the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, we demonstrate that this framework performs well in-distribution as evidenced by effectively predicting weather patterns within training data periods. We also identify important limitations in generalizing to future states, particularly in maintaining prediction accuracy beyond the training window. Our analysis reveals that weather systems exhibit strong temporal correlations that can be effectively captured through linear operations in an appropriately constructed embedding space, and that projection error rather than inference error is the main bottleneck. These findings shed light on some key challenges in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems and point toward opportunities for hybrid approaches that combine efficient reduced-order models as baselines with more sophisticated AI architectures, particularly for applications in long-term climate modeling where computational efficiency is paramount.</description>

      <title>MMWSTM-ADRAN+: A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Enhanced Climate Time Series Forecasting and Extreme Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate short-range prediction of extreme air temperature events remains a fundamental challenge in operational climate-risk management. We present Multi-Modal Weather State Transition Model with Anomaly-Driven Recurrent Attention Network Plus (MMWSTM-ADRAN+), a dual-stream deep learning architecture that couples a regime-aware dynamics model with an anomaly-focused attention mechanism to forecast daily maximum temperature and its extremes. The first stream, MMWSTM, combines bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) units with a learnable Markov state transition matrix to capture synoptic-scale weather regime changes. The second stream, ADRAN, integrates bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs), multi-head self-attention, and a novel anomaly amplification layer to enhance sensitivity to low-probability signals. A lightweight attentive fusion gate adaptively determines the contribution of each stream to the final prediction. Model optimization employs a custom ExtremeWeatherLoss function that up-weights errors on the upper 5% and lower 5% of the temperature distribution, and a time-series data augmentation suite (jittering, scaling, time/magnitude warping) that effectively quadruples the training data</description>

      <title>Emulation with uncertainty quantification of regional sea-level change caused by the Antarctic Ice Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projecting sea-level change in various climate-change scenarios typically involves running forward simulations of the Earth's gravitational, rotational and deformational (GRD) response to ice mass change, which requires high computational cost and time. Here we build neural-network emulators of sea-level change at 27 coastal locations, due to the GRD effects associated with future Antarctic Ice Sheet mass change over the 21st century. The emulators are based on datasets produced using a numerical solver for the static sea-level equation and published ISMIP6-2100 ice-sheet model simulations referenced in the IPCC AR6 report. We show that the neural-network emulators have an accuracy that is competitive with baseline machine learning emulators. In order to quantify uncertainty, we derive well-calibrated prediction intervals for simulated sea-level change via a linear regression postprocessing technique that uses (nonlinear) machine learning model outputs, a technique that has previously been applied to numerical climate models. We also demonstrate substantial gains in computational efficiency: a feedforward neural-network emulator exhibits on the order of 100 times speedup in comparison to the numerical sea-level equation solver that is used for training.</description>

      <title>Appa: Bending Weather Dynamics with Latent Diffusion Models for Global Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has advanced weather forecasting, but accurate predictions first require identifying the current state of the atmosphere from observational data. In this work, we introduce Appa, a score-based data assimilation model generating global atmospheric trajectories at 0.25\si{\degree} resolution and 1-hour intervals. Powered by a 565M-parameter latent diffusion model trained on ERA5, Appa can be conditioned on arbitrary observations to infer plausible trajectories, without retraining. Our probabilistic framework handles reanalysis, filtering, and forecasting, within a single model, producing physically consistent reconstructions from various inputs. Results establish latent score-based data assimilation as a promising foundation for future global atmospheric modeling systems.</description>

      <title>NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21020v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term, high-fidelity simulation of slow-changing physical systems, such as the ocean and climate, presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Reduced-Order Surrogate Models Applied to Cloud Microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional physical systems but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure. Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics, reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty across the ROM pipeline.</description>

      <title>Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds &amp; Tropical Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.</description>
