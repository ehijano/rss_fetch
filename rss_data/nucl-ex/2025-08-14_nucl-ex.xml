      <title>Coulomb excitation of $^{124}$Te: Emerging collectivity and persisting seniority structure in the $6_1^+$ level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-lying energy spectra of even-even tellurium isotopes near midshell have long been interpreted as `textbook' examples of vibrational collective motion. However, in many cases electric-quadrupole observables, which are a particularly sensitive probe of collectivity, remain undetermined. Coulomb-excitation measurements were performed to measure transition strengths connecting the ground and low-excitation states in $^{124}$Te. This isotope lies at a transitional point between collective structure near the neutron midshell and seniority structures near the $N=82$ shell. A transition strength, $B(E2; 6_1^+ \to 4_1^+)$, of 27(9)~W.u. was measured for the $6^+_1\rightarrow4^+_1$ transition for the first time in this nucleus; this value is significantly below that expected for a spherical vibrator, as well as other collective models. We examine the transition strengths in $^{124}$Te and its neighbors by comparison with large-basis shell-model calculations and by comparison with General Collective Model (GCM) fits. A GCM description of $^{120}$Te agrees with experimental $E2$ transition strengths, but no comparable description of $^{124}$Te is possible with the GCM. In contrast, there is remarkably good agreement between the $B(E2; 6_1^+ \to 4_1^+)$ values and shell-model calculations for $^{124-134}$Te. It appears that, despite approaching midshell, $^{124}$Te retains a seniority structure for the $6^+_1$ level, i.e. a significant $\pi 0g_{7/2}^2$ contribution. This persistence of the shell structure at the $6^+_1$ state is in contrast to the $B(E2)$ values of the lower-excitation $2^+_1$ and $4^+_1$ states in $^{124}$Te, and neighboring $^{120}$Te and $^{122}$Te, for which the collectivity becomes enhanced as more neutrons are removed from $N=82$.</description>

      <title>First direct access to the $\rho^0$p interaction via correlation studies at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct measurements of the $\rho^0$p interaction have remained so far elusive, with most insights derived indirectly from photoproduction or low-energy partial wave analyses. This letter presents the first direct observation of the $\rho^0$p interaction, obtained through two-particle correlations measured in high-multiplicity, ultrarelativistic proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. Two-particle correlation data, analyzed within chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) using a coupled-channel approach and incorporating recent $\phi$-p data, yield a scattering length of $a_{\rho^0p} = (-0.46 \pm 0.04) + i(0.20 \pm 0.04)$ fm and constrain coupling strengths of two states identified with the N(1958) and N(1700). These findings emphasize the importance of coupled-channel dynamics and dynamically generated states in understanding the $\rho^0$p interaction. The results establish a vacuum baseline for extrapolation studies to high densities, contributing to the foundation for chiral symmetry restoration searches, and offer collider-based insights into the QCD spectrum, complementing traditional low-energy approaches. This work marks a significant advance in correlation studies, extending the exploration of interactions to the most short-lived QCD states.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Power Week 2023: Clustering in Hadronic Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both high-energy physics and industry applications, a crowd-sourced approach to difficult problems is becoming increasingly common. These innovative approaches are ideal for the development of future facilities where the simulations can be publicly distributed, such as the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). In this paper, we discuss a so-called ``Power Week" where graduate students were able to learn about machine learning while also contributing to an unsolved problem at a future facility. Here, the problem of interest was the clustering of the forward hadronic calorimeter in the foreseen electron-proton/ion collider experiment (ePIC) detector at the EIC. The different possible approaches, developed over the course of a single week, and their performance are detailed and summarised. Feedback on the format of the week and recommendations for future similar programs are provided in the hopes to inspire future learning opportunities for students that also serve as a crowd-sourced approaches to unsolved problems.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of $\Xi_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first measurement at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) of the production yield of the strange-charm baryons $\Xi_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ as a function of charged-particle multiplicity in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC is reported. The $\Xi_c^+$ baryon is reconstructed via the $\Xi_c^+ \rightarrow \Xi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ decay channel in the range $4 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 12$ GeV/$c$, while the $\Xi_c^0$ baryon is reconstructed via both the $\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-\pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-e^+\nu_e$ decay channels in the range $2 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 12$ GeV/$c$. The baryon-to-meson ($\Xi_c^{0,+}/D^0$) and the baryon-to-baryon ($\Xi_c^{0,+}/\Lambda_c^+$) production yield ratios show no significant dependence on multiplicity. In addition, the observed yield ratios are not described by theoretical predictions that model charm-quark fragmentation based on measurements at $e^+e^-$ and $e^-$p colliders, indicating differences in the charm-baryon production mechanism in pp collisions. A comparison with different event generators and tunings, including different modelling of the hadronisation process, is also discussed. Moreover, the branching-fraction ratio of BR($\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-e^+\nu_e$)/BR($\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-\pi^+$) is measured as 0.825 $\pm$ 0.094 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.081 (syst.). This value supersedes the previous ALICE measurement, improving the statistical precision by a factor of 1.6.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ Exact Calculation of Strongly-Correlated Nucleonic Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense nucleonic matter is of vital importance for understanding compact stars and inferring the transition into deconfined quark phase. We present the $\textit{ab initio}$ exact calculations of infinite nucleonic matter with the state-of-the-art full configuration-interaction quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method, enabling us to rigorously benchmark many-body methods and assess the degree to which the nucleonic matter is strongly correlated. This method has been numerically testified to exact diagonalization within a small basis. Calculations of nucleonic matter using the chiral nuclear forces reveal that the symmetric nuclear matter is strikingly strongly correlated than expected, raising questions on previous $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations of nuclear matter with truncations and offering insights into simultaneous descriptions of finite nuclei and infinite nucleonic matter from first principles.</description>

      <title>Extracting temperature of plasma through fusion reactions within a transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the method of extracting the temperature from weighted proton-to-neutron yield ratio from fusion reactions as in the previous experiment~[W. Bang, {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 055002 (2013).] using the Texas Petawatt laser beam. The Coulomb explosion of deuterium clusters is simulated based on the particle-in-cell model in a box system with periodic boundary conditions, and fusion reactions are incorporated through the stochastic method. As long as the deuteron numbers in deuterium clusters follow a log-normal distribution, the low-energy part of the final deuteron spectrum can be fitted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, while there are more deuterons in the intermediate- and high-energy region compared to a thermal distribution, and dominate the weighted yield ratio. Therefore, the effective temperature extracted from the weighted yield ratio is generally higher than that from fitting the final deuteron spectrum. The local density fluctuation, which intrinsically exists due to the log-normal distribution of deuteron numbers, further enhances hot deuteron-deuteron collisions, and significantly affects the weighted yield ratio.</description>

      <title>Deeply virtual $\phi$-meson production near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss exclusive $\phi$-meson electroproduction off the proton near threshold within the GPD factorization framework. We propose the `threshold approximation' in which only the leading term of the conformal partial wave expansion of the meson production amplitudes is kept in both the quark and gluon exchange channels. We test the validity of this approximation to next-to-leading order in QCD and demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the cross section to the gluon and strangeness gravitational form factors. We also perform realistic event generator simulations both for Jefferson Lab and EIC kinematics and demonstrate the capabilities of future facilities for measuring near-threshold $\phi$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Atomic Charge State and Atomic Number for VAMOS++ Magnetic Spectrometer using Deep Neural Networks and Fractionally Labelled Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is a multi-parametric system that integrates ion optical magnetic elements with a multi-detector stack. The magnetic elements, along with the tracking and timing detectors and the trajectory reconstruction method, provide the analysis of the magnetic rigidity, the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer, and the related velocity and mass-over-charge ratio. The segmented ionization chamber provides the energy measurements necessary to analyze the atomic charge state and atomic number. However, this analysis critically suffers from inherent limitations due to the variable thickness and non-uniformity of the entrance window of the ionization chamber and other detector imperfections. Conventionally, this meticulous, detailed analysis is exceptionally tedious, often requiring several months to complete. We present a novel method utilizing deep neural networks, trained on an experimental dataset with only a small fraction of precisely labeled events for the lowest and best-resolved atomic charge states or numbers. This innovative approach enables the networks to autonomously and accurately classify the remaining events. This method drastically accelerates the acquisition of high-resolution atomic charge state and atomic number spectra, reducing analysis time from months to mere hours. Crucially, by discarding human bias, this approach ensures standardized, optimal, and reproducible results with unprecedented efficiency.</description>
