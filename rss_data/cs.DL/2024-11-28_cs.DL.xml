      <title>The Rn-index: a more accurate variant of the Rk-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution to pushing the boundaries of knowledge is a critical metric for evaluating the research performance of countries and institutions, which in many cases is not revealed by common bibliometric indicators. The Rk-index was specifically designed to assess such contributions, and the Rn-index is a variant that corrects the weakness of the Rk-index, particularly in the evaluation of countries that produce a high proportion of global advancements. This is the case of the USA and China in many technological fields. Additionally, the Rn-index is simple to calculate and understand, as it involves only summing the ratios between the local and global ranks of papers, ordered by their citation count. Moreover, the Rn-index may also be fractionally counted.</description>

      <title>Delineating Feminist Studies through bibliometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multidisciplinary and socially anchored nature of Feminist Studies presents unique challenges for bibliometric analysis, as this research area transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries and reflects discussions from feminist and LGBTQIA+ social movements. This paper proposes a novel approach for identifying gender/sex related publications scattered across diverse scientific disciplines. Using the Dimensions database, we employ bibliometric techniques, natural language processing (NLP) and manual curation to compile a dataset of scientific publications that allows for the analysis of Gender Studies and its influence across different disciplines.
  This is achieved through a methodology that combines a core of specialized journals with a comprehensive keyword search over titles. These keywords are obtained by applying Topic Modeling (BERTopic) to the corpus of titles and abstracts from the core. This methodological strategy, divided into two stages, reflects the dynamic interaction between Gender Studies and its dialogue with different disciplines. This hybrid system surpasses basic keyword search by mitigating potential biases introduced through manual keyword enumeration.
  The resulting dataset comprises over 1.9 million scientific documents published between 1668 and 2023, spanning four languages. This dataset enables a characterization of Gender Studies in terms of addressed topics, citation and collaboration dynamics, and institutional and regional participation. By addressing the methodological challenges of studying "more-than-disciplinary" research areas, this approach could also be adapted to delineate other conversations where disciplinary boundaries are difficult to disentangle.</description>

      <title>Biases in gendered citation practices: an exploratory study and some reflections on the Matthew and Matilda effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02801v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies conducted in different scientific disciplines have concluded that researchers belonging to some socio-cultural groups (e.g., women, racialized people) are usually less cited than other researchers belonging to dominating groups. This is usually due to the presence of citation biases in reference lists. These citation biases towards researchers from some socio-cultural groups may inevitably cause unfairness and inaccuracy in the assessment of articles impact. These citation biases may therefore translate to significant disparities in promotion, retention, grant funding, awards, collaborative opportunities, and publications. In this paper, we conduct the first study aiming at analyzing gendered citation practices in the software engineering (SE) literature. Our study allows reflecting on citations practices adopted in the SE field and serves as a starting point for more robust empirical studies on the analyzed topic. Our results show that some efforts still need to be done to achieve fairness in citation practices in the SE field. Such efforts may notably consist in the inclusion of citation diversity statements in manuscripts submitted for publication in SE journals and conferences.</description>
