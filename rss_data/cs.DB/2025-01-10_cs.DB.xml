      <title>ThriftLLM: On Cost-Effective Selection of Large Language Models for Classification Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and generating natural language content, attracting widespread popularity in both industry and academia in recent years. An increasing number of services have sprung up which offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs demonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text classification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexity, and performance are priced diversely. Driven by this observation, a growing number of researchers are investigating the LLM ensemble strategy with a focus on cost-effectiveness, aiming to decrease overall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, i.e., how to find an LLM ensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance.
  In this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of prediction accuracy which we formally define. We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the ensemble selection problem as that of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget such that the overall prediction accuracy is maximized. We theoretically establish the non-decreasing and non-submodular properties of the prediction accuracy function and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. Subsequently, we apply dynamic programming and propose an algorithm called ThriftLLM. We prove that ThriftLLM achieves a near-optimal approximation guarantee. In addition, it achieves state-of-the-art query performance on multiple real-world datasets against 3 competitors in our extensive experimental evaluation, strongly supporting the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>CHASE: A Native Relational Database for Hybrid Queries on Structured and Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Querying both structured and unstructured data has become a new paradigm in data analytics and recommendation. With unstructured data, such as text and videos, are converted to high-dimensional vectors and queried with approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS). State-of-the-art database systems implement vector search as a plugin in the relational query engine, which tries to utilize the ANN index to enhance performance. After investigating a broad range of hybrid queries, we find that such designs may miss potential optimization opportunities and achieve suboptimal performance for certain queries. In this paper, we propose CHASE, a query engine that is natively designed to support efficient hybrid queries on structured and unstructured data. CHASE performs specific designs and optimizations on multiple stages in query processing. First, semantic analysis is performed to categorize queries and optimize query plans dynamically. Second, new physical operators are implemented to avoid redundant computations, which is the case with existing operators. Third, compilation-based techniques are adopted for efficient machine code generation. Extensive evaluations using real-world datasets demonstrate that CHASE achieves substantial performance improvements, with speedups ranging from 13% to an extraordinary 7500 times compared to existing systems. These results highlight CHASE's potential as a robust solution for executing hybrid queries.</description>

      <title>Preference Queries over Taxonomic Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When composing multiple preferences characterizing the most suitable results for a user, several issues may arise. Indeed, preferences can be partially contradictory, suffer from a mismatch with the level of detail of the actual data, and even lack natural properties such as transitivity. In this paper we formally investigate the problem of retrieving the best results complying with multiple preferences expressed in a logic-based language. Data are stored in relational tables with taxonomic domains, which allow the specification of preferences also over values that are more generic than those in the database. In this framework, we introduce two operators that rewrite preferences for enforcing the important properties of transitivity, which guarantees soundness of the result, and specificity, which solves all conflicts among preferences. Although, as we show, these two properties cannot be fully achieved together, we use our operators to identify the only two alternatives that ensure transitivity and minimize the residual conflicts. Building on this finding, we devise a technique, based on an original heuristics, for selecting the best results according to the two possible alternatives. We finally show, with a number of experiments over both synthetic and real-world datasets, the effectiveness and practical feasibility of the overall approach.</description>

      <title>GaussDB-Global: A Geographically Distributed Database System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geographically distributed database systems use remote replication to protect against regional failures. These systems are sensitive to severe latency penalties caused by centralized transaction management, remote access to sharded data, and log shipping over long distances. To tackle these issues, we present GaussDB-Global, a sharded geographically distributed database system with asynchronous replication, for OLTP applications. To tackle the transaction management bottleneck, we take a decentralized approach using synchronized clocks. Our system can seamlessly transition between centralized and decentralized transaction management, providing efficient fault tolerance and streamlining deployment. To alleviate the remote read and log shipping issues, we support reads on asynchronous replicas with strong consistency, tunable freshness guarantees, and dynamic load balancing. Our experimental results on a geographically distributed cluster show that our approach provides up to 14x higher read throughput, and 50% more TPC-C throughput compared to our baseline.</description>

      <title>QMDB: Quick Merkle Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Updating, managing, and proving world state are key bottlenecks facing the execution layer of blockchains today. Existing storage solutions are not flash-optimized and suffer from high flash write amplification and excessive DRAM requirements, forcing a trade-off between throughput and decentralization. We present the Quick Merkle Database (QMDB), an SSD-optimized authenticated data structure that delivers a superset of the features of existing databases. QMDB's append-only design enables 1 SSD read per state access, $O(1)$ I/Os for updates, and in-memory Merkleization on a DRAM footprint small enough to fit on consumer-grade PCs. We demonstrate that QMDB offers a significant leap in throughput ($6 \times$ over RocksDB and $8 \times$ over a state-of-the-art verifiable database) and validate its scalability on datasets up to 15 billion entries ($10 \times$ Ethereum's state size in 2024). Our projections indicate QMDB could store a theoretical maximum of 280 billion entries on a single machine, far exceeding current blockchain requirements. QMDB scales across both commodity and enterprise hardware, achieving up to 2 million state updates per second. QMDB sets a new benchmark for verifiable databases, alleviating today's storage bottlenecks, lowering barriers to blockchain participation, and unlocking new blockchain applications.</description>

      <title>SEA-SQL: Semantic-Enhanced Text-to-SQL with Adaptive Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly contributed to the progress of the Text-to-SQL task. A common requirement in many of these works is the post-correction of SQL queries. However, the majority of this process entails analyzing error cases to develop prompts with rules that eliminate model bias. And there is an absence of execution verification for SQL queries. In addition, the prevalent techniques primarily depend on GPT-4 and few-shot prompts, resulting in expensive costs. To investigate the effective methods for SQL refinement in a cost-efficient manner, we introduce Semantic-Enhanced Text-to-SQL with Adaptive Refinement (SEA-SQL), which includes Adaptive Bias Elimination and Dynamic Execution Adjustment, aims to improve performance while minimizing resource expenditure with zero-shot prompts. Specifically, SEA-SQL employs a semantic-enhanced schema to augment database information and optimize SQL queries. During the SQL query generation, a fine-tuned adaptive bias eliminator is applied to mitigate inherent biases caused by the LLM. The dynamic execution adjustment is utilized to guarantee the executability of the bias eliminated SQL query. We conduct experiments on the Spider and BIRD datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework. The results demonstrate that SEA-SQL achieves state-of-the-art performance in the GPT3.5 scenario with 9%-58% of the generation cost. Furthermore, SEA-SQL is comparable to GPT-4 with only 0.9%-5.3% of the generation cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal Oblivious Algorithms for Multi-way Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cloud databases, cloud computation over sensitive data uploaded by clients inevitably causes concern about data security and privacy. Even when encryption primitives and trusted computing environments are integrated into query processing to safeguard the actual contents of the data, access patterns of algorithms can still leak private information about the data. Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) and circuits are two generic approaches to address this issue, ensuring that access patterns of algorithms remain oblivious to the data. However, deploying these methods on insecure algorithms, particularly for multi-way join processing, is computationally expensive and inherently challenging.
  In this paper, we propose a novel sorting-based algorithm for multi-way join processing that operates without relying on ORAM simulations or other security assumptions. Our algorithm is a non-trivial, provably oblivious composition of basic primitives, with time complexity matching the insecure worst-case optimal join algorithm, up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, it is cache-agnostic, with cache complexity matching the insecure lower bound, also up to a logarithmic factor. This clean and straightforward approach has the potential to be extended to other security settings and implemented in practical database systems.</description>

      <title>Deep Overlapping Community Search via Subspace Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Overlapping Community Search (OCS) identifies nodes that interact with multiple communities based on a specified query. Existing community search approaches fall into two categories: algorithm-based models and Machine Learning-based (ML) models. Despite the long-standing focus on this topic within the database domain, current solutions face two major limitations: 1) Both approaches fail to address personalized user requirements in OCS, consistently returning the same set of nodes for a given query regardless of user differences. 2) Existing ML-based CS models suffer from severe training efficiency issues. In this paper, we formally redefine the problem of OCS. By analyzing the gaps in both types of approaches, we then propose a general solution for OCS named Sparse Subspace Filter (SSF), which can extend any ML-based CS model to enable personalized search in overlapping structures. To overcome the efficiency issue in the current models, we introduce Simplified Multi-hop Attention Networks (SMN), a lightweight yet effective community search model with larger receptive fields. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ML-based study of overlapping community search. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of SMN within the SSF pipeline, achieving a 13.73% improvement in F1-Score and up to 3 orders of magnitude acceleration in model efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>
