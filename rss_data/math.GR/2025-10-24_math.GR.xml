      <title>Rings of invariants of three-dimensional upper-triangular representations of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work proves that, for three-dimensional upper triangular groups over a field of odd characteristic with an abelian unipotent subgroup, the ring of invariants is polynomial if and only if the unipotent subgroup is generated by pseudoreflections or does not contain transvections.</description>

      <title>Loops with squares in two nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although little can be gleaned about a loop with the property that its squares are, say, left nuclear ($xx\cdot yz = (xx\cdot y)z$), if its squares are also, say, middle nuclear ($(x\cdot yy)z = x(yy\cdot z)$), then the loop exhibits more structure than one might initially guess. Loops with squares in (at least) two nuclei include many well known classes of loops, such as C loops and extra loops, and not so well known classes such left C loops. In any loop with, say, left and middle nuclear squares, the intersection of the left and middle nuclei is a normal subloop; hence such a loop is simple if and only if it is a group or a simple unipotent loop. Loops in which squaring is a centralizing endomorphism have even more structure; they are power-associative, and a torsion loop in that class is a direct product of a loop of $2$-elements and a loop of elements of odd order.</description>

      <title>Zassenhaus filtrations as intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zassenhaus filtrations of profinite groups are an important tool to study profinite groups.In this paper, we describe Zassenhaus filtrations of profinite groups as intersections of kernels of certain representations. In this way we introduce a link between studying profinite groups with methods of Zassenhaus filtrations and representation theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every finitely generated cohomologically trivial module over $RG$, where $G$ is a finite $p$-group and $R$ is a $p$-adic ring, splits as the direct sum of a finite cohomologically trivial $RG$-module and a free $RG$-module. Along the way, we also establish other results concerning generators and relators of such modules.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomological induction for transverse measured groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an induction isomorphism in the context of measurable bounded cohomology of discrete measured groupoid, which generalizes the Eckmann-Shapiro isomorphism in bounded cohomology of lattices due to Burger and Monod. In our wider setting, the role of lattices is taken by the class of transverse measured groupoids $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ associated with a cross-section $Y$ in a pmp dynamical system $(X, \mu)$ of a lcsc group $G$ such that the associated hitting time process of $Y$ is locally integrable. Typical examples are given by pattern groupoids of strong approximate lattices.
  Under the assumptions that $G$ is unimodular we show that the measurable bounded cohomology of $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ is isomorphic to the continuous bounded cohomology of $G$ with coefficients in $\text{L}^{\infty}(X, \mu)$. As a consequence, if $G$ is amenable, then $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ is boundedly acyclic, and in general the restriction map $\text{H}_{\text{cb}}^\bullet (G; \mathbb{R}) \to \text{H}_{\text{mb}}^\bullet ((\mathcal{G}, \nu);\underline{\mathbb{R}})$ is injective. Moreover, it follows from known results in continuous bounded cohomology that if $G$ is a semisimple higher rank Lie group of Hermitian (respectively complex classical) type, then the second (respectively third) measurable bounded cohomology of $(\mathcal{G}, \nu)$ is generated by the restriction of the bounded K\"ahler class (respectively bounded Borel class). These are the first explicit computations of non-trivial bounded cohomology groups of measured groupoids which are not isomorphic to an action groupoid.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Cohen--Lyndon property holds for all non-metric small-cancellation quotients. This generalises the analogous result from the metric small-cancellation setting, and answers a question asked by Lyndon in 1966 and by Wall in his 1979 problem list.</description>

      <title>Word Measures on Wreath Products II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every word $w$ in $F_r$, the free group of rank $r$, induces a probability measure (the $w$-measure) on every finite group $G$, by substitution of random $G$-elements in the letters. This measure is determined by its Fourier coefficients: the $w$-expectations $E_w[\chi]$ of the irreducible characters of $G$. For every finite group $G$, every stable character $\chi$ of $G\wr S_n$ (trace of a finitely generated $FI_G$-module), and every word $w\in F_r$, we approximate $E_w[\chi]$ up to an error term of $O(n^{-\pi(w)})$, where $\pi(w)$ is the primitivity rank of $w$. This generalizes previous works by Puder, Hanany, Magee and the author. As an application we show that random Schreier graphs of representation-stable actions of $G\wr S_n$ are close-to-optimal expanders. The paper reveals a surprising relation between stable representation theory of wreath products and not-necessarily connected Stallings core graphs.</description>

      <title>Twisted products of monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A twisting of a monoid $S$ is a map $\Phi:S\times S\to\mathbb{N}$ satisfying the identity $\Phi(a,b) + \Phi(ab,c) = \Phi(a,bc) + \Phi(b,c)$. Together with an additive commutative monoid $M$, and a fixed $q\in M$, this gives rise a so-called twisted product $M\times_\Phi^qS$, which has underlying set $M\times S$ and multiplication $(i,a)(j,b) = (i+j+\Phi(a,b)q,ab)$. This construction has appeared in the special cases where $M$ is $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition, $S$ is a diagram monoid (e.g.~partition, Brauer or Temperley-Lieb), and $\Phi$ counts floating components in concatenated diagrams.
  In this paper we identify a special kind of `tight' twisting, and give a thorough structural description of the resulting twisted products. This involves characterising Green's relations, (von Neumann) regular elements, idempotents, biordered sets, maximal subgroups, Sch\"{u}tzenberger groups, and more. We also consider a number of examples, including several apparently new ones, which take as their starting point certain generalisations of Sylvester's rank inequality from linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Normalisers of parabolic subgroups of Artin--Tits groups and Tits cone intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a Coxeter diagram and let $J \subseteq \Gamma$. Motivated by 3-fold flops, Iyama and Wemyss study the hyperplane arrangement in the Tits cone intersection of $J$, which is a $J$-relative generalisation of the classical Coxeter arrangement. For $\Gamma$ of finite-type, we show that its complexified hyperplane complement is a $K(\pi,1)$ space for the normaliser (quotient) of the standard parabolic subgroup of the Artin--Tits group attached to $J$. For general $\Gamma$ we show that Brink--Howlett's groupoid, which describes normalisers of parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups, has its universal cover described by the wall-and-chamber structure of the Tits cone intersection. We use this to show that wall crossing sequences satisfy an "atomic Matsumoto relation", generalising a theorem of Ko and answering questions raised by Iyama and Wemyss.</description>

      <title>Stable finiteness of ample groupoid algebras, traces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study stable finiteness of ample groupoid algebras with applications to inverse semigroup algebras and Leavitt path algebras, recovering old results and proving some new ones. In addition, we develop a theory of (faithful) traces on ample groupoid algebras, mimicking the $C^*$-algebra theory but taking advantage of the fact that our functions are simple and so do not have integrability issues, even in the non-Hausdorff setting. The theory of traces is closely connected with the theory of invariant means on Boolean inverse semigroups. It turns out that for Hausdorff ample groupoids with compact unit space, having a stably finite algebra over some commutative ring implies the existence of a tracial state on its reduced $C^*$-algebra. We include an appendix on stable finiteness of more general semigroup algebras, improving on an earlier result of Munn, which is independent of the rest of the paper.</description>

      <title>On RoCK blocks of double covers of symmetric and alternating groups and the refined Brou\'e conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02147v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kleshchev and Livesey proved the existence of RoCK $p$-blocks for double covers of symmetric and alternating groups over large enough coefficient rings. They proved that these RoCK blocks of double covers are Morita equivalent to standard ``local" blocks via bimodules with endopermutation source. Based on this, Kleshchev and Livesey proved that RoCK blocks are splendidly Rickard equivalent to their Brauer correspondents. The analogous result for blocks of symmetric groups, a theorem of Chuang and Kessar, was an important step in Chuang and Rouquier ultimately proving Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for symmetric groups. In this paper we show that the Morita and splendid Rickard equivalences constructed by Kleshchev and Livesey descend to the ring $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p$-adic integers, hence prove Kessar and Linckelmann's refinement of Brou\'e's abelian defect group conjecture for these RoCK blocks.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Cannon-Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a closed fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold M, the inclusion of a fiber S, with S and M lifted to the universal covers gives an exponentially distorted embedding of the hyperbolic plane into hyperbolic 3-space. Nevertheless, Cannon and Thurston showed that there is a map from the circle at infinity of the hyperbolic plane to the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space. The Cannon-Thurston map is surjective, finite-to-one, and gives a space-filling curve. Here we prove that many natural measures on the circle when pushed forward by the Cannon-Thurston map become singular with respect to many natural measures on the 2-sphere. The circle measures we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from fully supported random walks on the surface group. Whereas the measures on the sphere we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from geometric random walks on the 3-manifold group. The singularity of measures is ultimately derived from the following geometric result. We prove that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a pushforward measure asymptotically spends a definite proportion of its time close to a fiber. On the other hand, we show that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a natural measure on the sphere spends an asymptotically negligible proportion of its time close to a fiber. For a more restricted class of measures, namely the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures from geometric random walks on the surface group, we also prove an effective result for the proportion of time spent close to a fiber. To this end, we give precise descriptions of quasi-geodesics in the Cannon-Thurston metric, which may be of independent interest.</description>
