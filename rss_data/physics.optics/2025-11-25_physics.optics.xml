      <title>Graphene and thin graphite films for ultrafast optical Kerr gating at 1 GHz repetition rate under focused illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to address sub-picosecond events of weak optical signals is essential for progress in quantum science, nonlinear optics, and ultrafast spectroscopy. While up-conversion and optical Kerr gating (OKG) offer femtosecond resolution, they are generally limited to ensemble measurements, making ultrafast detection in nano-optics challenging. OKG, with its broadband response and high throughput without phase-matching, is especially promising when used at high repetition rates under focused illumination.
  Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast detection scheme using the third-order nonlinearity of graphene and thin graphite films, operating at 1 GHz with sub-nanojoule pulses and achieving 141 fs temporal resolution. Their exceptionally large nonlinear refractive index, orders of magnitude higher than conventional Kerr media, enhances detection efficiency at smaller thicknesses, enables sub-picosecond response, and supports broadband operation. Their atomic-scale thickness minimizes dispersion and simplifies integration with microscopy platforms, optical fibers, and nanophotonic circuits, making them a compact, practical material platform for nano-optical and on-chip ultrafast Kerr gating.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of the orbital angular momentum of soft x-ray beams by consecutive diffractive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Production and manipulation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of coherent soft x-ray beams is demonstrated utilizing consecutive diffractive optics. OAM addition is observed upon passing the beam through consecutive fork gratings. The OAM of the beam was found to be decoupled from its spin angular momentum (SAM). Practical implementation of angular momentum control by consecutive devices in the x-ray regime opens new experimental opportunities, such as direct measurement of OAM beams without resorting to phase sensitive techniques, including holography. OAM analyzers utilizing fork gratings can be used to characterize the beams produced by synchrotron and free electron lasers sources; they can also be used in scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Dispersion and Low-Frequency Plasmons in Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural hyperbolic materials have attracted significant interest in the field of photonics due to their unique optical properties. Based on the initial successful explorations on layered crystalline materials, hyperbolic dispersion was associated with extreme structural anisotropy, despite the rarity of natural materials exhibiting this property. Here we show that non cubic electrides are generally promising natural hyperbolic materials owing to charge localization in interstitial sites. This includes elemental and binary electrides, as well as some two-dimensional materials that show prominent in-plane hyperbolic dispersion. They exhibit low plasma frequencies and a broad hyperbolic window spanning the infrared to the ultraviolet. In semiconductor electrides, anisotropic interband transitions provide an additional mechanism for hyperbolic behaviour. These findings remove the previously held prerequisite of structural anisotropy for natural hyperbolic materials, and open up new opportunities, which might change the current strategy for searching and design photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Optical kernel machine with programmable nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical kernel machines offer high throughput and low latency. A nonlinear optical kernel can handle complex nonlinear data, but power consumption is typically high with the conventional nonlinear optical approach. To overcome this issue, we present an optical kernel with structural nonlinearity that can be continuously tuned at low power. It is implemented in a linear optical scattering cavity with a reconfigurable micro-mirror array. By tuning the degree of nonlinearity with multiple scattering, we vary the kernel sensitivity and information capacity. We further optimize the kernel nonlinearity to best approximate the parity functions from first order to fifth order for binary inputs. Our scheme offers potential applicability across photonic platforms, providing programmable kernels with high performance and low power consumption.</description>

      <title>Mesh of Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices with Programmable Intensity Nulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light carrying transverse orbital angular momentum (T-OAM) in the form of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) is opening new degrees of freedom for structured light manipulation. Such spatiotemporal wavepackets hold significant potential for optical trapping, analog optical computing, studying photonic symmetry and topology, among others. Up to now, synthesizing of such vortices is limited in one dimension, either in temporal or spatial domain. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a two-dimensional flexible mesh of spatiotemporal optical vortices (M-STOV) with programmable intensity nulls, and analyze their diffraction patterns for detection. Furthermore, we extend the spectral range of M-STOV via second-harmonic generation while examining the transfer of OAM in this nonlinear process. This study establishes a foundational framework for designing higher dimensional spatiotemporal vortex fields and promises a high-capacity information carrier based on ST optical vortices.</description>

      <title>Multi-port programmable silicon photonics using low-loss phase change material Sb$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable photonic devices are rapidly emerging as a cornerstone of next generation optical technologies, with wide ranging applications in quantum simulation, neuromorphic computing, and large-scale photonic processors. A central challenge in this field is identifying an optimal platform to enable compact, efficient, and scalable reconfigurability. Optical phase-change materials (PCMs) offer a compelling solution by enabling non-volatile, reversible tuning of optical properties, compatible with a wide range of device platforms and current CMOS technologies. In particular, antimony tri-selenide ($\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$) stands out for its ultra low-loss characteristics at telecommunication wavelengths and its reversible switching. In this work, we present an experimental platform capable of encoding multi-port operations onto the transmission matrix of a compact multimode interferometer architecture on standard 220~nm silicon photonics using \textit{in-silico} designed digital patterns. The multi-port devices are clad with a thin film of $\text{Sb}_{2}\text{Se}_{3}$, which can be optically addressed using direct laser writing to provide local perturbations to the refractive index. A range of multi-port geometries from 2$\times$2 up to 5$\times$5 couplers are demonstrated, achieving simultaneous control of up to 25 matrix elements with programming accuracy of 90% relative to simulated patterns. Patterned devices remain stable with consistent optical performance across the C-band wavelengths. Our work establishes a pathway towards the development of large scale PCM-based reconfigurable multi-port devices which will allow implementing matrix operations on three orders of magnitude smaller areas than interferometer meshes.</description>

      <title>Roadmap: Emerging Platforms and Applications of Optical Frequency Combs and Dissipative Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of optical frequency combs (OFCs) has revolutionised science and technology by bridging electronics and photonics, driving major advances in precision measurements, atomic clocks, spectroscopy, telecommunications, and astronomy. However, current OFC systems still require further development to enable broader adoption in fields such as communication, aerospace, defence, and healthcare. There is a growing need for compact, portable OFCs that deliver high output power, robust self-referencing, and application-specific spectral coverage. On the conceptual side, progress toward such systems is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the fundamental principles governing OFC generation in emerging devices and materials, as well as evolving insights into the interplay between soliton and mode-locking effects. This roadmap presents the vision of a diverse group of academic and industry researchers and educators from Europe, along with their collaborators, on the current status and future directions of OFC science. It highlights a multidisciplinary approach that integrates novel physics, engineering innovation, and advanced researcher training. Topics include advances in soliton science as it relates to OFCs, the extension of OFC spectra into the visible and mid-infrared ranges, metrology applications and noise performance of integrated OFC sources, new fibre-based OFC modules, OFC lasers and OFC applications in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-resolved quantum fluctuations of light and matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until recently, attosecond optical spectroscopy and quantum optics evolved along non-overlapping directions. In attosecond science, attosecond pulses have been regarded as classical waves, applied to probe electron dynamics on their natural time scale. Here, we transfer fundamental concepts of quantum optics into attosecond physics, enabling control of both the properties of the XUV attosecond pulses and the quantum fluctuations of matter on attosecond time scales. By combining bright squeezed vacuum (BSV) with a strong laser field to drive high-harmonic generation, we transfer the quantum properties of the BSV onto the resulting XUV attosecond pulses. Applying advanced attosecond interferometry, we reconstruct the quantum state of the XUV high harmonics and their associated attosecond pulses with attosecond precision. Finally, we resolve the squeezing of the electron's wavepacket during one of the most fundamental strong-field phenomena - field induced tunneling. The ability to measure and control quantum correlations in both electrons and XUV attosecond pulses establishes a foundation for attosecond quantum electrodynamics, manipulating the quantum state of electrons and photons with sub-cycle precision.</description>

      <title>Topological interface modes in aperiodic subwavelength resonator chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interface modes in block disordered subwavelength resonator chains in one dimension. Based on the capacitance operator formulation, which provides a first-order approximation of the spectral properties of dimer-type block resonator systems in the subwavelength regime, we show that a two-fold topological characterization of a block disordered resonator chain is available if it is of dominated type. The topological index used for the characterization is a generalization of the Zak phase associated with one-dimensional chiral-symmetric Hamiltonians. As a manifestation of the bulk-edge correspondence principle, we prove that a localized interface mode occurs whenever the system consists of two semi-infinite chains with different topological characters. We also illustrate our results from a dynamic perspective, which provides an explicit geometric picture of the interface modes, and finally present a variety of numerical results to complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18400v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the maintenance of optical fiber networks, there is a growing demand for high-precision measurement of optical loss distribution and fault locations over long distances. In this study, we propose an OCDR method incorporating periodic pseudo-random modulation (PPRM), and demonstrate that it enables the acquisition of loss distribution based on Rayleigh scattering and the positions of reflection points in an approximately 100-km optical fiber, with a spatial resolution of about 19 cm and a measurement time of about 20 seconds.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of photonic topological edge and corner states via trivial claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline symmetry offers a powerful tool to realize photonic topological phases, in which additional trivial claddings are typically required to confine topological boundary states. However, the utility of the trivial cladding in manipulating topological waves is often overlooked. Here, we demonstrate two topologically distinct kagome photonic crystals (KPCs) based on different crystalline symmetries: \mathbit{C}_\mathbf{6}- symmetric KPCs exhibit a quantum spin Hall phase, while \mathbit{C}_\mathbf{3}-symmetric KPCs serve as trivial cladding. By tuning the geometric parameter of the trivial cladding, we observe that a pair of topological interface states featured with pseudospin-momentum locking undergoes a phase transition, accompanied by the appearance and disappearance of corner states in a finite hexagonal supercell. Such a geometry-induced band inversion is characterized by a sign change in the Dirac mass of the topological interface states and holds potential for applications such as rainbow trapping. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the corner states, which is a hallmark of higher-order topology, also depend critically on the trivial cladding. Our work highlights the crucial role of trivial claddings on the formation of topological boundary states, and offers a novel approach for their manipulation.</description>

      <title>Dispersion-Aware Modeling Framework for Parallel Optical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing represents a groundbreaking technology that leverages the unique properties of photons, with innate parallelism standing as its most compelling advantage. Parallel optical computing like cascaded Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) based offers powerful computational capabilities but also introduces new challenges, particularly concerning dispersion due to the introduction of new frequencies. In this work, we extend existing theories of cascaded MZI systems to develop a generalized model tailored for wavelength-multiplexed parallel optical computing. Our comprehensive model incorporates component dispersion characteristics into a wavelength-dependent transfer matrix framework and is experimentally validated. We propose a computationally efficient compensation strategy that reduces global dispersion error within a 40 nm range from 0.22 to 0.039 using edge-spectrum calibration. This work establishes a fundamental framework for dispersion-aware model and error correction in MZI-based parallel optical computing chips, advancing the reliability of multi-wavelength photonic processors.</description>

      <title>MOCLIP: A Foundation Model for Large-Scale Nanophotonic Inverse Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models (FM) are transforming artificial intelligence by enabling generalizable, data-efficient solutions across different domains for a broad range of applications. However, the lack of large and diverse datasets limits the development of FM in nanophotonics. This work presents MOCLIP (Metasurface Optics Contrastive Learning Pretrained), a nanophotonic foundation model that integrates metasurface geometry and spectra within a shared latent space. MOCLIP employs contrastive learning to align geometry and spectral representations using an experimentally acquired dataset with a sample density comparable to ImageNet-1K. The study demonstrates MOCLIP inverse design capabilities for high-throughput zero-shot prediction at a rate of 0.2 million samples per second, enabling the design of a full 4-inch wafer populated with high-density metasurfaces in minutes. It also shows generative latent-space optimization reaching 97 percent accuracy. Finally, we introduce an optical information storage concept that uses MOCLIP to achieve a density of 0.1 Gbit per square millimeter at the resolution limit, exceeding commercial optical media by a factor of six. These results position MOCLIP as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation photonic design and data-driven applications.</description>

      <title>Experimental insights into data augmentation techniques for deep learning-based multimode fiber imaging: limitations and success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode fiber~(MMF) imaging using deep learning has high potential to produce compact, minimally invasive endoscopic systems. Nevertheless, it relies on large, diverse real-world medical data, whose availability is limited by privacy concerns and practical challenges. Although data augmentation has been extensively studied in various other deep learning tasks, it has not been systematically explored for MMF imaging. This work provides the first in-depth experimental and computational study on the efficacy and limitations of augmentation techniques in this field. We demonstrate that standard image transformations and conditional generative adversarial-based synthetic speckle generation fail to improve, or even deteriorate, reconstruction quality, as they neglect the complex modal interference and dispersion that results in speckle formation. To address this, we introduce a physical data augmentation method in which only organ images are digitally transformed, while their corresponding speckles are experimentally acquired via fiber. This approach preserves the physics of light-fiber interaction and enhances the reconstruction structural similarity index measure~(SSIM) by up to 17\%, forming a viable system for reliable MMF imaging under limited data conditions.</description>

      <title>High-precision luminescence cryothermometry strategy by using hyperfine structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19088</link>

Abstract: A novel, to the best of our knowledge, ultralow-temperature luminescence thermometry strategy is proposed, based on a measurement of relative intensities of hyperfine components in the spectra of Ho$^{3+}$ ions doped into a crystal. A $^{7}$LiYF$_4$:Ho$^{3+}$ crystal is chosen as an example. First, we show that temperatures in the range 10-35 K can be measured using the Boltzmann behavior of the populations of crystal-field levels separated by an energy interval of 23 cm$^{-1}$. Then we select the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ line of the holmium $^5I_5 \rightarrow ^5I_7$ transition, which has a well-resolved hyperfine structure and falls within the transparency window of optical fibers (telecommunication S band), to demonstrate the possibility of measuring temperatures below 3 K. The temperature $T$ is determined by a least-squares fit to the measured intensities of all eight hyperfine components using the dependence $I(\nu) = I_1 \exp(-b\nu)$, where $I_1$ and $b = a\nu + \frac{\nu}{kT}$ are fitting parameters and a accounts for intensity variations due to mixing of wave functions of different crystal-field levels by the hyperfine interaction. In this method, the absolute and relative thermal sensitivities grow at $T$ approaching zero as $\frac{1}{T^2}$.and $\frac{1}{T}$, respectively. We theoretically considered the intensity distributions within hyperfine manifolds and compared the results with experimental data. Application of the method to experimentally measured relative intensities of hyperfine components of the 6089 cm$^{-1}$ PL line yielded $T = 3.7 \pm 0.2$ K. For a temperature of 1 K, an order of magnitude better accuracy is expected.</description>

      <title>Fast and length-independent transport time supported by topological edge states in finite-size Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19237v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to transport information with topological protection, we explore experimentally the fast transport time using edge states in one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains. The transport time is investigated in both one- and two-dimensional models with topological non-trivial band structures. The fast transport is inherited with the wavefunction localization, giving a stronger effective coupling strength between the mode and the measurement leads. Also the transport time in one-dimension is independent of the system size. To verify the asertion, we implement a chain of split-ring resonators and their complementary ones with controllable hopping strengths. By performing the measurements on the group delay of non-trivially topological edge states with pulse excitations, the transport time between two edge states is directly observed with the chain length up to $20$. Along the route to harness topology to protect optical information, our experimental demonstrations provide a crucial guideline for utilizing photonic topological devices.</description>

      <title>Scattering in Time-Varying Drude-Lorentz Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, the theoretical study of wave propagation in time varying materials is of current interest. Although significant in nearly all such experiments, material dispersion is commonly neglected in theoretical studies. Yet, as we show here, understanding the precise microscopic model for the material dispersion is crucial for predicting experimental outcomes. Here we study the temporal scattering coefficients of four different time-varying Drude-Lorentz models, exploring how an incident continuous wave splits into forward and backward waves due to an abrupt change in plasma frequency. The differences in the predicted scattering are unique to time-varying media, and arise from the exact way in which the time variation appears in the various model parameters. We verify our results using a custom finite difference time domain algorithm, concluding with a discussion of the limitations that arise from using these models with an abrupt change in plasma frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A robust and compact magneto-optical rotary encoder for the characterisation of robotic rotary joints is demonstrated. The system employs magnetic field-induced optical attenuation in a double-pass configuration using rotating nonuniform magnets around an optical circulator operating in reflection. The encoder tracks continuous 360{\deg} rotation with rotation sweep rates from {\nu} = 135 {\deg}/s to {\nu} = 370 {\deg}/s, and an angular resolution of {\Delta}{\theta} = 0.3{\deg}. This offers a low-cost and reliable alternative to conventional robot rotation encoders while maintaining competitive performance.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Multimodal and Multiscale Analysis of Alzheimer Disease in 5xFAD Mice: Optical Spectroscopies, TEM, Neuropathological, and Behavioral Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer disease (AD) is considered one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and there is no effective cure for it. Understanding the neuropathological mechanisms underlying AD is essential for identifying early, reliable biomarkers and developing effective therapies. In this paper, we report on a comprehensive multimodal study of AD pathology using the 5xFAD mouse model. We employed light-scattering techniques, Partial Wave Spectroscopy (PWS) and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR), to detect nanoscale structural alterations in brain tissues, nuclear components, and mitochondria. To support the light-scattering experiments, behavior, and histopathological studies were conducted. These analyses revealed significant increases in structural heterogeneity and mass density fluctuations in the brains of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. Behavioral assessment demonstrated memory impairment in 5xFAD mice, reflected by a reduced recognition index. Histopathological analysis further revealed increased amyloid beta plaques and microglia activation in the hippocampus and cortex of 5xFAD mice compared with Non-transgenic controls. An increase in structural disorder within brain tissues can be attributed to higher mass density fluctuations, likely arising from macromolecular rearrangement driven by amyloid beta aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses as the disease progresses. Our findings suggest that PWS and IPR-derived metrics provide sensitive biophysical indicators of early cellular and subcellular disruption, offering potential as quantitative biomarkers for the detection and progression of AD.</description>

      <title>Stable multipole solitons in defocusing saturable media with an annular trapping potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the existence, stability, and propagation dynamics of multipole-mode (necklace-shaped) solitons in the two-dimensional model of an optical medium with the defocusing saturable nonlinearity and an annular potential trough. Various families of stable multipole solitons trapped in the trough, from dipole, quadrupole, and octupole ones to multi-lobe complexes, are found. The existence domain remains invariant with the increase of the potential's depth. Solitons with a large number N of lobes are stable in a wide parameter region, up to N=48 and even farther. Actually, stable multipole solitons of an arbitrarily high order N can be found, provided that the trough's radius is big enough. The power of stable multipoles is essentially larger in comparison to previously studied models. It is demonstrated analytically and numerically that the application of a phase torque initiates stable rotation of the multipole complexes. Thus, we put forward an effective scheme for the stabilization of multipole solitons with an arbitrary high number of lobes, including rotating ones, which offers new possibilities for manipulating complex light beams.</description>

      <title>High-Accuracy Material Classification via Reference-Free Terahertz Spectroscopy: Revisiting Spectral Referencing and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how feature selection algorithms can enable accurate, reference-free classification of materials using sparse-frequency terahertz (THz) reflection spectroscopy. Three classes of feature selection strategies are evaluated. Namely, the filter-based mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance), the embedded LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), and the wrapper-based SFS (Sequential Forward Selection) algorithms. Each strategy is assessed using the Linear Logistic Regression, Na\"ive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine classifiers. Our results show that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a small subset of frequencies. Particularly, when non-referenced spectra are applied. Furthermore, we show that the SFS-selected features align with the materials' absorption bands, confirming that the discriminative power arises from genuine spectroscopic contrasts. These findings highlights that reducing spectral dimensionality through data-driven selection eliminates the need for broadband sources and reference measurements, enabling compact, application-specific THz sensors. This approach offers robust material identification in real-world scenarios such as security screening, non-destructive testing, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Observation of Dicke cooperativity between strongly coupled phonons and crystal-field excitations in a rare-earth orthoferrite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective interactions between localized electronic excitations and the crystal lattice are central to many emergent phenomena in materials, including ferroelectricity and quantum magnetism. Despite its importance, the scaling behavior of such cooperativity remains largely unexplored. Here, we report the direct observation of Dicke-type cooperativity arising from the coupled phonons and non-degenerate crystal-field transitions (CFE), namely a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect1, in the rare-earth orthoferrite, ErFeO3. Using magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we uncover strongly coupled spin, lattice, and orbital excitations. By varying the temperature, we identify the phonon-CFE coupling strength scales as sqrt(N), where N represents the effective ground-state population, which is a hallmark of Dicke cooperativity. Our findings verified the cooperative nature of the interaction between local Jahn-Teller ions and long-range phonons, offering a pathway for tailoring electronic and vibrational properties of materials through population control.</description>

      <title>Strong Energy Dependent Transition Radiation in a Photonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation of a charged particle crossing an alternating stack of slabs in the optical region is considered. Both disordered and periodic stacks are investigated. It is shown that for special type of alternating disordered and periodic stacks the radiation problem can be solved exactly for backward and forward Brewster observation angles. Strong $N^2$ dependence of radiation intensity on slab number is re-established in special case of the disordered stack. This leads to strong directivity either on forward or on backward Brewster angles depending on the type of stack randomness. In certain type of periodic photonic crystal, a strong energy dependence $E^4$ for relativistic particles of the radiation intensity, observed at Brewster's angle is found. Further increment of particle energy leads to saturation. The band structure of the corresponding photonic crystal (PhC) has a behavior, analogous to the Dirac cones in graphene. We suggest this special type $1D$ photonic crystal for application as a detector of relativistic particles.</description>

      <title>3M-TI: High-Quality Mobile Thermal Imaging via Calibration-free Multi-Camera Cross-Modal Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of global autonomous driving technology, the demand for its core sensing hardware, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), is escalating. As the light source part of the LiDAR system, lasers, particularly the cutting-edge Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSEL), have correspondingly attracted extensive research attention. The conventional manual design and optimization of PCSEL typically require expertise in semiconductor physics and months of dedicated effort to achieve satisfactory results. While AI-driven approaches can expedite this process, laser designers still need to invest time in learning the AI algorithms involved. Meanwhile Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their powerful reasoning abilities, can effectively comprehend natural language and provide constructive feedback in multi-turn dialogues. They have already demonstrated potential to assist humans in scientific fields such as robotics design and chemical discovery. A question naturally arises is: Can LLMs transform the lasers design process? This paper proposes a novel human-AI co-design paradigm to show that LLMs can guide the laser design and optimization process both conceptually and technically. Specifically, by simply having conversations, GPT assisted us with writing both Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation code and deep reinforcement learning (RL) code to acquire the optimized PCSEL solution, spanning from the proposition of ideas to the realization of algorithms. Given that GPT will perform better when given detailed and specific prompts, we break down the PCSEL design problem into a series of sub-problems and converse with GPT by posing open-ended heuristic questions rather than definitive commands. We achieved a significant milestone towards self-driving laboratories, that is, a fully automated AI-driven pipeline, for laser design and production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides possess valley pseudospin, enabling coupling between photon spin and electron spin for classical and quantum information processing. However, rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission in MoSe2 monolayers independent of excitation polarization. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement. The fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiroptical resonances with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths. We reveal degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Our measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of ~13. Our work could facilitate the development of ultracompact chiral classical and quantum light sources.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the saturable absorption behavior of a 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer integrated with a silicon nitride waveguide for applications in photonic neural networks. Using experimental transmission measurements and theoretical modeling, we characterize the nonlinear response of the material. Our model, incorporating quasi-Fermi level separation and carrier dynamics, successfully explains these behaviors and predicts the material's absorption dependence on the carrier density. Furthermore, we demonstrate a coupling efficiency of up to 20% between the 1T'-MoTe$_2$ monolayer and the silicon nitride waveguide, with saturation achievable at input powers as low as a few uW. These results suggest that 1T'-MoTe$_2$ is a promising candidate for implementing nonlinear functions in integrated photonic neural networks.</description>

      <title>NeOTF: Guidestar-free neural representation for broadband dynamic imaging through scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic imaging through time-varying scattering media is ubiquitous in real-world settings, yet it remains a defining unsolved problem as rapid spatiotemporal fluctuations overwhelm standard reconstruction pipelines that often rely on speckles with high signal-to-noise ratio. Existing approaches fall into two categories. Guidestar-based methods employ a guidestar to recover the system transfer function; however, in dynamic media, the speckle decorrelates rapidly, making the calibration quickly invalid. Guidestar-free methods infer information from speckle statistics, but rapid changes and noise often break phase retrieval. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NeOTF, a guidestar-free and neural-representation-based OTF retrieval method that enables dynamic imaging through time-varying scattering media. By optimizing this neural representation with only a few speckle images from unknown objects, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF without a guidestar. We experimentally demonstrate robust dynamic imaging through scattering with NeOTF at extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and broadband incoherent illumination (up to 300 nm spectral bandwidth) scenarios, and we numerically validate its dynamic imaging performance in time-varying scattering media leveraging spatio-temporal memory effect. Finally, we discuss and analyze its computational efficiency and generalization capabilities across anisotropic scattering media. These results establish NeOTF's promise as a practical and robust solution for dynamic imaging through scattering media. Open-sourced code and models are available at https://github.com/Xia-Research-Lab/NeOTF.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Models for Phase Retrieval with Optical Diffusers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is a nonlinear inverse problem that arises in a wide range of imaging modalities, from electron microscopy to Fourier ptychography. In particular, the reconstruction is facilitated when the sensing matrix is i.i.d. random, enabling strong theoretical guarantees and efficient reconstruction algorithms. However, its applicability is restricted by excessive computational costs. In this paper, we propose structured random models for phase retrieval, where we emulate a dense random matrix by a cascade of structured transforms and random diagonal matrices. We reduce the complexity from quadratic to log-linear at no cost in reconstruction performance. Through a spectral method initialization followed by gradient descent, robust reconstruction is obtained at an oversampling ratio as low as 2.8. Moreover, we observe that the reconstruction performance is solely determined by the singular-value distribution of the forward matrix. This class of models can directly be implemented with basic optical elements such as lenses and diffusers, paving the way for large-scale phase imaging with robust reconstruction guarantees.</description>

      <title>Memory Effects in Time-Modulated Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19378v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of radiative heat exchange between dipoles with time-modulated optical properties. This framework extends fluctuational electrodynamics beyond equilibrium by incorporating nonstationary correlations and memory effects induced by temporal modulation. Closed-form expressions for the heat currents in modulated many-body systems are obtained, together with a generalized Landauer-like formulation of the pairwise exchanges, where the transmission coefficient accounts for all inelastic frequency-conversion channels. Near-resonant modulation redistributes and amplifies thermal fluctuations across Floquet sidebands, acting as a parametric amplifier of thermal radiation and enabling active, frequency-selective control of nanoscale heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Mie-tronics supermodes and symmetry breaking in nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is usually believed that symmetry breaking in photonic systems leads to weaker optical confinement, such as in the case of metasurfaces when bound states in the continuum are replaced by quasi-bound states with lower quality factors (Q factors). Here we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. We consider finite-size arrays of optical resonators supporting Mie resonances (a Mie-tronics platform) and employ diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses. We demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronics supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in their physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, and reversing the trends predicted by infinite-lattice theories. We reveal that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These novel findings establish a unified wave-physics platform linking both scattering and diffraction theories. Also, they outline the design principles for multi-functional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>

      <title>Integrated soliton microcombs beyond the turnkey limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soliton microcombs generated in optical microresonators are accelerating the transition of optical frequency combs from laboratory instruments to industrial platforms. Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Ising accelerator with a reconfigurable interferometric photonic processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general-purpose programmable photonic processors offer a scalable and reconfigurable solution for a wide range of RF and optical applications. Therefore, implementing photonic Ising machines using programmable processors leverages the advantages of high speed and parallelism, enabling efficient hardware acceleration for finding ground-state solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. In this work, we demonstrate a novel programmable photonic Ising solver based on a hexagonal mesh general-purpose programmable photonic platform. The integrated system allows reconfigurable matrix multiplication and computes the Hamiltonian iteratively using an annealing algorithm that facilitates spin updates and effectively searches for the ground state. As a proof of concept, we experimentally solve two benchmark optimization problems, a fundamental three-node ferromagnetic coupling problem with external bias that demonstrates nontrivial spin interactions, and a four-node Max-Cut problem with arbitrary coupling matrices. Furthermore, to establish a large-scale capability, we emulated Ising problems with sizes up to N = 50, achieving success probabilities exceeding 80\%. Additionally, we examined the impact of errors, such as phase and coupling, on the performance of the programmable photonic Ising machine. Our general-purpose photonic Ising machine paves the way for implementing large-scale, programmable architectures for solving optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Superradiance in dense atomic samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the problem of superradiance in dense atomic samples, when dipolar interactions arise between atoms. Our treatment consists of the sequential use of the Holstein-Primakoff and mean-field approximations, from which we derive master equations for the strong and weak couplings of the sample with the reservoir. We find, in both cases, that the radiation emission presents remarkable features, with characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance. In particular, for strong sample-reservoir coupling, a whole comb of superpulses occurs within an envelope with the above-mentioned characteristic emission times much shorter and intensities much higher than those of Dicke superradiance.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced Hall-like lateral forces in a chiral-gain environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14754v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we demonstrate that vacuum fluctuations can induce lateral forces on a small particle positioned near a translation-invariant uniform non-Hermitian substrate with chiral gain. This type of non-Hermitian response can be engineered by biasing a low-symmetry conductor with a static electric field and is rooted in the quantum geometry of the material through the Berry curvature dipole. The chiral-gain material acts as an active medium for a particular circular polarisation handedness, while serving as a passive, dissipative medium for the other polarisation handedness. Owing to the nonreciprocity and gain characteristics, momentum is continuously exchanged in a preferred direction parallel to the surface between the test particle and the surrounding electromagnetic field, giving rise to lateral forces. Interestingly, the force can be viewed as a fluctuation-induced drag analogous to a Hall force. Indeed, although the gain is driven by an electric current, the resulting force acts perpendicular to the bias -- unlike conventional current-drag effects. This effect stems from the skewed propagation characteristics of surface modes and gain-momentum locking. Our theory reveals a Hall-like asymmetry in the field correlations and establishes a novel link between quantum geometry and fluctuation-induced phenomena, offering new possibilities for nanoscale control via tailored electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Tensor-network approach to quantum optical state evolution beyond the Fock basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the quantum evolution of light in nonlinear media is central to the development of next-generation quantum technologies. Yet modeling these processes remains computationally demanding, as the required resources grow rapidly with photon number and phase-space resolution. Here we introduce a tensor-network approach that efficiently captures the dynamics of nonlinear optical systems in a continuous-variable representation. Using the matrix product state (MPS) formalism, both quantum states and operators are encoded in a highly compressed form, enabling direct numerical integration of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the method by simulating degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and show that it accurately reproduces established theoretical benchmarks - energy conservation, pump depletion, and quadrature squeezing - even in regimes where conventional Fock-basis simulations become infeasible. For high-intensity pump fields ($\alpha = 100$), the MPS representation achieves compression ratios above $3\cdot 10^3$ while preserving physical fidelity. This framework opens a scalable route to modeling multimode quantum light and nonlinear optical phenomena beyond the reach of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens2.</description>
