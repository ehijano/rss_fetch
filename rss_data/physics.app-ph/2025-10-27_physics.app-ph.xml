      <title>Intermediate Resistive State in Wafer-Scale MoS${_2}$ Memristors through Lateral Silver Filament Growth for Artificial Synapse Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors based on two-dimensional materials (2DMs) have garnered significant attention due to their fast resistive switching (RS) behavior and atomic-level thickness, which enables low power consumption, making them promising candidates for neuromorphic computing. Among these, memristors based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$) have been extensively studied. Their RS has been attributed to the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs). However, the underlying mechanism of filament formation remains underexplored, and the inherently stochastic nature of RS leads to high variability and limited reproducibility. Additionally, the lack of scalable fabrication techniques for 2DM-based memristors restricts their integration into standard semiconductor technology. Here, we demonstrate memristors based on metal-organic chemical vapor-deposited MoS${_2}$ on the wafer-scale. Our devices exhibit volatile and nonvolatile RS behavior, tunable by modulating the current compliance. Notably, we observe stable RS characteristics in an intermediate resistive state (IRS), featuring set and reset voltages within $\pm$1 V, an endurance exceeding 2500 cycles in direct current mode, and a state retention over 10${^6}$ s. The experimental data, complemented with simulations, suggest that the IRS originates from the lateral growth of the CF within the MoS${_2}$ layer. Furthermore, the devices successfully emulate synaptic plasticity with current responses on the microsecond timescale, highlighting their potential for large-scale integration in neuromorphic computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Phononic Combs in Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency combs consist of a spectrum of evenly spaced spectral lines. Optical frequency combs enable technologies ranging from timing, LiDAR, and ultra-stable signal sources. Microwave frequency combs are analogous to optical frequency combs, but often leverage electronic nonlinearity for comb generation. Generating microwave frequency combs using piezoelectric mechanical resonators would enable this behavior in a more compact form factor, thanks to the shorter acoustic wavelengths. In this work, we demonstrate a microwave frequency comb leveraging thermal nonlinearity in high quality factor ($Q$) overmoded acoustic resonators in thin film lithium niobate. By providing input power at 257 MHz, which is the sum frequency of two acoustic modes at 86 MHz and 171 MHz, we generate parametric down conversion and comb generation. We explore the nonlinear mixing regimes and the associated conditions for comb generation. Comb spacing is observed to vary significantly with drive frequency and power, and its general behavior is found to rely heavily on initial conditions. This demonstration showcases the potential for further improvement in compact and efficient microwave frequency combs, leveraging nonlinear acoustic resonators.</description>

      <title>Combining metal dewetting and lateral etching for the scalable top-down fabrication of GaN nanowire arrays with independently tunable diameter and spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The top-down fabrication of nanowires based on patterning via metal dewetting is a cost-effective and scalable approach that is particularly suited for applications requiring large arrays of nanowires. Advantageously, the nanowire diameter can be tailored by the initial metal film thickness. However, we show here that metal dewetting inherently leads to a coupling between the nanowire diameter and spacing. To overcome this limitation, we introduce two strategies that are exemplified for GaN nanowires: (i) modification of the surface and interface energies within the dewetting system, and (ii) thinning of the nanowires by lateral etching. In the first strategy, GaN(0001), SiOx, and SiNx substrate surfaces are combined with Au, Pt, and Pt-Au alloy dewetting metals to tune the dewetting behavior. The differences in interface energies affect the relation between nanowire diameter and spacing, albeit within a limited range. The second strategy adds a lateral etching step to the conventional top-down nanowire fabrication process. This step at the same time reduces the nanowire diameter and increases the spacing, thus enabling combinations beyond the constraints of metal dewetting alone. When in addition different initial nanowire diameters are employed, it is possible to independently control diameter and spacing over a substantially extended range. Therefore, the inherent limitation of conventional dewetting-based patterning approaches for the top-down fabrication of nanowires is overcome.</description>

      <title>Dose Constraints for High-Resolution Imaging of Biological Specimens with Extreme Ultraviolet and Soft X-ray radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical evaluation of radiation dose constraints for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray microscopy. Our work particularly addresses the long-standing concern regarding strong absorption of EUV radiation in biological specimens. Using an established dose-resolution model, we compare hydrated and dehydrated cellular states and quantify the fluence required for nanoscale imaging. Our analysis identifies a protein window spanning photon energies from 70 eV up to the carbon K-edge (284 eV), where EUV microscopy could in principle achieve sub-10 nm half-pitch resolution in dehydrated samples at doses well below the Henderson limit, thereby eliminating the need for cryogenic conditions. In this situation, the radiation dose required for EUV imaging is also substantially lower than what is required for comparable resolution in water window soft X-ray microscopy. Furthermore, EUV photons with sufficiently high energy exhibit penetration depths of um-level in dehydrated biomatter, enabling exceptional amplitude and phase contrast through thin cellular regions and small cells. These findings provide quantitative guidelines for photon energy selection and establish the EUV protein window as a dose-efficient and physically viable modality for high-resolution, label-free, material-specific imaging of dehydrated biological matter.</description>

      <title>Electrical-control of third-order nonlinearity via Fano interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable photonic computers necessitate the integration of electrically-tunable compact components into the photonic devices. In the state-of-the-art photonic quantum computers~(PQCs), phase-shift and displacement gates can be implemented in an electrically-programmable way. An efficient PQC, however, necessitates also the tuning of third or higher order nonlinearity for implementing continuous-variable~(CV) gates at a shorter sequence. Here, we demonstrate that such an optical component can be designed using Fano interference and Stark effect in a nonlinear nano-plasmonic system. We study the coupling of a broadband bright plasmon mode to a narrow linewidth quantum object(s), QO(s). We show that by shifting the level-spacing of the QO via Stark effect, one can continuously tune the third-order nonlinearity gate within a picosecond response time. We also present finite-difference time domain~(FDTD) simulations that take the retardation effects into account. In addition, we also show that enhancement due to Fano interference degrades if the QOs are positioned randomly as each QO introduces different phases. This reveals the importance of the spatial extent of the QO-ensemble to be employed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Centi-combs: Low-noise sub-GHz repetition-rate soliton frequency combs from crystalline resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate low-noise Kerr soliton frequency combs with repetition rates below 1~GHz in ultrahigh-Q crystalline magnesium fluoride resonators. Single soliton states with repetition rates of 0.90 GHz, 1.19 GHz, 1.59 GHz, 2.48 GHz, and 4.10 GHz are observed with continuous-wave laser excitation. The near-GHz soliton repetition frequency exhibits a single-sideband phase noise of -137 dBc/Hz at a 100 kHz offset, surpassing state-of-the-art microwave generators. These ``centi-combs'' bridge the gap between conventional mode-locked lasers and microresonator frequency combs, providing a new route towards real-time sampling, optical-to-microwave synchronization, and hybrid optical clock networks in a compact form. This work expands the operational range of Kerr soliton microcombs from the terahertz to the sub-gigahertz domain, opening new frontiers for frequency comb technologies.</description>

      <title>On the flow matching interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates, however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Induced Photon Statistics with Classical Beam propagation in Free Space Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of optical turbulence on field statistics using a nonlinear reconstruction and quantum phase-space formalism. Turbulence-distorted intensity sequences were processed through a nonlinear P3-type partial differential equation to retrieve the embedded phase, thereby reconstructing the complete complex optical field. The recovered fields were subsequently projected onto a Gaussian local oscillator to generate quadrature ensembles, enabling Wigner function tomography via Radon inversion. Photon-number distributions were obtained from the overlap of the reconstructed Wigner functions with Fock-state kernels, allowing direct evaluation of statistical moments and the Fano factor. Comparative analysis across four experimental configurations, Set 1: uncorrected turbulence, Set 2: turbulence with a single PMMA slab, Set 3: turbulence with dual PMMA slabs, and Set 4: free-space reference revealed the modification of phase noise and photon statistics due to partial compensation. Notably, the evolution of the Fano factor traced the transition among Poissonian, super-Poissonian, and near-sub-Poissonian regimes, quantitatively capturing the degree of turbulence mitigation achieved by the PMMA elements. This framework establishes a quantitative link between turbulence-induced phase distortions and quantum statistical behavior of reconstructed optical fields.</description>

      <title>Spin filtering on demand via localized states in an atomic-scale resonant tunneling magnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin filtering and its back-action spin transfer torque (STT) are key ingredients of latest spintronic devices based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). Resonant tunneling (RT), implemented by design or occurring as parasitic effects, is known to crucially affect macroscopic device performance, but direct experimental access to its individual microscopic processes has remained difficult. Here we apply the RT scheme from MTJs to spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM) for ultimate miniaturization obtained by addressing distinct sites on individual nanomagnets. Combined with energy selectivity, our experimental model set-up enables to study the spin filtering capabilities of RT through an individual spin-split vacuum resonance state and of the corresponding STT exerted on the nanomagnet. We find, that the sign and magnitude of the STT follow the effective spin-polarization of the resonance state, which, as we show, can by tailored on demand either by adjusting the applied bias or the current injection point on the nanostructure. We anticipate, that our atomic-scale RT-MTJ approach and the discovery of a versatile tunable spin-filter at smallest scale will prove invaluable for studying and designing next generation MTJs potentially based on recently discovered 2D van-der-Waals magnets or altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search for novel nanostructured materials for UV plasmonics a limited number of choices can be done. Materials such as aluminum, rhodium, gallium and few others can be used. One of the most interesting application for UV plasmonics is Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy. It can be extended to this spectral range to explore spectral properties of biomolecules that have only a small cross section in the visible spectral range. We have recently reported on a functional substrates based on nanoporous aluminum decorated with rhodium nanoparticles. This system showed an interesting behavior for UV excitation at 266 nm, with an unexpected decreasing Raman intensity for increasing rhodium nanoparticles concentrations. We proposed that this effect can be due to the difficult access to the hot spots for the molecules deposited via thermal evaporation. Here we extend this study exploring the performance of the system at another UV excitation wavelengths (325 nm) reporting on experimental results obtained using a deposition process that can bring the molecules at the hot-spots in a more efficient way. Extensive spectroscopic acquisitions, combined with 3D maps, allow to shade a more clear view on the performance of this plasmonic platform. In particular, the photodegration and the potential oxidation of biomolecules driven by the hot-electron/hot-holes produced by the rhodium nanoparticles will be reported.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the elastic scattering regime, probe position-averaged convergent beam electron diffraction (PACBED) patterns have proven robust for estimating specimen thickness and mistilt. Through simulation, we show that core-loss-filtered PACBED patterns can be used to measure the site occupancy of a small concentration of dopants in an otherwise known crystal structure. By leveraging the reciprocity between scanning and conventional transmission electron microscopy, we interpret core-loss PACBED patterns using a strategy traditionally used for determining dopant concentrations via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We show that differences in the interaction range of different elements hinder a purely measurement-based quantification strategy, but that this can be overcome through comparison with simulations that generalize the Cliff-Lorimer k-factors.</description>
