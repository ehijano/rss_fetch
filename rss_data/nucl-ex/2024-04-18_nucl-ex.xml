      <title>Polarization phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly interacting system created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions behaves almost as an ideal fluid with rich patterns of the velocity field exhibiting strong vortical structure. Vorticity of the fluid, via spin-orbit coupling, leads to particle spin polarization. Due to the finite orbital momentum of the system, the polarization on average is not zero; it depends on the particle momenta reflecting the spatial variation of the local vorticity. In the last few years, this field experienced a rapid growth due to experimental discoveries of the global and local polarizations. Recent measurements triggered further development of the theoretical description of the spin dynamics and suggestions of several new mechanisms for particle polarization.
  In this review, we focus mostly on the experimental results. We compare the measurements with the existing theoretical calculations but try to keep the discussion of possible underlying physics at the qualitative level. Future measurements and how they can help to answer open theoretical questions are also discussed. We pay a special attention to the employed experimental methods, as well as to the detector effects and associated corrections to the measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review model calculations of exclusive vector meson production in ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions. We highlight differences and similarities between different dipole models and leading twist shadowing calculations. Recent color glass condensate calculations are presented with focus on effects from nuclear structure and azimuthal anisotropies driven by interference effects.</description>

      <title>Discovering Nuclear Models from Symbolic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous phenomenological nuclear models have been proposed to describe specific observables within different regions of the nuclear chart. However, developing a unified model that describes the complex behavior of all nuclei remains an open challenge. Here, we explore whether novel symbolic Machine Learning (ML) can rediscover traditional nuclear physics models or identify alternatives with improved simplicity, fidelity, and predictive power. To address this challenge, we developed a Multi-objective Iterated Symbolic Regression approach that handles symbolic regressions over multiple target observables, accounts for experimental uncertainties and is robust against high-dimensional problems. As a proof of principle, we applied this method to describe the nuclear binding energies and charge radii of light and medium mass nuclei. Our approach identified simple analytical relationships based on the number of protons and neutrons, providing interpretable models with precision comparable to state-of-the-art nuclear models. Additionally, we integrated this ML-discovered model with an existing complementary model to estimate the limits of nuclear stability. These results highlight the potential of symbolic ML to develop accurate nuclear models and guide our description of complex many-body problems.</description>

      <title>Baryon density dependence of viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma at hadronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\phi$ meson and $\Omega$ baryon provide unique probes of the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) at hadronization in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using the quark recombination model with the quark phase-space information parameterized in a viscous blastwave, we perform Bayesian inference of the shear and bulk viscosities of the QGP at hadronization with a temperature of $T\sim 160$ MeV by analyzing the $\phi$ and $\Omega$ data in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 19.6-200 GeV and Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV, corresponding to a baryon chemical potential variation from $\mu_B\approx 0$ (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 2.76$ TeV) to $200$ MeV (at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 19.6$ GeV). We find that the shear viscosity to enthalpy ratio $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)$ of the QGP at hadronization decreases as $\mu_B$ increases, with $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.18$ at $\mu_B=0$ and $\eta T/(\epsilon +P)\approx 0.08$ at $\mu_B=200$ MeV, while the corresponding specific bulk viscosity is essentially constant with $\zeta T/(\epsilon + P)=0.02\sim 0.04$ for $\mu_B&lt;200$ MeV. Our results suggest that the QGP at hadronization ($T\sim 160$ MeV) with finite baryon density is more close to perfect fluid than that with zero baryon density.</description>

      <title>A direct probe of $\Lambda$ potential in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Li\`{e}ge intranuclear-cascade model together with the ablation model ABLA, an investigation is conducted into the effects of $\Lambda$ potential in $\Lambda$-nucleus and $\Lambda$-hypernucleus-nucleus collisions across various beam energies. The findings show that the angle and transverse-momentum distributions of scattered $\Lambda$ hyperon, the scattering cross section of the $\Lambda$ hyperon in $\Lambda$-nucleus collisions as well as the rapidity distribution of $\Lambda$ hyperon in $\Lambda$-hypernucleus-nucleus collisions are significantly influenced by the strength of the $\Lambda$ potential in these scattering reactions across various beam energies. These demonstrations, unhindered by the uncertainties of $\Lambda$ and hypernuclei productions in nuclear medium, allow for a direct investigation of the $\Lambda$ potential, especially its momentum dependence. The criticality of probing the $\Lambda$ potential is closely associated with the resolution of the "hyperon puzzle" in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and open questions in modern $\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For well over half a century, precision studies of neutron and nuclear $\beta$ decays have been at the forefront of searches for exotic electroweak physics. Recent advances in nuclear ab initio theory and the widespread use of effective field theories means that its modern understanding is going through a transitional phase. This has been propelled by current tensions in the global data set leading to renewed scrutiny of its theoretical ingredients. In parallel, a host of novel techniques and methods are being investigated that are able to sidestep many traditional systematic uncertainties and require a diverse palette of skills and collaboration with material science and condensed matter physics. We highlight the current opportunities and open questions with the aim of facilitating the transition to a more modern understanding of $\beta$ decay.</description>
