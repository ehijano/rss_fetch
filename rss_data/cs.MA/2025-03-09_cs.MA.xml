      <title>Multi Agent based Medical Assistant for Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) have revolutionized intelligent automation, but their application in healthcare faces challenges due to privacy concerns, latency, and dependency on internet access. This report introduces an ondevice, multi-agent healthcare assistant that overcomes these limitations. The system utilizes smaller, task-specific agents to optimize resources, ensure scalability and high performance. Our proposed system acts as a one-stop solution for health care needs with features like appointment booking, health monitoring, medication reminders, and daily health reporting. Powered by the Qwen Code Instruct 2.5 7B model, the Planner and Caller Agents achieve an average RougeL score of 85.5 for planning and 96.5 for calling for our tasks while being lightweight for on-device deployment. This innovative approach combines the benefits of ondevice systems with multi-agent architectures, paving the way for user-centric healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>Nature-Inspired Population-Based Evolution of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution, the engine behind the survival and growth of life on Earth, operates through the population-based process of reproduction. Inspired by this principle, this paper formally defines a newly emerging problem -- the population-based evolution of large language models (LLMs) -- and introduces a novel framework. Starting with a population of parent LLMs, our framework enables the population to evolve through four key operations: (i) crossover, merging the weights of different parents to create offspring LLMs, (ii) mutation, introducing small, random changes to model weights to foster diversity, (iii) selection, prioritizing high-performing models, and (iv) succession, transferring the learned experience from parent to offspring LLMs. With only 200 samples per new task, the LLM population evolves rapidly to adapt to the task at hand, without any gradients. Experiments on 12 datasets show that our framework consistently outperforms existing multi-LLM merging and adaptation methods, achieving accuracy gains of up to 54.8% over the best LLM in the initial population. Moreover, our framework allows for the evolution of LLMs across multiple new tasks simultaneously, scaling effectively with populations of up to 40 LLMs, and even zero-shot generalization to unseen held-out tasks. We have open-sourced the code on GitHub and released the weights of 10 parent LLMs, fine-tuned from gemma-2-2b-it, on HuggingFace$, enabling reproduction of our proposed framework using just a single 4090 GPU with 24GB memory, without any performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent System for AI-Assisted Extraction of Narrative Arcs in TV Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serialized TV shows are built on complex storylines that can be hard to track and evolve in ways that defy straightforward analysis. This paper introduces a multi-agent system designed to extract and analyze these narrative arcs. Tested on the first season of Grey's Anatomy (ABC 2005-), the system identifies three types of arcs: Anthology (self-contained), Soap (relationship-focused), and Genre-Specific (strictly related to the series' genre). Episodic progressions of these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases, enabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between automation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical interface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize the data. The system performed strongly in identifying Anthology Arcs and character entities, but its reliance on textual paratexts (such as episode summaries) revealed limitations in recognizing overlapping arcs and subtler dynamics. This approach highlights the potential of combining computational and human expertise in narrative analysis. Beyond television, it offers promise for serialized written formats, where the narrative resides entirely in the text. Future work will explore the integration of multimodal inputs, such as dialogue and visuals, and expand testing across a wider range of genres to refine the system further.</description>

      <title>Preserving Cultural Identity with Context-Aware Translation Through Multi-Agent AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language is a cornerstone of cultural identity, yet globalization and the dominance of major languages have placed nearly 3,000 languages at risk of extinction. Existing AI-driven translation models prioritize efficiency but often fail to capture cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and historical significance, leading to translations that marginalize linguistic diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-agent AI framework designed for culturally adaptive translation in underserved language communities. Our approach leverages specialized agents for translation, interpretation, content synthesis, and bias evaluation, ensuring that linguistic accuracy and cultural relevance are preserved. Using CrewAI and LangChain, our system enhances contextual fidelity while mitigating biases through external validation. Comparative analysis shows that our framework outperforms GPT-4o, producing contextually rich and culturally embedded translations, a critical advancement for Indigenous, regional, and low-resource languages. This research underscores the potential of multi-agent AI in fostering equitable, sustainable, and culturally sensitive NLP technologies, aligning with the AI Governance, Cultural NLP, and Sustainable NLP pillars of Language Models for Underserved Communities.

      <title>Enhancing Collective Intelligence in Large Language Models Through Emotional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the integration of emotional diversity into Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance collective intelligence. Inspired by the human wisdom of crowds phenomenon, where group decisions often outperform individual judgments, we fine-tuned the DarkIdol-Llama-3.1-8B model using Google's GoEmotions dataset and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to simulate emotionally diverse responses. Evaluating the model on a distance estimation task between Fargo, ND, and Seattle, WA, across 15,064 unique persona configurations, we analyzed how emotional states and social attributes influence decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that emotional integration shapes response patterns while maintaining acceptable prediction accuracy, revealing its potential to enhance artificial collective intelligence. This study provides valuable insights into the interplay of emotional diversity and decision-making in LLMs, suggesting pathways for creating emotionally aware AI systems that balance emotional depth with analytical precision.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Multi-Tenant Split Federated Learning for Foundation Models at the Network Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit exceptional generative capabilities across diverse downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets.</description>

      <title>GEMA-Score: Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score for Radiology Report Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic medical report generation supports clinical diagnosis, reduces the workload of radiologists, and holds the promise of improving diagnosis consistency. However, existing evaluation metrics primarily assess the accuracy of key medical information coverage in generated reports compared to human-written reports, while overlooking crucial details such as the location and certainty of reported abnormalities. These limitations hinder the comprehensive assessment of the reliability of generated reports and pose risks in their selection for clinical use. Therefore, we propose a Granular Explainable Multi-Agent Score (GEMA-Score) in this paper, which conducts both objective quantification and subjective evaluation through a large language model-based multi-agent workflow. Our GEMA-Score parses structured reports and employs NER-F1 calculations through interactive exchanges of information among agents to assess disease diagnosis, location, severity, and uncertainty. Additionally, an LLM-based scoring agent evaluates completeness, readability, and clinical terminology while providing explanatory feedback. Extensive experiments validate that GEMA-Score achieves the highest correlation with human expert evaluations on a public dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in clinical scoring (Kendall coefficient = 0.70 for Rexval dataset and Kendall coefficient = 0.54 for RadEvalX dataset).

      <title>VLMs Play StarCraft II: A Benchmark and Multimodal Decision Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce VLM-Attention, a multimodal StarCraft II environment that aligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience. Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing human-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of multimodal game AI. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2.</description>

      <title>Controllable Complementarity: Subjective Preferences in Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on human-AI collaboration often prioritizes objective performance. However, understanding human subjective preferences is essential to improving human-AI complementarity and human experiences. We investigate human preferences for controllability in a shared workspace task with AI partners using Behavior Shaping (BS), a reinforcement learning algorithm that allows humans explicit control over AI behavior.
  In one experiment, we validate the robustness of BS in producing effective AI policies relative to self-play policies, when controls are hidden. In another experiment, we enable human control, showing that participants perceive AI partners as more effective and enjoyable when they can directly dictate AI behavior. Our findings highlight the need to design AI that prioritizes both task performance and subjective human preferences. By aligning AI behavior with human preferences, we demonstrate how human-AI complementarity can extend beyond objective outcomes to include subjective preferences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a roadmap to address the current challenges in small-scale testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms. The roadmap is a joint effort of participants in the workshop "1st Workshop on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms," held on June 2 at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2024 in Jeju, South Korea. The roadmap contains three parts: 1) enhancing accessibility and diversity, especially for underrepresented communities, 2) sharing best practices for the development and maintenance of testbeds, and 3) connecting testbeds through an abstraction layer to support collaboration. The workshop features eight invited speakers, four contributed papers [1]-[4], and a presentation of a survey paper on testbeds [5]. The survey paper provides an online comparative table of more than 25 testbeds, available at https://bassamlab.github.io/testbeds-survey. The workshop's own website is available at https://cpm-remote.lrt.unibwmuenchen.de/iv24-workshop.</description>

Abstract: The field of emergent language represents a novel area of research within the domain of artificial intelligence, particularly within the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Although the concept of studying language emergence is not new, early approaches were primarily concerned with explaining human language formation, with little consideration given to its potential utility for artificial agents. In contrast, studies based on reinforcement learning aim to develop communicative capabilities in agents that are comparable to or even superior to human language. Thus, they extend beyond the learned statistical representations that are common in natural language processing research. This gives rise to a number of fundamental questions, from the prerequisites for language emergence to the criteria for measuring its success. This paper addresses these questions by providing a comprehensive review of 181 scientific publications on emergent language in artificial intelligence. Its objective is to serve as a reference for researchers interested in or proficient in the field. Consequently, the main contributions are the definition and overview of the prevailing terminology, the analysis of existing evaluation methods and metrics, and the description of the identified research gaps.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic Cooperation for Web Agents: Harnessing Complementary Strengths of Large and Small LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Web browsing agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown tremendous potential in automating complex web-based tasks. Existing approaches typically rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) to explore web environments and generate trajectory data, which is then used either for demonstration retrieval (for large LLMs) or to distill small LLMs (e.g., Llama3) in a process that remains decoupled from the exploration. In this paper, we propose AgentSymbiotic, an iterative framework that couples data synthesis with task-performance, yielding a "symbiotic improvement" for both large and small LLMs. Our study uncovers a complementary dynamic between LLM types: while large LLMs excel at generating high-quality trajectories for distillation, the distilled small LLMs-owing to their distinct reasoning capabilities-often choose actions that diverge from those of their larger counterparts. This divergence drives the exploration of novel trajectories, thereby enriching the synthesized data. However, we also observe that the performance of small LLMs becomes a bottleneck in this iterative enhancement process. To address this, we propose two innovations in LLM distillation: a speculative data synthesis strategy that mitigates off-policy bias, and a multi-task learning approach designed to boost the reasoning capabilities of the student LLM. Furthermore, we introduce a Hybrid Mode for Privacy Preservation to address user privacy concerns. Evaluated on the WEBARENA benchmark, AgentSymbiotic achieves SOTA performance with both LLM types. Our best Large LLM agent reaches 52%, surpassing the previous best of 45%, while our 8B distilled model demonstrates a competitive 49%, exceeding the prior best of 28%. Code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>M3HF: Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality (M3HF), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, M3HF leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weight by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that M3HF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.</description>

      <title>ReSo: A Reward-driven Self-organizing LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Reasoning Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models in complex problem-solving. However, current MAS frameworks are limited by poor flexibility and scalability, with underdeveloped optimization strategies. To address these challenges, we propose ReSo, which integrates task graph generation with a reward-driven two-stage agent selection process. The core of ReSo is the proposed Collaborative Reward Model, which can provide fine-grained reward signals for MAS cooperation for optimization. We also introduce an automated data synthesis framework for generating MAS benchmarks, without human annotations. Experimentally, ReSo matches or outperforms existing methods. ReSo achieves \textbf{33.7\%} and \textbf{32.3\%} accuracy on Math-MAS and SciBench-MAS SciBench, while other methods completely fail.

      <title>Human Implicit Preference-Based Policy Fine-tuning for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in USV Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems involving cooperation and competition among agents, such as an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) swarm used in search and rescue, surveillance, and vessel protection. However, aligning system behavior with user preferences is challenging due to the difficulty of encoding expert intuition into reward functions. To address the issue, we propose a Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) approach for MARL that resolves credit-assignment challenges through an Agent-Level Feedback system categorizing feedback into intra-agent, inter-agent, and intra-team types. To overcome the challenges of direct human feedback, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) evaluator to validate our approach using feedback scenarios such as region constraints, collision avoidance, and task allocation. Our method effectively refines USV swarm policies, addressing key challenges in multi-agent systems while maintaining fairness and performance consistency.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Nonlinear Guidance Strategies for Guaranteed Pursuit-Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the pursuit-evasion problem involving three agents -- a purser, an evader, and a defender. We develop cooperative guidance laws for the evader-defender team that guarantee that the defender intercepts the pursuer before it reaches the vicinity of the evader. Unlike heuristic methods, optimal control, differential game formulation, and recently proposed time-constrained guidance techniques, we propose a geometric solution to safeguard the evader from the pursuer's incoming threat. The proposed strategy is computationally efficient and expected to be scalable as the number of agents increases. Another alluring feature of the proposed strategy is that the evader-defender team does not require the knowledge of the pursuer's strategy and that the pursuer's interception is guaranteed from arbitrary initial engagement geometries. We further show that the necessary error variables for the evader-defender team vanish within a time that can be exactly prescribed prior to the three-body engagement. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cooperative defense strategy via simulation in diverse engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Agent Mapping for Planetary Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent robotic exploration stands to play an important role in space exploration as the next generation of robotic systems ventures to far-flung environments. A key challenge in this new paradigm will be to effectively share and utilize the vast amount of data generated onboard while operating in bandwidth-constrained regimes typical of space missions. Federated learning (FL) is a promising tool for bridging this gap. Drawing inspiration from the upcoming CADRE Lunar rover mission, we propose a federated multi-agent mapping approach that jointly trains a global map model across agents without transmitting raw data. Our method leverages implicit neural mapping to generate parsimonious, adaptable representations, reducing data transmission by up to 93.8% compared to raw maps. Furthermore, we enhance this approach with meta-initialization on Earth-based traversability datasets to significantly accelerate map convergence; reducing iterations required to reach target performance by 80% compared to random initialization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on Martian terrains and glacier datasets, achieving downstream path planning F1 scores as high as 0.95 while outperforming on map reconstruction losses.</description>

      <title>Safe Decentralized Multi-Agent Control using Black-Box Predictors, Conformal Decision Policies, and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>

      <title>Persuade Me if You Can: A Framework for Evaluating Persuasion Effectiveness and Susceptibility Among Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</description>
