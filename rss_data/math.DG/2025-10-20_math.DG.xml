      <title>Cohomogeneity One Expanding Ricci Solitons and the Expander Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the space of smooth gradient expanding Ricci soliton structures on $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ and $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ which are invariant under the action of $\text{SO}(3) \times \text{SO}(2)$. These solitons are cohomogeneity one and the soliton equation reduces to a system of $3$ ordinary differential equations. By analyzing the resultant ODEs, we prove that a $2$-parameter family of complete solitons exists in the case of each topology and that the solitons are asymptotic to cones over the link $S^2 \times S^1$. Analogous to work of Bamler and Chen, we define a notion of expander degree for these cohomogeneity one solitons. We proceed to calculate this cohomogeneity one expander degree in the cases of the specific topologies.</description>

      <title>Minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the two dimensional complex quadric via the loop group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a loop group (DPW-type) representation for minimal Lagrangian surfaces in the complex quadric $Q^{2}\cong \mathbb S^{2}\times \mathbb S^{2}$, formulated via a flat family of connections $\{\nabla^\lambda\}_{\lambda\in \mathbb S^{1}}$ on a trivial bundle. We prove that minimality is equivalent to the flatness of $\nabla^\lambda$ for all $\lambda$, describe the associated isometric $\mathbb S^{1}$-family, and establish a precise correspondence with minimal surfaces in $\mathbb S^{3}$ through their Gauss maps. Our framework unifies and streamlines earlier constructions (e.g., Castro--Urbano) and yields explicit families including $\mathbb R$-equivariant, radially symmetric, and trinoid-type examples.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Structure of Monopoles in R^3, Calorons, and ALF Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic structure of instantons on multi-centered Taub-NUT manifolds, calorons, and monopoles on R^3. We show that, without any assumptions on symmetry breaking, these instantons and monopoles asymptotically decompose as a sum of U(1) instantons and monopoles, respectively.</description>

      <title>Slope zero tensors, uniformizing variations of Hodge structure and quotients of tube domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an equivalence between two approaches to characterizing complex-projective varieties $X$ with klt singularities and ample canonical divisor that are uniformized by bounded symmetric domains. In order to do so, we show how to construct a uniformizing variation of Hodge structure from a slope zero tensor and vice versa. As a consequence, we generalize various uniformization results of Catanese and Di Scala to the singular setting. For example, we prove that $X$ is a quotient of a bounded symmetric domain of tube type by a group acting properly discontinuously and freely in codimension one if and only if $X$ admits a slope zero tensor. As a key step in the proof, we establish the compactness of the holonomy group of the singular K\"{a}hler--Einstein metric on $X_{\mathrm{reg}}$.</description>

      <title>A Structured Family of Grassmannian Constellations via Geodesic Mapping for MIMO Noncoherent Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel structured family of Grassmannian constellations for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) noncoherent communications over Rayleigh block-fading channels, where neither the transmitter nor the receiver has channel state information (CSI). The proposed constellation design is built upon the geodesic curves of the Grassmann manifold, thereby exploiting its underlying geometric structure. The resulting solution is limited in spectral efficiency (with a maximum constellation size of $4M^2$ points, where $M$ is the number of transmit antennas), targeting a rate in the range of $0.25$-$1$ bps/Hz. However, all space-time matrices resulting from this design exhibit the remarkable property of having a single nonzero entry per row, meaning that only one transmit antenna is active per time slot. This property significantly reduces hardware complexity and implementation cost, while also lowering power consumption, as only a single power amplifier is required for transmission. Furthermore, within the constellation size limits, the proposed design achieves error performance comparable to state-of-the-art optimization-based unstructured designs, as validated through symbol error rate (SER) numerical results. It also enables simple yet effective bit labeling, confirmed by comparisons of bit error rate (BER) and SER, and reduces the computational complexity of the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector for Grassmannian constellations by a factor of $M$.</description>

      <title>Exploring a New Design Paradigm for Omnidirectional MAVs for Minimal Actuation and Internal Force Elimination: Theoretical Framework and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept for achieving omnidirectionality in a multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses only 6 inputs and ensures no internal forces at the equilibria. The concept integrates a single actively-tilting propeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller, connected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this design ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and without resorting to overactuation (i.e., more than 6 inputs). A detailed dynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the analysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a forced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order to render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a geometric nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback linearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration error being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the closed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov arguments on the zero dynamics. We conclude by providing numerical simulations validating the proposed approach. They demonstrate the MAV capability to perform decoupled attitude and translational motions under non-zero initial conditions, parametric uncertainty, and actuators noise.</description>

      <title>Twisted Poincar\'e duality for orientable Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We geometrize the constructions of twisted Poisson modules introduced by Luo-Wang-Wu, and Poisson chain complexes with coefficients in Poisson modules defined in the algebraic setting to the geometric setting of Poisson manifolds. We then prove that for any orientable Poisson manifold $M$, there is an explicit chain isomorphism between the Poisson cochain complex with coefficients in any Poisson geometric module and the Poisson chain complex with coefficients in the corresponding twisted Poisson geometric module, induced by a modular vector field of $M$. These are the geometric analogues of results obtained by Luo-Wang-Wu for smooth Poisson algebras with trivial canonical bundle. In particular, a version of twisted Poincar\'e duality is established between the Poisson homologies and the Poisson cohomologies of an orientable Poisson manifold with coefficients in an arbitrary vector bundle with a flat contravariant connection. This generalizes the duality theorems for orientable Poisson manifolds established by Evens-Lu-Weinstein, and by Xu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This survey deals with two closely connected topics: first, the stability of Einstein metrics under the Einstein-Hilbert functional, and second, their deformation theory and the study of the moduli space of Einstein metrics on a compact manifold. To first order, both problems reduce to studying the spectrum and eigentensors of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian. We give an introduction to the classical theory and survey recent results and advances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the semilinear elliptic equation and inequality on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. In particular, we first obtain a Liouville theorem for the equation $\Delta_b u+F(u)=0$ based on a generalized Jerison-Lee's formula. Next, we prove the nonexistence of a positive solution to the inequality $\Delta_b u+F(u)\leq 0$ under the volume estimate.</description>

      <title>Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
  In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are \'Etale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
  The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
  There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.</description>

      <title>From amoebas to pluripotential theory on hybrid analytic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes are an introduction to the use of non-Archimedean geometry in the study of meromorphic degenerations of complex algebraic varieties. They provide a self-contained discussion of hybrid spaces, which fill in one-parameter degenerations with the associated non-Archimedean Berkovich space as a central fiber. The main focus is on the interplay between complex and non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, and on the relation between convergence of psh metrics and the associated Monge-Ampere measures in the hybrid space, following work of the author with M.Jonsson, and recent breakthrough work by Y.Li.</description>
