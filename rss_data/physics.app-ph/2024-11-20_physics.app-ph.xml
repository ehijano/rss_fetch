      <title>Reexamination of evaporation from horizontal surfaces with implications for solar interfacial evaporation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain reported solar interfacial-evaporation rates from porous materials beyond an apparent 100% efficiency using the thermal evaporation mechanism, many publications hypothesize that intermediate water inside porous materials have a reduced latent heat. Key supporting evidence is that water-only surfaces have lower dark evaporation rates than porous evaporators, with the ratio of the two rates taken as the latent heat reduction. Through simulations and experiments, we present benchmark evaporation rates of water and show that reported differences in natural evaporation are likely due to experimental error from recessed evaporating surfaces rather than from reduced latent heat. A few millimeters recession of the evaporating surface can drop evaporation rates over 50% due to a stagnant air layer, suggesting that the comparative experiments are prone to error and the latent heat reduction hypothesis cannot be substantiated. Our results indicate that new mechanistic directions need to be pursued to understand superthermal evaporation.</description>

      <title>Isospectrial reduction of the SSH3 lattice and its bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we propose an isospectral reduction (IR) approach for the mapping of a trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH3) lattice into a simplified two-site model, whose coupling dynamics ingeniously results in a precise bulk-edge correspondence of the original lattice. The isospectrally-reduced model has inter-cell couplings with dynamic response to the eigenstate energy, allowing for the control of topological phase transition by energy. We relate the bulk property of the reduced model to the band topology of the SSH3 lattice, allowing for there distinct topological phases with different number of topological edge state pair. An acoustic SSH3 chain is fabricated for experimental demonstration. The said topological edge state pairs are measured. Our study takes a pivotal step toward the exploration of topology in multiple wave systems, opening up possibilities for advanced control of topological waves.</description>

      <title>Variability in Resistive Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive memories are outstanding electron devices that have displayed a large potential in a plethora of applications such as nonvolatile data storage, neuromorphic computing, hardware cryptography, etc. Their fabrication control and performance have been notably improved in the last few years to cope with the requirements of massive industrial production. However, the most important hurdle to progress in their development is the so-called cycle-to-cycle variability, which is inherently rooted in the resistive switching mechanism behind the operational principle of these devices. In order to achieve the whole picture, variability must be assessed from different viewpoints going from the experimental characterization to the adequation of modeling and simulation techniques. Herein, special emphasis is put on the modeling part because the accurate representation of the phenomenon is critical for circuit designers. In this respect, a number of approaches are used to the date: stochastic, behavioral, mesoscopic..., each of them covering particular aspects of the electron and ion transport mechanisms occurring within the switching material. These subjects are dealt with in this review, with the aim of presenting the most recent advancements in the treatment of variability in resistive memories.</description>

      <title>Rapid Differentiation between Microplastic Particles Using Integrated Microwave Cytometry with 3D Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid identification of microparticles in liquid is an important problem in environmental and biomedical applications such as for microplastic detection in water sources and physiological fluids. Existing spectro-scopic techniques are usually slow and not compatible with flow-through systems. Here we analyze single microparticles in the 14 - 20 micrometer range using a combination of two electronic sensors in the same microfluidic system: a microwave capacitive sensor and a resistive pulse sensor. Together, this integrated sen-sor system yields the effective electrical permittivity of the analyte particles. To simplify data analysis, 3D electrode arrangements were used instead of planar electrodes, so that the generated signal is unaffected by the height of the particle in the microfluidic channel. With this platform, we were able to distinguish between polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) microparticles. We showcase the sensitivity and speed of this tech-nique and discuss the implications for the future application of microwave cytometry technology in the en-vironmental and biomedical fields.</description>

      <title>Columnar grain boundaries are the weakest link in hard coatings: Insights from micro-cantilever testing with bridge notches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of columnar grain boundaries on the fracture toughness was investigated using micro-cantilever fracture testing with a bridge notch, and a unique hard coating consisting of two distinct microstructures: one with columnar grains and another with an epitaxial layer. The bridge-failure sequence qualitatively demonstrated the lower fracture toughness at the columnar-grained structure. Quantitatively, the load drops measured at bridge-failure also revealed a significant decrease in fracture toughness due to grain boundaries. Specifically, the fracture toughness decreased by around 30%, from 4.1 +/- 0.4 MPa m1/2 for epitaxial microstructure to 3.0 +/- 0.3 MPa m1/2 for columnar-grained structure. The fracture toughness of columnar-grained structure is 3.0 +/- 0.2 MPa m1/2 perpendicular to the growth direction higher than 2.7 +/- 0.1 MPa m1/2 along it. These findings suggest that future optimization of hard coatings should focus on grain boundary toughening, and the present toolbox proposes suitable techniques for such microstructure optimization.</description>

      <title>Inverse Diffusion Approximation for Extraction of Scattering and Absorption Coefficients in Highly Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon transport through a diffusing slab can be described by the radiative transfer equation (RTE). When the slab is highly scattering and weakly absorbing, the RTE simplifies to the diffusion equation. In this paper, an inverse diffusion approximation (IDA) method is numerically developed to determine the optical properties (reduced scattering $\mu'_s$ and absorption coefficient $\mu_a$) of a homogeneous slab using simple reflectance and transmission measurements with a spectrometer. The reflectance and transmission of a diffusing slab with an arbitrary thickness can then be predicted by solving the forward problem by using the calculated $\mu'_s$ and $\mu_a$. Our method is validated both numerically, by directly comparing with Monte-Carlo simulations, and experimentally, by comparing with measurements on ZnO/PDMS and TiO$_2$/PDMS composite polymer films with varying thicknesses. The IDA method is also applied to distinguish between different types of tissue. Overall, our method could be used to guide the design of radiative cooling reflectors, or lighting and optical display diffusers for applications in medical imaging and other fields.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Photonics on a Chip: Monolithically Integrated Terahertz Optoelectronics based on Quantum Well Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a monolithically integrated terahertz optoelectronics (MITO) platform that uses quantum well (QW) structures to enable tunable terahertz signal generation and detection on a single chip. Through photomixing in QW PIN photodiodes, the MITO platform achieves terahertz generation and detection with substantially enhanced power efficiency and sensitivity over previous devices. By integrating semiconductor optical amplifiers, lasers, modulators, filters, demultiplexers, and other passive optical components with photomixers using commercially available photonic integrated circuit foundry processes, this platform supports the development of compact, scalable terahertz systems capable of high-speed data transfer, spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. This advancement positions terahertz technology for widespread use, facilitating practical applications across remote sensing, communications, and medical diagnostics within portable devices.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Time Interfaces in Wire Media: Innovations for Subwavelength Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study temporal interfaces between media with strong spatial dispersion and dielectrics. In particular, we consider a temporal discontinuity that transforms a wire medium sample, a metamaterial with resonant spatial dispersion, into a uniaxial dielectric. We show that this transition results in a transformation of the deeply subwavelength spatial spectrum of TEM waves propagating in the wire medium at a certain frequency into a spectrum of plane waves at new frequencies that are all higher than the initial one. The waves at different frequencies propagate in different directions. Their complex amplitudes and propagation directions are uniquely related to the amplitudes of the spatial harmonics of the fields which existed before the transition. We explain how to implement this transition. The revealed effect may result in a promising method of subwavelength imaging.</description>

      <title>Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D&lt;1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Design of Dual-Band Plasmonic Absorber for Biomedical Sensing and Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a dual-band plasmonic absorber designed for simultaneous sensing applications in the near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions. The absorber, composed of silver nanostructures on a metal plate with a dielectric spacer, exhibits a combination of localized and gap surface plasmon resonances, resulting in two distinct absorption peaks in theoretical analysis based on the FDTD method. Numerical simulations also validate the sensor's high refractive index sensitivity, enabling the detection of biomolecules, proteins, viruses, and various solutes in aqueous solutions. The absorber demonstrates significant resonance shifts, making it a promising candidate for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Micrometer-resolution fluorescence and lifetime mappings of CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal films coupled with a TiO$_2$ grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing light emission from perovskite nanocrystal (NC) films is essential in light-emitting devices, as their conventional stacks often restrict the escape of emitted light. This work addresses this challenge by employing a TiO$_2$ grating to enhance light extraction and shape the emission of CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal films. Angle-resolved photoluminescence (PL) demonstrated a tenfold increase in emission intensity by coupling the Bloch resonances of the grating with the spontaneous emission of the perovskite NCs. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) provided micrometer-resolution mapping of both PL intensity and lifetime across a large area, revealing a decrease in PL lifetime from 8.2 ns for NC films on glass to 6.1 ns on the TiO$_2$ grating. Back focal plane (BFP) spectroscopy confirmed how the Bloch resonances transformed the unpolarized, spatially incoherent emission of NCs into polarized and directed light. These findings provide further insights into the interactions between dielectric nanostructures and perovskite NC films, offering possible pathways for designing better performing perovskite optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Manipulation of Sound with a Multi-material 3D-Printed Origami Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The challenge in reconfigurable manipulation of sound waves using metasurfaces lies in achieving precise control over acoustic behavior while developing efficient and practical tuning methods for structural configurations. However, most studies on reconfigurable acoustic metasurfaces rely on cumbersome and time-consuming control systems. These approaches often struggle with fabrication techniques, as conventional methods face limitations such as restricted material choices, challenges in achieving complex geometries, and difficulties in incorporating flexible components. This paper proposes a novel approach for developing a reconfigurable metasurface inspired by the Kresling origami pattern, designed for programmable manipulation of acoustic waves at an operating frequency of 2000 Hz. The origami unit cell is fabricated using multi-material 3D printing technology, allowing for the simultaneous printing of two materials with different mechanical properties, thus creating a bistable origami-based structure. Through optimization, two equilibrium states achieve a reflection phase difference of {\pi} through the application of small axial force, F, or torque, T. Various configurations of the metasurface, generated from different combinations of these two equilibria, enable distinct reflective behaviors with switchable and programmable functionalities. The principle of this work simplifies the shaping of acoustic waves through a straightforward mechanical mechanism, eliminating the need for complex control systems and time-consuming adjustments. This innovative approach paves a novel and effective perspective for developing on-demand switchable and tunable devices across diverse fields, including electromagnetics, mechanics, and elastics, leveraging multi-material printing technology.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation depth. For the first time, we reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss of &lt;2 dB/cm, high precision exceeding 6-bits, large modulation depth with an index change as large as 4.6x10-3. Additionally, these devices offer impressive stability, maintaining minimal wavelength variation for over three weeks and enduring more than 10,000 cycles, and require a mere 0.8 pJ of energy for non-volatile operation. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical modulation. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed (48 Gbps) and energy-efficient (450 fJ/bit) signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>
