      <title>The quest for new materials: the network theory and machine learning perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and predicting the emergence of novel materials is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics, materials science and technology. With the rapid growth of materials databases in both size and reliability, the challenge shifts from data collection to efficient exploration of this vast and complex space. A key strategy lies in a smart use of descriptors at multiple scales, ranging from atomic arrangements to macroscopic properties, to represent materials in high-dimensional abstract spaces. Network theory provides a powerful framework to structure and analyze these relationships, capturing hidden patterns and guiding discovery. Machine Learning complements this approach by enabling predictive modeling, dimensionality reduction, and the identification of promising material candidates. By integrating network-based methods with Machine Learning techniques, researchers can construct, analyze, and efficiently navigate the material space, uncovering novel materials with tailored properties. This review explores the synergy between network theory and ML, highlighting their role in accelerating materials discovery through a systematic and interpretable approach.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent dissipation effects in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation fundamentally alters quantum transport in Josephson junctions. Here, we demonstrate unique transport signatures in dissipative topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, which provide a powerful platform for exploring the competition between dissipation and topological protection. We incorporate dissipation effects by coupling a `lossy' metallic lead at the junction to an electron reservoir, and describe its effects using an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian within the Lindblad formalism. Non-Hermiticity introduces finite lifetimes to the helical Andreev bound states in the junction, with imaginary energy components that depend on the quasiparticle incidence angle, while Klein tunneling remains robust for normal incidence. Unlike `ordinary' non-Hermitian Josephson junctions, this system exhibits no Josephson gaps or forbidden regions, preserving topological protection. In the fully non-Hermitian regime, a tunable line of zero-energy states emerges, bounded by exceptional-like points with divergent supercurrents. Our results reveal how dissipation reshapes superconducting transport in topological insulator-based Josephson junctions, opening new directions for dissipation-engineered hybrid quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement behavior and localization properties in monitored fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic bipartite entanglement in various integrable and nonintegrable models of monitored fermions. We find that, for the integrable cases, the entanglement versus the system size is well fitted, over more than one order of magnitude, by a function interpolating between a linear and a power-law behavior. Up to the sizes we are able to reach, a logarithmic growth of the entanglement can be also captured by the same fit with a very small power-law exponent. We thus propose a characterization of the various entanglement phases using the fitting parameters. For the nonintegrable cases, as the staggered t-V and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, the numerics prevents us from spanning different orders of magnitude in the size, therefore we fit the asymptotic entanglement versus the measurement strength and then look at the scaling with the size of the fitting parameters. We find two different behaviors: for the SYK we observe a volume-law growth, while for the t-V model some traces of an entanglement transition emerge. In the latter models, we study the localization properties in the Hilbert space through the inverse participation ratio, finding an anomalous delocalization with no relation with the entanglement properties. Finally, we show that our function fits very well the fermionic logarithmic negativity of a quadratic model in ladder geometry with stroboscopic projective measurements.</description>
