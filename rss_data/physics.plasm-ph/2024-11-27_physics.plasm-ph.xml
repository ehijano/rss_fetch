      <title>All-optical compact setup for generation of collimated multi-MeV proton beams with a "snail" target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$ T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$ MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Improved Bethe-Heitler positron creation and retention by combining direct laser acceleration and solid target interaction within a gas jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of Petawatt-class lasers presents the opportunity to study positron production and acceleration experimentally, in an all-optical setting. Several configurations were proposed to produce and accelerate positrons in a single laser stage. However, these configurations have yielded limited positron beam quality and low particle count. This paper presents methods for improving the injection and retention of positrons obtained via Bethe-Heitler pair production and accelerated using direct laser acceleration (DLA) in a plasma channel. The work first introduces a semi-analytical model which predicts laser energy depletion in this highly nonlinear regime. We demonstrate through PIC simulations that accelerated electrons can induce charge inversion within the channel, leading to positron trapping and acceleration. We investigate how laser focusing position, channel wall density, target foil position and target thickness influence positron creation and retention. Our configuration can achieve an 8-fold increase in positron retention compared to previous studies and a higher number of positrons produced overall. This work establishes a robust, single-stage approach for obtaining positron beams, opening new avenues for experiments with Petawatt-class lasers and potential applications in electron-positron collisions and QED cascades.</description>

      <title>Relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration of electrons at large-amplitude standing whistler waves during laser-plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between a thin foil target and a circularly polarized laser light injected along an external magnetic field is investigated numerically by particle-in-cell simulations. A standing wave appears at the front surface of the target, overlapping the injected and partially reflected waves. Hot electrons are efficiently generated at the standing wave due to the relativistic two-wave resonant acceleration if the magnetic field amplitude of the standing wave is larger than the ambient field. A bifurcation occurs in the gyration motion of electrons, allowing all electrons with non-relativistic velocities to acquire relativistic energy through the cyclotron resonance. The optimal conditions for the highest energy and the most significant fraction of hot electrons are derived precisely through a simple analysis of test-particle trajectories in the standing wave. Since the number of hot electrons increases drastically by many orders of magnitude compared to the conventional unmagnetized cases, this acceleration could be a great advantage in laser-driven ion acceleration and its applications.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Simulation of the Fokker-Planck Equation applied to Quantum Radiation Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-future experiments with Petawatt class lasers are expected to produce a high flux of gamma-ray photons and electron-positron pairs through Strong Field Quantum Electrodynamical processes. Simulations of the expected regime of laser-matter interaction are computationally intensive due to the disparity of the spatial and temporal scales and because quantum and classical descriptions need to be accounted for simultaneously (classical for collective effects and quantum for nearly-instantaneous events of hard photon emission and pair creation). A typical configuration for experiments is a scattering of an electron and a laser beam which can be mapped to an equivalent problem with constant magnetic field. We study the stochastic cooling of an electron beam in a strong constant uniform magnetic field, both its particle distribution functions and their energy momenta. We start by obtaining approximate closed-form analytical solutions to the relevant observables. Then, we apply the quantum-hybrid Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution to the Fokker-Planck equation describing this process, and compare against theory and results from Particle-In-Cell simulations and classical Partial Differential Equation solvers, showing good agreement. This work will be useful as a first step towards quantum simulation of plasma physics scenarios where diffusion processes are important, in particular in strong electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Broadband coherent XUV light from $e^-/e^+$ microbunching in an intense laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond pulses of coherent extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light are instrumental for studying sub-atomic dynamics, and are often produced from a free electron laser (FEL) by electron microbunches in an undulator. An optical-FEL (OFEL) utilizes a counter-propagating laser pulse instead of an undulator, and has been proposed as a more compact and tunable source than a FEL. Yet, an OFEL is difficult to realize because of the high electron density required and subsequent high emittance. We demonstrate that broadband coherent XUV light, which in the temporal domain corresponds to a train of attosecond pulses with 8-as duration at 92-as intervals, can be generated by microbunching of relativistic electrons and positrons in an optical laser pulse. The symmetry between electrons and positrons in the bunch stabilizes the system and enables the rapid formation of dense microbunches over a ten-micrometer distance instead of the tens of meters typically required in an undulator. The high microbunch density and the stable spectral phase up to emitted photon energies of about 350 eV, allow for the creation of orders of magnitude more compact sources of XUV light that could be employed in physics, chemistry, biology, and industry.</description>

      <title>Cyclic phase transition of substrate-modulated 2D dusty plasma driven by oscillatory forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Langevin dynamical simulations are performed to investigate the formation of clusters and voids of a two-dimensional-periodic-substrate (2DPS) modulated two-dimensional dusty plasma (2DDP) driven by an oscillatory force. It is discovered that, as the frequency of the oscillatory force decreases gradually, the substrate-modulated 2DDP undergoes the cyclic transition of the ordered cluster and void phases. Between the observed ordered cluster and void phases, the studied 2DDP exhibits a more uniform arrangement of particles. The discovered cyclic transition is attributed to the symmetry of the time-averaged potential landscape due to the 2DPS in the reference frame of the moving particle, as confirmed by superimposing the particle locations on the effective potential landscape under various conditions.</description>

      <title>AC-Augmented Dielectric Barrier Discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators generate an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) force through the ionization and acceleration of charged species. Most active flow control DBD applications are only practical at lower Reynolds numbers, and increasing the momentum injection can extend the practical uses of the technology. Here, we experimentally demonstrate improvement in the performance of a planar DBD actuator by utilizing an AC-augmented electrical field in a three-electrode geometry. Time-resolved electrical and optical measurements, velocity profiles, and direct thrust measurements were used to characterize the EHD augmentation. Varying phase shift and E-field strength between the two air-exposed DBD electrodes can accelerate EHD flow and increase EHD forcing by up to ~ 40%. At the most favorable conditions, the maximum thrust was 54 mN/m when the air-exposed electrodes were out of phase. In-phase operation of the exposed electrodes at high E-field conditions can induce adverse effects and sliding discharge. Mechanistically, the performance improvements in the AC-augmented DBD actuator primarily come from the additional charge pull action by the third electrode. The insight into the AC-augmented DBD mechanism allows for developing multi-stage arrays capable of further increasing EHD forces.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal tapering in meter-scale gas jets for increased efficiency of laser plasma accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern laser plasma accelerators (LPAs) often require meter-scale plasma waveguides to propagate a high-intensity drive laser pulse. Tapering the longitudinal gas density profile in meter-scale gas jets could allow for single stage laser plasma acceleration well beyond 10 GeV with current petawatt-class laser systems. Via simulation and interferometry measurements, we show density control by longitudinally adjusting the throat width and jet angle. Density profiles appropriate for tapering were calculated analytically and via particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, and were matched experimentally. These simulations show that tapering can increase electron beam energy using 19 J laser energy from $\sim$9 GeV to $&gt;$12 GeV in a 30 cm plasma, and the accelerated charge by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Unified description of structure and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Skyrme model Sk$\chi$450 constrained by the chiral effective field theory and the ground-state energies of doubly-magic nuclei, we explore the macroscopic static energy spectrum of dense matter. Structure of the matter is idealized as 1-, 2- or 3-dimensional periodic Coulomb lattices (pasta phases) at average baryon density in the range of $0.005n_0-0.5n_0$ with $n_0\sim0.16$ fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to the inner crust of neutron stars. In the earlier work, the bulk and the surface nuclear properties in this scenario were described on the basis of different nuclear interactions. As a result, predictions for the inner crust structure based on those numerical results are not necessarily self-consistent. In this work, we solve this problem by describing the nuclear properties and proton-proton Cooper pairing in a unified manner, \emph{i.e.} based on the same nuclear interaction. We calculate the surface tension to the leading order (planar surface) and to the next-to-leading order (from nonzero principal curvature) at the Extended Thomas-Fermi level. Next, we develop and solve a system of equations within the compressible liquid drop model (LDM), which provides us with all necessary information about the macroscopic static energy spectrum of the nuclear structure. We find that the curvature corrections change the ground state in a relevant way. We also find that, typically, the energy differences between the different pasta phases are less than the thermal energy for temperatures $\sim10^8-10^9$ K, which implies that the real nuclear pasta phases are likely polymorphic. Finally, for 1-dimensional pasta phase we evaluate the superconducting coherence length of protons, the London penetration depth and the superconducting energy gap. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the pasta phases.</description>

Abstract: Intense femtosecond laser pulses interacting with solids can drive electrons to relativistic energies, enabling miniaturized particle accelerators and bright extreme-ultraviolet light sources. In-situ space-time control of these electrons is crucial for developing next-generation laser-based accelerators but remains extremely challenging. We present a novel approach to achieve such control by manipulating the local fields driving these electrons using a nanoengineered dielectric nanopillar target. We demonstrate via experiments and simulations that this sub-femtosecond and nanometer-scale control enables enhanced electron acceleration and control of the directionality of relativistic electrons over a wide angular range and predicts the coherent formation of sub-femtosecond electron bunches from the nanopillars. This research bridges nanophotonics and strong-field plasma physics, offering new opportunities for in-situ control of high-energy particles and advancements in plasma technology.</description>

      <title>Observation and characterisation of trapped electron modes in Wendelstein 7-X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past, quasi coherent modes were reported for nearly all tokamaks. The general definition describes modes as quasi coherent when the magnitude squared coherence is in the range of \SIrange{0.3}{0.6}{}. Quasi coherent modes are observed in the plasma core as well as in the plasma edge and can have quite different physical origins. The one in the core are observed in plasmas with low collisionality, where the electron temperature exceeds the ion temperature in the plasma core. This is the case for electron cyclotron heating in general. The origin of these modes are electrons trapped within a magnetic mirror, as reported in the past from various fusion devices. The so-called trapped-electron modes (TEMs) belong to drift wave instabilities and can be destabilized by electron-temperature gradients in the plasma core. From the diagnostic point of view, quasi coherent modes appear as fluctuations in electron density and temperature. Therefore, the microwave reflectometer is very well suited to monitor these modes. This paper describes experiments, conducted at the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator (W7-X), which aim at detecting quasi coherent modes at low wave numbers. A Poloidal Correlation Reflectometer (PCR) installed at W7-X, is able to measure low wave numbers ($k_\perp\le 3.5$ cm$^{-1}$). For different magnetic configurations and plasma parameters, broad quasi-coherent structures are observed in the coherence spectra. From the analysis of the rotation and the poloidal structure, these quasi coherent (QC) modes show the properties of electron-temperature-gradient driven TEMs. A linear relation between the mode velocity and the rotation frequency is found. The relation is uniform and confirms the nature of QC-mode observation as TEM in tokamaks, too.</description>

      <title>A novel understanding of the role of plasma-molecular kinetics on divertor power exhaust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During detachment, a buffer of neutral atoms and molecules builds up between the target and the ionising plasma. Collisions between the plasma and the molecules play an important role in the detachment process. Studies of plasma-molecular kinetics indicate that the gas temperature is increased during detachment for a wide range of conditions on the MAST-U and TCV tokamaks. This is related to an increased $\mathrm{D}_2$ lifetime during detachment, leading to more plasma-molecule collisions that raise the molecular temperature. Such collisions subsequently result in significant power and momentum losses to the divertor plasma during detachment. Using a simplified inference, these losses are estimated using the rotational temperature, neutral pressure and ionisation front position. Significant power losses (about $10\%$ of $P_{SOL}$) and dominant momentum losses (majority of the upstream pressure) from plasma-molecule collisions are inferred experimentally in long-legged, strongly baffled, detached divertors (MAST-U Super-X divertor), consistent with SOLPS-ITER simulations. The vibrational distribution obtained is compared with an Eirene-like collisional-radiative model setup, indicating some qualitative agreements and disagreements, potentially highlighting model gaps.
  These interpretations highlight the importance of plasma-molecular collisions, leading to power and momentum losses during detachment. Our analysis and reduced modelling of these processes provide further insights into detachment control observations, the workings of long-legged divertors and divertor power balance.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and modulation of cosmic ray modified magnetosonic waves in a galactic gaseous rotating plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influence of the presence of cosmic fluid on the magnetosonic waves and modulation instabilities in the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is investigated. The fluid model is developed by modifying the pressure equation in such dissipative rotating magnetoplasmas incorporating thermal ionized gas and cosmic rays. Applying the normal mode analysis, a modified dispersion relation is derived to study linear magnetosonic wave modes and their instabilities. The cosmic rays influence the wave damping by accelerating the damping rate. The standard reductive perturbation method is employed in the fluid model leading to a Korteweg de Vries Burgers (KdVB) equation in the small-amplitude limit. Several nonlinear wave shapes are assessed by solving the KdVB equation, analytically and numerically. The cosmic ray diffusivity and magnetic resistivity are responsible for the generation of shock waves. The modulational instability (MI) and the rogue wave solutions of the magnetosonic waves are studied by deriving a nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation from the obtained KdVB equation under the assumption that the cosmic ray diffusion and magnetic resistivity are weak and the carrier wave frequency is considerably lower than the wave frequency. The influence of various plasma parameters on the growth rate of MI is examined. The modification of the pressure term due to cosmic fluid reduces the MI growth in the interstellar medium. In addition, a quantitative analysis of the characteristics of rogue wave solutions is presented. Our investigation's applicability to the interstellar medium of spiral galaxies is traced out.</description>

Abstract: The gyro-kinetic model is an approximation of the Vlasov-Maxwell system in a strongly magnetized magnetic field. We propose a new algorithm for solving it combining the Semi-Lagrangian (SL) method and the Arakawa (AKW) scheme with a time-integrator. Both methods are successfully used in practice for different kinds of applications, in our case, we combine them by first decomposing the problem into a fast (parallel) and a slow (perpendicular) dynamical system. The SL approach and the AKW scheme will be used to solve respectively the fast and the slow subsystems. Compared to the scheme in [1], where the entire model is solved using only the SL method, our goal is to replace the method used in the slow subsystem by the AKW scheme, in order to improve the conservation of the physical constants.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale energy transfer from fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves to kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In space plasmas, large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves can drive compressive perturbations, accelerate ion beams, and lead to plasma heating and the excitation of ion acoustic waves at kinetic scales. This energy channelling from fluid to kinetic scales represents a complementary path to the classical turbulent cascade. Here, we present observational and computational evidence to validate this hypothesis by simultaneously resolving the fluid-scale Alfv\'en waves, kinetic-scale ion acoustic waves, and their imprints on ion velocity distributions in the Earth's magnetopause boundary layer. We show that two coexisting compressive modes, driven by the magnetic pressure gradients of Alfv\'en waves, not only accelerate the ion tail population to the Alfv\'en velocity, but also heat the ion core population near the ion acoustic velocity and generate Debye-scale ion acoustic waves. Thus, Alfv\'en-acoustic energy channeling emerges as a viable mechanism for plasma heating near plasma boundaries where large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves are present.</description>
