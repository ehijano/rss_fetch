      <title>The emergence of bulk structure in clusters via isotropic multi-well pair potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical, optical, and chemical properties of a wide variety of soft materials are enabled and constrained by their bulk structure. How this structure emerges at small system sizes during self-assembly has been the subject of decades of research, with the aim of designing and controlling material functionality. Despite these efforts, it is still not fundamentally understood how nontrivial interparticle interactions in a finite $N$-body system influence resultant structure, and how that structure depends on $N$. In this study, we investigate the emergence of non-close packings using multi-well isotropic pair potentials to simulate finite cluster formation of four distinct two-dimensional crystal structures. These pair potentials encode multiple preferred length scales into the system, allowing us to understand how anisotropic structural motifs -- as opposed to close-packing -- emerge as cluster size $N$ increases. We find a tendency toward close-packing at small system sizes irrespective of the bulk structure; however, the system size at which bulk structure emerges is influenced by the coordination number of the bulk and the shape of the pair potential. Anisotropic structure emerges through the formation of bonds at a secondary bonding length at larger system sizes, and it is also dependent upon the shape of the pair potential. Our findings demonstrate that tuning particle-particle interactions can enable the engineering of nano- or mesoscale soft matter clusters, in applications as diverse as drug delivery and hierarchical materials design.</description>

      <title>Why does safety glass bubble?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laminated safety glass (LSG) is a composite assembly of glass and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a viscoelastic polymer. LSG can be found in building facades, important landmarks around the world, and every major form of transportation. Yet, the assembly suffers from unwanted bubbles which are anathema to one of the most important features of glass: optical transparency. In here, we present an in-depth study of the reasons behind these bubbles, either during high-temperature quality control tests or normal glass operating conditions. We provide a physical model for bubble growth that deals with two gases, thermal effects on gas solubility and diffusivity, and a time-temperature dependent rheology. The model can be extended to n-component bubbles or other materials beyond PVB. By combining experiments and theory, we show that two gases are at play: air trapped in interfacial bubbles in the assembly during lamination and water initially dissolved in the polymer bulk. Both gases work in tandem to induce bubble growth in finished assemblies of LSG provided that (i) the original bubble nucleus has a critical size and (ii) the polymer relaxes (softens) sufficiently enough, especially at elevated temperatures. The latter constraints are relaxed in a condition we termed anomalous air oversaturation that may even trigger a catastrophic, yet beautiful ice flower instability.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck information swimmers with external and internal feedback controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an underdamped active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle, we propose two information swimmer models having either external or internal feedback control and perform their numerical simulations. Depending on the velocity that is measured after every fixed time interval (measurement time), the friction coefficient is modified in the externally controlled model, whereas the persistence time for the activity is changed in the internally controlled one. In the steady state, both of these information swimmers acquire finite average velocities in the noisy environment, and the efficiency can be maximized by tuning the measurement time. The internally controlled swimmer is more relevant to biological systems and can generally achieve larger average velocity and efficiency than the externally controlled model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Aggregation Processes and Electrophysical Properties of Transformer Oil-Based Magnetic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fluids exhibit tunable structures and electrophysical properties, making them promising for adaptive optical systems, biomedical sensors, and microelectromechanical devices. However, the dynamic evolution of their microstructure under varying magnetic fields remains insufficiently explored.
  This study investigates the structural and dielectric properties of transformer oil-based magnetic fluids containing 0.2-10 vol% magnetite nanoparticles, across a frequency range of 20 Hz to 10 MHz. Particular attention is given to the dynamics of aggregate reorientation in response to alternating magnetic fields. Experimental results demonstrate that low nanoparticle concentrations lead to a linear increase in dielectric permittivity and conductivity, consistent with the Maxwell-Wagner model. In contrast, higher concentrations exhibit conductivity saturation and dispersion effects due to the formation of elongated aggregates.
  An analysis based on the Boyle polarization model describes the relaxation and structural changes associated with aggregation dynamics. Changes in the magnetic field orientation induce aggregate reconfiguration and significant structural transformations. At early stages, elongated chains form, subsequently thickening until an equilibrium state is reached. Elevated temperatures accelerate these processes by reducing medium viscosity and aggregate order.
  The findings highlight the critical role of reorientation dynamics in designing high-speed magnetic sensors, vibration isolation systems, and adaptive devices operating in dynamic magnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic methods for confined fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and microstructure of confined fluids with small particle number are best described using the canonical ensemble. However, practical calculations can usually only be performed in the grand-canonical ensemble, which can introduce unphysical artifacts. We employ the method of asymptotics to transform grand-canonical observables to the canonical ensemble, where the former can be conveniently obtained using the classical density functional theory of inhomogeneous fluids. By formulating the ensemble transformation as a contour integral in the complex fugacity plane we reveal the influence of the Yang-Lee zeros in determining the form and convergence properties of the asymptotic series. The theory is employed to develop expansions for the canonical partition function and the canonical one-body density. Numerical investigations are then performed using an exactly soluble one-dimensional model system of hard-rods.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal distribution of the glycoprotein pherophorin II reveals stochastic geometry of the growing ECM of $Volvox~carteri$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of multicellularity involved the transformation of a simple cell wall of unicellular ancestors into a complex, multifunctional extracellular matrix (ECM). A suitable model organism to study the formation and expansion of an ECM during ontogenesis is the multicellular green alga $Volvox~carteri$, which, along with the related volvocine algae, produces a complex, self-organized ECM composed of multiple substructures. These self-assembled ECMs primarily consist of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, a major component of which is pherophorins. To investigate the geometry of the growing ECM, we fused the $yfp$ gene with the gene for pherophorin II (PhII) in $V.~carteri$. Confocal microscopy reveals PhII:YFP localization at key structures within the ECM, including the boundaries of compartments surrounding each somatic cell and the outer surface of the organism. Image analysis during the life cycle allows the stochastic geometry of those growing compartments to be quantified. We find that their areas and aspect ratios exhibit robust gamma distributions and exhibit a transition from a tight polygonal to a looser acircular packing geometry with stable eccentricity over time, evoking parallels and distinctions with the behavior of hydrated foams. These results provide a quantitative benchmark for addressing a general, open question in biology: How do cells produce structures external to themselves in a robust and accurate manner?</description>

      <title>Locomotion of a Scallop-Inspired Swimmer in Granular Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding swimming in soft yielding media is challenging due to their complex deformation response to the swimmer's motion. We experimentally show that a scallop-inspired swimmer with reciprocally flapping wings generates locomotion in granular matter. This disagrees with the scallop theorem prohibiting reciprocal swimming in a liquid when its inertia is negligible. We use X-ray tomography and laser profilometry to show that the propulsion is created by the combined effects of jamming and convection of particles near the wings, which break the symmetry in packing density, surface deformation, and kinematics of the granular medium between an opening and a closing stroke.</description>

      <title>Soft cells, Kelvin's foam and the minimal surface of Schwarz</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article we introduced a new class of shapes, called \emph{soft cells} which fill space as \emph{soft tilings} without gaps and overlaps while minimizing the number of sharp corners. We defined the \textit{edge bending algorithm} deforming a polyhedral tiling into a soft tiling and we proved that by this algorithm an infinite class of polyhedral tilings can be smoothly deformed into soft tilings. Using the algorithm we constructed the soft versions of all Dirichlet-Voronoi cells associated with point lattices in two and three dimensions; for brevity we will refer to the soft cells produced by the edge bending algorithm as the \textit{standard} soft cells. Here we show that the edge bending algorithm has at least one alternative which is specific to one particular polyhedral tiling. By using the Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling based on the $bcc$ lattice, we demonstrate a new type of soft cell which is non-standard, i.e. it can not be produced by the universal edge bending algorithm and it shows a marked difference compared to the standard soft cell with identical combinatorial properties. We use the new, tiling-specific algorithm to construct a one parameter family of space-filling cells, the end members of which are soft cells and one member of which is the Kelvin cell. By using the same, tiling-specific algorithm we point out the connection of the new, non-standard soft cells to Schwarz minimal surfaces. Our findings indicate that soft cells may be identified by algorithms which are specific for the tiling. Also, results show that not only soft cells themselves, but also the geometric constructions resulting in soft cells could be of immediate interest when studying natural shapes.</description>

      <title>Polymyxin B-Enriched Exogenous Lung Surfactant: Thermodynamics and Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of exogenous pulmonary surfactant (EPS) to deliver other relevant drugs to the lung is a promising strategy for combined therapy. We evaluated the interaction of polymyxin B (PxB) with clinically used EPS, the poractant alfa Curosurf (PSUR). The effect of PxB on the protein-free model system (MS) composed of four phospholipids (diC16:0PC/16:0-18:1PC/16:0-18:2PC/16:0-18:1PG) was examined in parallel to distinguish the specificity of the composition of PSUR. We used several experimental techniques (differential scanning calorimetry, small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering, small angle neutron scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrophoretic light scattering) to characterize the binding of PxB to both EPS. Electrostatic interactions PxB -EPS are dominant. The results obtained support the concept of cationic PxB molecules lying on the surface of the PSUR bilayer, strengthening the multilamellar structure of the PSUR as derived from SAXS and SANS. A protein-free MS mimics natural EPS well but was found to be less resistant to penetration of PxB into the lipid bilayer. PxB does not affect the gel-to-fluid phase transition temperature Tm of PSUR, while Tm increased by ~ +2 $^\circ$C in MS. The decrease of the thickness of the lipid bilayer (dL) of PSUR upon PxB binding is negligible. The hydrophobic tail of the PxB molecule does not penetrate the bilayer as derived from SANS data analysis and changes in lateral pressure monitored by excimer fluorescence at two depths of the hydrophobic region of the bilayer. Changes in dL of protein-free MS show a biphasic dependence on the adsorbed amount of PxB with a minimum close to the point of electroneutrality of the mixture. Our results do not discourage the concept of a combined treatment with PxBenriched Curosurf. However, the amount of PxB must be carefully assessed (less than 5 wt% relative to the mass of the surfactant) to avoid inversion of the surface charge of the membrane.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>

      <title>Confinement determines transport of a reaction-diffusion active matter front</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Couplings between biochemical and mechanical processes have a profound impact on embryonic development. However, in-vitro studies capable of quantifying these interactions have remained elusive. Here, we investigate a synthetic system where a DNA reaction-diffusion (RD) front is advected by a turbulent flow generated by active matter (AM) flows in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry. Whereas the dynamics of simple RD fronts solely depend on the reaction and diffusion rates, we show that RD-AM front propagation is also influenced by the confinement geometry. We first experimentally dissected the different components of the reaction-diffusion-advection process by knocking out reaction or advection and observed how RD-AM allows for faster transport over large distances, avoiding dilution. We then show how confinement impacts active matter flow: while changes in instantaneous flow velocities are small; correlation times are dramatically increased with decreasing confinement. As a result, RD-AM front speed increased up to 8-fold compared to a RD one, in quantitative agreement with a conveyor belt RDA theoretical model. The RD-AM experimental system described here provides a framework for the rational engineering of complex spatiotemporal processes observed in living systems. It will reinforce our understanding of how macro-scale patterns and structures emerge from microscopic components in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equilibrium states and ordering regimes of a quasi-one-dimensional system of hard superdisks (anisotropic particles interpolating between disks and squares) where the centers of the particles are constrained to move on a line. A continuous change from a quasi-isotropic to a tetratic regime is found upon increasing the density. Somewhat unexpected, for isobaric states, systems with larger and more anisotropic particles in the tetratic regime are denser than systems with smaller and less anisotropic particles in a quasi-isotropic regime. Close packing behaviour is characterised by exponents describing the behaviour of the pressure, the angular fluctuations and the angular correlation length. We obtain two universal, shape-independent relations between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann approach to collective motion via nonlocal visual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual cues play crucial roles in the collective motion of animals, birds, fish, and insects. The interaction mediated by visual information is essentially non-local and has many-body nature due to occlusion, which poses a challenging problem in modeling the emergent collective behavior. In this paper, we introduce a Boltzmann-equation approach incorporating non-local visual interaction. Occlusion is treated in a self-consistent manner via a coarse-grained density field, which renders the interaction effectively pairwise. Our model also incorporates the recent finding that each organism stochastically selects a neighbor to interact at each instant. We analytically derive the order-disorder transition point, and show that the visual screening effect raises the transition threshold, which does not vanish when the density of the agents or the range of the intrinsic interaction is taken to infinity. Our analysis suggests that the model exhibits a discontinuous transition as in the local interaction models, and but the discontinuity is weakened by the non-locality. Our study clarifies the essential role of non-locality in the visual interactions among moving organisms.</description>
