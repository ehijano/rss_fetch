      <title>Effect of substrate miscut angle on critical thickness, structural and electronic properties of MBE-grown NbN films on c-plane sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the structural and electronic properties of niobium nitride (NbN) thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy on c-plane sapphire with miscut angles of $0.5^\text{o}$, $2^\text{o}$, $4^\text{o}$, and $10^\text{o}$ towards m-axis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans reveal that the full width at half maximum of the rocking curves around the 1 1 1 reflection of these NbN films decreases with increasing miscut. Starting from 76 arcsecs on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut, the FWHM reduces to almost 20 arcsecs on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire indicating improved structural quality. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images indicate that NbN on c-sapphire has around 10 nm critical thickness, irrespective of the substrate miscut, above which it turns columnar. The improved structural property is correlated with a marginal increment in superconducting transition temperature $T_\text{c}$ from 12.1 K for NbN on $0.5^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire to 12.5 K for NbN on $10^\text{o}$ miscut sapphire.</description>

      <title>Full Shapiro spectroscopy of current-phase relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting the current-phase relationship (CPR) of a single superconducting junction is challenging in practice and traditionally involves embedding the junction in a larger superconducting circuit containing SQUIDs and/or resonators. Applying ac driving to the junction has proven to be a viable and less invasive way to extract information about the few lowest harmonics of the CPR, by locating the integer and fractional Shapiro steps in the IV-curve of the driven junction. Here, we present an alternative driving-based method that allows to extract the full harmonic content of a CPR in a non-invasive way, by fitting the measured critical currents of the driven junction as a function of driving power. We test our method, both using numerical simulations and in experiments, and we show that it works very accurately, also in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We feature out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and tripling phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. As for the in-vacuum case, the three-body clustering is always the lowest-lying phase. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper tripling phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Measuring Reactive-Load Impedance with Transmission-Line Resonators Beyond the Perturbative Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.</description>

      <title>Pair-mixing induced Time-reversal-breaking superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental evidences of spontaneous time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking have been reported for the superconducting ground state in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductor 4H$_b$-TaS$_2$ or chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ hybrid superlattices, and is regarded as evidence of emergent chiral superconductivity. However, the $T_c$ of these TMD superconductors is of the same order as pristine 1H or 2H-TaS$_2$, which do not show any signature of TR breaking and are believed to be conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. To resolve this puzzle, we propose a new type of pair-mixing state that mixes the dominant conventional s-wave pairing channel with the subdominant chiral p-wave pairing channel via a finite Cooper-pair momentum, based on symmetry analysis within the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis shows that the fourth-order terms in the chiral p-wave channel can lead to a variety of pair-mixing states with spontaneous TR breaking. These TR-breaking superconducting states also reveal a zero-field, junction-free superconducting diode effect that is observed in chiral molecule intercalated TaS$_2$ superlattices.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized transport and quantum phase transitions in one-dimensional superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a one-dimensional electronic nanodevice inspired in recently fabricated semiconductor-superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator (SE-SC-FMI) hybrid heterostructures, and investigate its zero-temperature transport properties. While previous related studies have primarily focused on the potential for generating topological superconductors hosting Majorana fermions, we propose an alternative application: using these hybrids to explore controllable quantum phase transitions (QPTs) detectable through transport measurements. Our study highlights two key differences from existing devices: first, the length of the FMI layer is shorter than that of the SE-SC heterostructure, introducing an inhomogeneous Zeeman interaction with significant effects on the induced Andreev bound states (ABS). Second, we focus on semiconductor nanowires with minimal or no Rashba spin-orbit interaction, allowing for the induction of spin-polarized ABS and high-spin quantum ground states. We show that the device can be tuned across spin- and fermion parity-changing QPTs by adjusting the FMI layer length orange and/or by applying a global backgate voltage, with zero-energy crossings of subgap ABS as signatures of these transitions. Our findings suggest that these effects are experimentally accessible and offer a robust platform for studying quantum phase transitions in hybrid nanowires.</description>

      <title>Emergent Pair Density Wave Order Across a Lifshitz Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the telltale signs of pair-density-wave order (PDW) in the Kondo-Heisenberg chain by focusing on the momentum resolved spectrum in different parameter regimes. Density matrix renormalization group calculations reveal that this phase is characterized by a dispersion with two minima and four Fermi points, indicating the emergence of an effective next-nearest-neighbor hopping that arises as a second-order effect to avoid magnetic frustration. The pairs appear in the spectrum as in-gap bound states with weight concentrated in the hole pockets. The low-energy physics can be understood by means of a generalized t-J model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping. Our results offer a guide for searching for experimental signatures, and for other models that can realize PDW physics.</description>

      <title>Designing Topological High-Order Van Hove Singularities: Twisted Bilayer Kagom\'e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of high-order Van Hove singularities and topology plays a central role in determining the nature of the electronic correlations governing the phase of a system with unique signatures characterising their presence. Layered van der Waals heterostuctures are ideal systems for band engineering through the use of twisting and proximity effects. Here, we use symmetry to demonstrate how twisted Kagom\'e bilayers can host topological high-order Van Hove singularities. We study a commensurate system with a large twist angle and demonstrate how the initial choice of high-symmetry stacking order can greatly influence the electronic structure and topology of the system. We, furthermore, study the sublattice interference in the system. Our results illustrate the rich energy landscape of twisted Kagom\'e bilayers and unveil large Chern numbers (of order 10), establishing twisted bilayer Kagom\'e as a natural playground for probing the mixing of strong correlations and topology.</description>
