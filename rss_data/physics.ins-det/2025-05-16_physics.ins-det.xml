      <title>First-ever detection of microseismic activity with a tonne-scale cryogenic experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrations from experimental setups and the environment are a persistent source of noise for low-temperature calorimeters searching for rare events, including neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay or dark matter interactions. Such noise can significantly limit experimental sensitivity to the physics case under investigation. Here we report the first detection of marine microseismic vibrations using mK-scale calorimeters. This study employs a multi-device analysis correlating data from CUORE, the leading experiment in the search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with mK-scale calorimeters and the Copernicus Earth Observation program, revealing the seasonal impact of Mediterranean Sea activity on CUORE's energy thresholds, resolution, and sensitivity over four years. The detection of marine microseisms underscores the need to address faint environmental noise in ultra-sensitive experiments. Understanding how such noise couples to the detector and developing mitigation strategies is essential for next-generation experiments. We demonstrate one such strategy: a noise decorrelation algorithm implemented in CUORE using auxiliary sensors, which reduces vibrational noise and improves detector performance. Enhancing sensitivity to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and to rare events with low-energy signatures requires identifying unresolved noise sources, advancing noise reduction methods, and improving vibration suppression systems, all of which inform the design of next-generation rare event experiments.</description>

      <title>Test of LGAD as Potential Next-Generation {\mu}SR Spectrometer Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance ({\mu}SR) is a versatile and powerful non-destructive technology for investigating the magnetic properties of materials at the microscopic level. The {\mu}SR technique typically utilizes fully spin polarized beams of positive muons generated at particle accelerator facilities and measures the evolution of the muon spin polarization inside a sample to extract information about the local magnetic environment in materials. With the development of accelerator technologies, intensities of muon beams are being continuously improved, which will cause a pile-up problem to the {\mu}SR spectrometer. The first muon source in China, named MELODY, is currently under construction and will be a pulsed source of muons operated at a repetition frequency of only 1 Hz due to limitations of the accelerator system at CSNS. Consequently, there is a strong motivation to operate MELODY at significantly higher muon intensities. This necessitates an upgrade of the detector system inside the spectrometer, which should be smaller and faster to accommodate the increased intensity per pulse of muons. The Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD), characterized by a typical pulse width of 2 ns and a segmentation size in the centimeters range, has the potential to significantly improve the counting rates of {\mu}SR spectrometers that utilize a high intensity pulsed muon source. Thus, it is expected that the LGAD detector is a promising candidate to enhance the performance of {\mu}SR spectrometers at the new MELODY muon source.To validate this, tests on the LGAD were conducted at the ISIS pulsed muon source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. This paper will describe the setup of the candidate LGAD devices and the subsequent analysis of the experiment data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the impact of the diode edge geometry on the effective active area of silicon sensors using AREA-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensors for particle tracking detectors are required to provide a maximum active area in addition to fulfilling performance criteria concerning radiation hardness, charge collection and operating conditions (e.g. leakage current, depletion voltage and breakdown voltage). While the requirement for optimised coverage within the tracking detector necessitates a slim sensor edge between active region and physical sensor edge, wider edge regions were found to be beneficial for the sensor performance during an early prototyping phase. In order to study the impact of differently sized edge regions, test structures were used to compare their individual active regions.
  Measurements of each diode were performed using a micro-focused X-ray beam to map its respective active area. This paper presents measurements of these test structures using AREA-X showing that the active area of a silicon particle tracking sensor does not only depend on the size of its bias ring, but also the size and configuration of its edge structure.</description>

      <title>Metal oxide decoration on Si-FETs for selective gas sensing at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal oxide semiconductors have been thoroughly studied for gas sensing applications due to the electrical transduction phenomenon in the presence of gaseous analytes. The chemiresistive sensors prevalent in the applications have several challenges associated with them inclusive of instability, longevity, temperature/humidity sensitivity, and power consumption due to the need of heaters. Herein, we present a silicon field effect transistor-based gas sensor functionalized with CuO. The oxidized Cu thin film acts as a selective room temperature H2S sensor with impressive response and recovery. Using this methodology, we propose a standalone compact enose based on our results for a wide spectrum of gas detection.</description>

      <title>Photomultiplier Requirements and Pre-Calibration for the SABRE South Liquid Scintillator Veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the oil-proof base Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the SABRE South linear-alkylbenzene liquid scintillator veto. SABRE South is a dark matter direct detection experiment at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, aiming to test the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter annual modulation signal. We discuss the requirements of the liquid scintillator system and its photomultipliers, outline the methods and analysis used for the characterisation measurements, and results from initial tests. We discuss the impact of these measurements on the performance of the active veto system and explore analysis methods to allow for low threshold operation. Finally, we include results from a small scale liquid scintillator detector prototype used to assess the future performance of pulse shape discrimination in the liquid scintillator veto, and how well accommodated it is by the R5912 PMTs.</description>

      <title>Pixel column issue in the ATLAS Inner Tracker modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel modules are currently being built for the ATLAS ITk Pixel detector upgrade. During the preproduction phase, recurring chip malfunctioning was observed during electrical testing. It was possible to bypass this issue by disabling some pixel core columns in the ITkPix readout chip. Therefore the issue is called "core column issue" which is a direct disqualifier for a pixel module. A concerning number of cases has been observed in pixel modules with ITkPix v1.1 as well as v2 chips which significantly impacts the module yield. However, the behaviour is erratic and there is not any evidence hinting at the origin of this issue. These proceedings outline the investigations of the issue, highlighting the electrical behaviour during testing, present findings from the data collected via our production database and through visual inspection, and point towards possible causes of the issue.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of tilt sensing using a homodyne quadrature interferometric translational sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observation in space will demand improvement in the sensitivity of the local sensor for the drag-free control. This paper presents the proposal, design, and demonstration of a new laser interferometric sensor named Quadrature Interferometric Metrology of Translation and Tilt (QUIMETT) for the drag-free local sensor. QUIMETT enables simultaneous measurements of both translational displacement and tilts of a reflective object with a single interferometer package. QUIMETT offers a characteristic feature where the sensitivity to tilt is independent of the interference condition while maintaining the ability to measure the translational displacement for a range greater than the laser wavelength. The tilt-sensing function has been demonstrated in a prototype experiment. The tilt sensitivity remained unchanged in different interference conditions and stayed at 10 nrad/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>The H2M Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor -- characterizing non-uniform in-pixel response in a 65 nm CMOS imaging technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high energy physics community recently gained access to the TPSCo 65 nm ISC (Image Sensor CMOS), which enables a higher in-pixel logic density in monolithic active pixel sensors (MAPS) compared to processes with larger feature sizes. To explore this novel technology, the Hybrid-to-Monolithic (H2M) test chip has been designed and manufactured. The design followed a digital-on-top design workflow and ports a hybrid pixel-detector architecture, with digital pulse processing in each pixel, into a monolithic chip. The chip matrix consists of 64$\times$16 square pixels with a size of 35$\times$35 um2, and a total active area of approximately 1.25 um2. The chip has been successfully integrated into the Caribou DAQ system. It is fully functional, and the measured threshold dispersion and noise agree with the expectation from front-end simulations. However, a non-uniform in-pixel response related to the size and location of the n-wells in the analog circuitry has been observed in test beam measurements and will be discussed in this contribution. This asymmetry in the pixel response, enhanced by the 35 um pixel pitch - larger than in other prototypes - and certain features of the readout circuit, has not been observed in prototypes with smaller pixel pitches in this technology.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>
