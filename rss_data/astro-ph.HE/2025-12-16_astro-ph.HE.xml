      <title>Probing jet-induced optical variability across timescales in radio-loud NLSy1 galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate optical variability across multiple timescales in a sample of radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert~1 (RL-NLSy1) galaxies, including $\gamma$-ray detected, $\gamma$-ray undetected, and non-jetted systems along with a comparison set of highly polarised core-dominated quasars (HPQs). Using Zwicky Transient Facility light curves, we measure fractional variability ($F_{\rm var}$) and rest-frame structure functions (SFs) to test whether short-term jet-linked variability is reflected in long-term behaviour. $\gamma$-ray detected RL-NLSy1s and HPQs show steeply rising SFs, revealing strong long-term coherence despite modest $F_{\rm var}$, consistent with Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission from relativistic jets. Non-jetted RL-NLSy1s exhibit the highest $F_{\rm var}$ but plateauing SFs, indicative of stochastic, disc-driven fluctuations lacking long-term coherence. $\gamma$-ray undetected RL-NLSy1s show the lowest $F_{\rm var}$ and nearly flat SFs, consistent with weak or absent jet activity across all timescales. Colour-magnitude trends show that jet-dominated sources exhibit redder-when-brighter behaviour, whereas disc-dominated systems exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends. These results show that SF-derived temporal coherence, rather than variability amplitude alone, is a promising diagnostic of jet dominance and orientation, offering a framework for interpreting AGN variability in forthcoming time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Detection of Partial Coherence due to Multipath Propagation for FRB 20220413B with CHIME/FRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are a $\sim$ millisecond-long transient phenomenon that propagate across extragalactic distances and are effectively a point source. Radio wave propagation through inhomogeneous distributions of plasma can act as a lens, generating multiple images of the emitted electric field. A lens can produce images of a point source where the phase of the electric field between images remains coherent when observed by a radio telescope. FRB 20220413B shows a complicated pulse structure with time separated components that may be image copies of the main components due to plasma lensing. We perform several analyses to determine if FRB 20220413B is consistent with expectations of a plasma lensed FRB. We analyze and fit the morphology of the burst to a plasma lens model and find consistency in the spectro-temporal profile but not the observed flux. Using the complex-valued channelized voltage data from the CHIME telescope, we perform a time-lag correlation analysis and report correlation signatures present in the electric field of FRB 20220413B. We find that there exists an excess correlation signature only in absolute power and not in phase. We perform a frequency-lag correlation analysis on the spectra of all subcomponents of the burst and find a consistent scintillation bandwidth across all components. We find the scintillation bandwidth is consistent with expectations of scattering due to the Milky Way. We interpret this as all burst components propagating through the same scintillation screen located in the Milky Way, which would generate the excess variance signature observed, even in the absence of phase coherence between burst components. We find that while the burst morphology can be modeled by a plasma lens, the coherent signature present in the time-lag correlation is consistent with the expectations of a common scattering screen, but not coherent plasma lensing.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Probes of the Supermassive Black Hole Binary Population: The Role of Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By inferring the gravitational wave background (GWB) from a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) enable the study of massive black holes. In many ways, PTAs manifest the promise of a multimessenger approach to astronomy: they can constrain SMBHB population characteristics that are otherwise difficult to constrain using electromagnetic observations, such as hardening mechanisms at sub-parsec separations. In this work, we quantify this multimessenger promise using Bayesian inference of many realizations of simulated PTA data, while adopting a model for the SMBHBs that has been successfully applied to the 15-year data set of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Our analyses of 200 realistic, simulated NANOGrav data sets show that there is a greater than 50\% chance of reducing the prior uncertainty in the SMBHB hardening rate by more than 50\%, and in the SMBHB evolutionary lifetime by 25--75\%. Additionally, there is an 88\% chance that PTA data can reduce the prior uncertainty in the characteristic mass variable of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by 25--50\%. For $M_{\text{BH}}$--$M_{\text{Bulge}}$ parameters (in a model without redshift evolution) and the overall normalization parameter of the GSMF, PTA data can provide only marginal information gain beyond the constraints from electromagnetic observations. Our work delineates the domains over which electromagnetic and gravitational-wave data constrain the demographics and dynamics of the supermassive black-hole binary population, offering a clearer picture of the impact of population multi-messenger astrophysics probes with PTAs.</description>

      <title>The maximum offsets of binary neutron star mergers from host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically derive, and illustrate with a population synthesis model, the maximum offset of binary neutron star mergers ejected from their host galaxies. This approximate maximum offset is 300 kpc $\times\ (v_\mathrm{esc} / 500\ \mathrm{km}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1})^{-7}$, where $v_\mathrm{esc}$ is the escape velocity from the host galaxy. Massive hosts with high escape velocities are unlikely to yield very large offsets. This maximum offset should inform the host associations of mergers that are not coincident with galaxies. We also discuss potential correlations between offsets and system masses, and possibly the duration of the gamma-ray burst accompanying the merger.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni precludes a strong NiCu cycle in Type-I X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-observation comparisons of type-I X-ray bursts (XRBs) can reveal the properties of accreting neutron star systems, including the neutron star compactness. XRBs are powered by nuclear burning and a handful of reactions have been shown to impact the model results. Reactions in the NiCu cycles, featuring a competition between $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni, have been shown to be among the most important reactions as they are a critical checkpoint in $rp$-process flow and significantly impact the light curves and burst ashes. We report a direct measurement of $^{59}$Cu($p$,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni bringing stringent constraints on this reaction rate. New results rule out a strong NiCu cycle in XRBs, with a negligible degree of recycling, $\leq$5\% up to 1.5 GK. The new reaction rate, when varied within new uncertainty limits, shows no impact on one-zone XRB model light-curves tailored for clocked-burster $\tt{GS 1826-24}$, hence removing an important nuclear physics uncertainty in the model-observation comparison.</description>

      <title>Inference of Neutron Star Mass Distributions and the Equation of State from Multi-messenger Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass rather than a nuisance parameter from the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytrope-like EoSs, the maximum mass posterior shifts from $M_\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\odot$ at the 90% confidence level. This change in prior also impacts the posterior for the shape of the mass distribution of NSs in LMXBs.</description>

      <title>Constraining the dark matter origin of the halo-like 20 GeV $\gamma$-ray excess with the AMS-02 antiproton data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently, a significant $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo has been reported and a dark matter origin has been suggested. The inferred dark matter parameters are $ m_\chi \sim 0.5-0.8 $ TeV and $ \langle \sigma v \rangle \sim (5-8) \times 10^{-25}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$ for the $ b\bar{b} $ channel. If correct, prominent antiproton emission is produced and can be directly tested by the AMS-02 data. In this work we calculate the corresponding antiproton emission and show that the expected flux at $\sim 100$ GeV is already above the AMS-02 observation. A proper treatment on the antiproton background resulting from the high energy cosmic ray propagation would suggest an annihilation cross section of $&lt; 2\times 10^{-26}~{\rm cm^3~s^{-1}}$, which is a few$\times 10$ times lower than that needed to interpret the potential signal. We therefore conclude that the $\sim 20$ GeV gamma-ray excess in the Milky Way halo is not a viable dark matter signal.</description>

      <title>The Merger Rate of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The merger rate of primordial black hole (PBH) binaries can be used to understand the source population of the merging black hole binaries observable through gravitational-waves (GWs) and also to constrain the possible contribution of PBHs to dark matter. In the literature, the PBH merger rate is calculated analytically, assuming that PBH binaries stay in isolation (i.e. are unperturbed) and evolve solely via GW emission during their entire lifetime. However, if some or all of dark matter consists of PBHs, then as cosmic structures grow, PBH binaries and single PBHs fall inside dark matter halos. In those halos, the PBH binaries' interactions with their environment significantly affect the subsequent evolution of their orbital properties. In this paper, we present a numerical framework that accurately calculates the total PBH merger rate by combining the evolution of isolated binaries outside halos with the dynamics of binaries inside halos. In our work we have found that the isolated binary channel is suppressed at low redshifts and dynamical interactions in halos reshape the merger rate evolution with time, accelerating some mergers. At redshifts of $\lesssim 2$ the total merger rate is a factor of $\simeq 50 \%$ higher than the results assuming that all PBH binaries effectively stay unperturbed until their merger. Our simulations provide a definitive calculation on the total PBH merger rates, that are currently being probed and constrained from gravitational-wave observations. We make our merger rates publicly available at Zenodo</description>

      <title>NICER Magnetar Burst Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive catalog of short bursts from magnetars based on eight years of NICER observations. A total of 1130 bursts were identified, making this the largest magnetar burst catalog to date. The sample is dominated by SGR 1935+2154, which contributes 76% of all detected bursts. We analyzed burst durations, spectral properties, and their correlations across multiple sources. Bursts from SGR 1935+2154 exhibit significantly longer durations, with a mean of 317 ms, compared to a mean of 23 ms for bursts from other magnetars. Two microsecond-scale bursts were detected for the first time, originating from 1E 1048.1-5937 and CXOU J010043.1-721134. Spectral analysis in the 0.5--8 keV range using both blackbody and power-law models shows that bursts with higher fluences have harder spectra. In contrast, correlations between burst duration and spectral parameters are weak or absent. This catalog provides a valuable dataset for studying magnetar short bursts, enabling future modeling efforts and improving our understanding of the diversity and physical mechanisms of magnetar bursts.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Self-bound Equation of State on the Structure of Rotating Compact Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates how a self bound equation of state (EOS), which describes strange quark stars, affects the rotational properties of compact stars, focusing on deviations from universal relations governing gravitational mass and radius changes due to rotation. The analysis reveals significant deviations in stars with higher surface-to-center total energy-density ratios, $\frac{\epsilon_s}{\epsilon_c+c^2P_c}$, challenging the established universal relations.
  For Newtonian stars, hydrostatic equilibrium ensures that the difference between the gravitational potential at the center, $\Phi_c$, and at the poles, $\Phi_p$, remains constant within sequences of rotating neutron stars characterized by the same central and polar specific enthalpy ($\Phi_c - \Phi_p = -h_c +h_p$). Combined with the scaling $\Phi \propto R_e^2$, where $R_e$ denotes the equatorial radius, this condition naturally leads to a quasi-universal behavior in the rotational change of radius within these sequences. Similarly, in general relativistic stars, the hydrostatic equilibrium maintains that $\Phi^{GR}_{p} - \Phi^{GR}_{c}$ remains unchanged within these sequences, where $\Phi^{GR}$ is one of the metric potentials.
  Inspired by this theoretical framework, a toy model has been developed to capture the dependence of gravitational mass and radius deviations on the surface-to-central total energy density ratio. Subsequently, an improved set of empirical universal relations has been proposed, for accurately modeling rapidly rotating compact stars with self-bound EOSs.</description>

      <title>eROSITA-RU Tidal Disruption Events with Keck-I/LRIS: Sample Selection, Optical Properties, and Host Galaxy Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We select seventy tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates among X-ray transients discovered during the eROSITA all-sky surveys in the Eastern Galactic hemisphere between December 2020 and February 2022 (eRASS1--5). We cross-match each X-ray source to a host galaxy in archival optical surveys using Bayesian likelihood-ratio techniques and obtain Keck/LRIS spectroscopy for all 70 host galaxies. Host properties are inferred through SED fitting with Prospector and emission line analysis with pPXF. We develop a robust classification scheme using X-ray and broad line luminosities, narrow-line ionization diagnostics, and optical variability to identify high-confidence TDEs, for which we analyze optical spectral features, light curve properties, and host galaxy demographics. Our final sample contains 52 TDEs with redshifts of $0.018 \leq z\leq0.714$, comprising 41 gold (high-confidence) and 11 silver (lower-confidence) events. The vast majority (93\%) of gold TDEs are intrinsically brighter in the X-ray band, with $L_{\rm X,peak} &gt; L_{\rm opt,peak}$. Among 23 events with detected optical flares, delayed X-ray peak is commonly observed. We identify transient spectral features in eight events, including six with prominent broad \ion{He}{II} $\lambda$4686 and/or H$\alpha$ emission and two coronal-line TDEs. Host galaxy demographics reveal modest over-representation in green valley ($\times1.8$) and quiescent Balmer-strong ($\times5.3$) galaxies, significantly weaker than previous TDE samples, demonstrating greater diversity in star formation histories than previously recognized. Most TDE hosts exhibit suppressed star formation relative to the main sequence, consistent with X-ray selection biases against dusty star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Readdressing the contribution of photonuclear reactions to the muon content of extensive air showers: a heuristic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect ground-based observations of cosmic rays through extensive air showers in modern experiments typically involve the use of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the characteristics of the primary particles. These simulations necessitate assumptions about particle interactions at energies that have not yet been experimentally probed, which introduces systematic uncertainties in key observables, particularly the number of muons. Current research on this uncertainty primarily focuses on hadronic interaction models, the dominant source of muon production. This study presents an approach that takes into account another significant mechanism for muon generation: photonuclear reactions. A robust heuristic technique has been developed to estimate the contribution of these interactions to the total number of muons over a wide range of extensive air shower parameters (including primary particle type, energy, and slant atmospheric depth) and photonuclear interaction models, with an absolute percentage error on the order of $10\%$ in the estimated number of muons. Furthermore, several potential applications of the suggested method in relation to modern challenges in extensive air shower physics are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies of transonic accretion onto black holes reveal a wide range of possible solutions, broadly classified into smooth flows and flows featuring shocks. Accretion solutions that involve the formation of shocks are particularly intriguing, as they are expected to naturally produce observable variability features. However, despite their theoretical significance, time-dependent studies exploring the stability and evolution of such shocked solutions remain relatively scarce. To address this gap, we perform simulations of transonic accretion flows around a black hole in ideal magneto-hydrodynamic framework. Our simulations are initialized using boundary conditions derived from semi-analytical hydrodynamical models, allowing us to explore the stability of these flows under varying magnetic field strengths. The presence of magnetic fields modifies the dynamics of the accretion flow through magnetic pressure, and the resulting force imbalance induces oscillations in the position of shock front. Our results show that variations in the emitted luminosity arising from shock oscillations appear as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), a characteristic feature commonly observed in accreting black holes. We find that the QPO frequency is determined by the radial position of the shock front: oscillations occurring closer to the black hole produce frequencies of tens of hertz, whereas shocks located farther out yield sub-hertz frequencies</description>

      <title>Constraint on magnetized black bounce spacetime from HFQPOs data and the selection of resonance models via information criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper primarily explores the dynamics of charged particle in the magnetized SV spacetime, and constrains the parameters of the SV spacetime along with its surrounding magnetic fields. The constraints are given by using $\chi^2$ analysis combined with high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) data observed from three microquasars: GRS 1915+105, XTE 1550-564, and GRO J1655-40. The results indicate that the magnetic field significantly influences the position of the innermost stable circular orbit of charged particle and frequency distribution of epicyclic motion, which excites more resonance model variants, enhancing observational effects. Additionally, we employ the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to evaluate resonance model and its various variants. The support for different models from observational data shows significant variation: $E R_8$ as the best model is supported strongly, $ER_3$ model has moderate evidence of support, $ER_6$ and $ER_7$ models are considerably less support, while other resonance models have essentially no support. For models more supported by the observational data, the allowed ranges of the regularization parameter: $0\leq a&lt;0.736$ ($68\%$ confidence level) suggests that HFQPOs data support the magnetized black bounce spacetime as a regular black hole, and the smaller value of the regularization parameter indicates a possibility of the presence of quantum effects. According to the constraint results, we get the best-fit values of magnetic field strength around $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$ GS for electrons and around $10^{-2}\sim 10^{-1}$ GS for protons. Finally, as a comparison, we test the SV spacetime without a magnetic field using microquasar observational data, and the calculated results of AIC show that this case is incompatible with the HFQPOs data, further supporting the existence of a magnetic field in SV spacetime.</description>

      <title>A Search for Soft $\gamma$-ray Emission from the Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell 3667) Using INTEGRAL/ISGRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for soft $\gamma$-ray emission from the merging galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 (Abell~3667) using archival INTEGRAL/ISGRI observations. This cluster located at $z=0.0556$ hosts prominent radio relics associated with merger-driven shocks, suggesting the presence of relativistic electrons capable of producing inverse-Compton (IC) emission in the 30--300~keV band. Using standard OSA~11.2 imaging and spectral pipelines and a total effective exposure of 2506~s, we find no significant emission at the cluster position in any energy interval. The extracted ISGRI spectrum is consistent with pure background, and no physically meaningful model parameters can be constrained. From the mosaic variance maps, we derive a conservative $3\sigma$ upper limit of $F_{30-300\,\mathrm{keV}} &lt; 6.9 \times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$ assuming a power-law spectrum with $\Gamma = 2$. This limit rules out bright IC scenarios and constrains the efficiency of merger-driven particle acceleration in SPT-CL J2012-5649. Our results provide the most stringent soft $\gamma$-ray constraint on this system to date and highlight the need for next-generation hard X-ray missions, such as HEX-P or eXTP, to probe IC emission at theoretically predicted levels in merging clusters.</description>

      <title>Probing Periodic and Aperiodic Variability of X-ray Sources in M31, M81 and Centaurus A with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on archival Chandra observations, we present a systematic timing survey of several hundred X-ray sources in M31, M81, and Centaurus A, mostly low-mass X-ray binaries (LXMBs), focusing on searching and characterizing aperiodic and periodic variability within single observation. We identify flares in 24 sources in M31, 5 in M81, and 26 in Cen~A; several display recurrent events. Flare durations span from tens of seconds to a few $10^{4}$ s, with peak luminosities of $10^{37}$-$10^{40}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$ and low flare duty cycles of $4.9\times10^{-6}$-$3.5\times10^{-2}$. Dipping events are found in 8 sources in M31, 1 in M81, and 5 in Cen A, including two repeaters. On multi-epoch baselines, the standard deviation of the source luminosity correlates linearly with the mean luminosity, with a coefficient of 0.49 (M31), 0.30 (M81), and 0.67 (Cen A), indicating galaxy-to-galaxy diversity. No statistically significant periodic signals are detected in M81 or Cen A, which, along with several periodic signals previously found among the M31 sources, can be understood considering a joint effect of our detection sensitivity and intrinsic distributions of the orbital period and X-ray luminosity of LMXBs. The ensemble of short-duty-cycle flares, a mix of recurrent and isolated dips, and galaxy-dependent rms--flux factor, supports a picture in which stochastic accretion-rate fluctuations modulate luminosity on $\sim$10-$10^{4}$ s. Conducted at known distances and across distinct host environments, this extragalactic survey provides uniform flare/dip samples and rms-flux scalings for bulge-dominated fields, offering empirical constraints for accretion physics and illustrating the promise of timing analyses in external galaxies using the Chandra archive.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration in Magnetized Shear-Driven Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear flows, ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, can accelerate particles through turbulence excited by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We present the first numerical study of particle acceleration in non-relativistic, magnetized, and purely shear-driven turbulence that includes full particle backreaction. Using two-dimensional MHD-PIC simulations with an initially uniform flow-aligned magnetic field and external stirring force, we demonstrate that sustained particle acceleration requires continuously driven turbulence, whereas freely decaying turbulence rapidly depletes its energy reservoirs and halts the acceleration. The acceleration mechanism operates through the systematic distortion of gyro-orbits by turbulent electric fields: acceleration phases extend the particle trajectory along the electric force, increasing the energy gain, while deceleration phases shorten the trajectory, reducing the energy loss. This asymmetry produces net energy gain despite stochastic fluctuations, with the mean energy change scaling quadratically with shear velocity, characteristic of second-order Fermi acceleration. Initially monoenergetic particles develop substantial non-thermal tails after the turbulence onset. For particles repeatedly crossing shear layers, their energization follows geometric Brownian motion with weak systematic drift, yielding a log-normal distribution. High-energy particles exhibit pitch-angle anisotropy, becoming preferentially perpendicular to the flow-aligned magnetic field as their gyroradii exceed the turbulent layer width. These results establish shear-driven turbulence as a viable particle acceleration mechanism, providing a general model for particle energization in shear flows.</description>

      <title>DAO: A New and Public Non-Relativistic Reflection Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new non-relativistic reflection model, DAO, designed to calculate reflection spectra in the rest frame of accretion disks in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The model couples the XSTAR code, which treats atomic processes, with the Feautrier method for solving the radiative transfer equation. A key feature of DAO is the incorporation of a high-temperature corrected cross section and an exact redistribution function to accurately treat Compton scattering. Furthermore, the model accommodates arbitrary illuminating spectra, enabling applications across diverse physical conditions. We investigate the spectral dependence on key physical parameters and benchmark the results against the widely used reflionx and xillver codes.</description>

      <title>Disentangling AGN Feedback and Sloshing in the Perseus Cluster with XRISM: Insights from Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM has revealed complex, non-monotonic velocity dispersion profiles in the Perseus cluster, pointing to a complex interplay between at least two physical drivers of motions caused by dynamical processes within the intracluster medium (ICM). To further explore this conclusion, we perform a suite of idealized, controlled simulations targeting the relative roles of merger-induced sloshing and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Our models systematically isolate and combine these mechanisms to predict observable velocity profiles and X-ray line shapes, providing direct comparison to XRISM and Hitomi data. We find that neither sloshing nor AGN activity alone can reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile; only their combined action matches the elevated dispersions both at the cluster core and outskirts. Power-spectrum analysis reveals distinct spatial signatures: sloshing generates large-scale coherent motions, while AGN feedback injects turbulence and broadens the velocity spectrum at small scales, especially in the core. By forward-modeling spectral line profiles, we show how these dynamics imprint unique observational signatures on X-ray emission. Our results underscore the necessity of accounting for both large-scale and small-scale drivers of gas motions in the ICM when interpreting high-resolution spectroscopic data, and provide guidance for the analysis of forthcoming XRISM observations.</description>

      <title>The TRAPUM Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT II: 12 new discoveries and timing solutions for 7 pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of 12 new radio pulsars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as part of the TRAPUM (TRAnsients and PUlsars with MeerKAT) Large Survey Project, using the MeerKAT L-band receivers (856--1712\,MHz). These pulsars, discovered in 18 new pointings with 2\,hour integration times, bring the total number of pulsars identified by this ongoing survey to 19 (yielding a total of 44 LMC radio pulsars now known), representing an 80 per cent increase in the LMC radio pulsar population to date. These include PSR\,J0454$-$6927, the slowest extragalactic radio pulsar discovered to date, with a spin period of 2238\,ms, and PSR\,J0452$-$6921, which exhibits the highest dispersion measure (DM) among extragalactic radio pulsars, at 326\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. The fastest spin period among the new discoveries is 245\,ms, and the lowest DM is 62\,pc\,cm$^{-3}$. We also present timing results for our first pulsar discoveries with MeerKAT and the Murriyang radio telescope, obtaining phase-connected solutions for seven pulsars in the LMC. These results indicate that the pulsars are isolated, canonical radio pulsars with characteristic ages up to 8.8\,Myr</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Accretion Geometry: a Remarkable Stability of the Hidden Ultraluminous X-Ray Source Cygnus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the average and orbital phase-resolved polarization of Cyg X-3 in the hard state during the 2023 Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observational campaign. We find the polarization degree of $ 21.2 \pm 0.4 \% $ and polarization angle of $ 92.2 \pm 0.5^\circ $, well compatible with the first hard-state IXPE observation in 2022. As the observed polarization depends on both the accretion geometry and the X-ray emission mechanism, which we attribute to reflection from the optically thick envelope surrounding the central source, our result indicates that both are very stable on year-long timescale. We discuss time- and energy-dependent polarization properties and their implications for the geometry and stability of the accretion funnel.</description>

      <title>X-ray Variability and Photosphere Evolution during Accretion Disk Formation in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) originates from both accretion and shocks, which produce photons that eventually emerge from an inhomogeneous photosphere. In this work, we model the disk formation following the debris stream self-intersection in a TDE. We track the multi-band emission using three-dimensional, frequency-integrated and multi-group radiation hydrodynamic simulations. We find a more circularized disk forms about 24 days following the initial stream-stream collision, after the mass fallback rate peaks and once the debris stream density decreases. Despite the absence of a circularized disk at early times, various shocks and the asymmetric photosphere are sufficient to drive a wide range of optical-to-X-ray ratios and soft-X-ray variability. We find that with strong apsidal precession, the first light is from the stream-stream collision. It launches an optically-thick outflow, but only produces modest prompt emission. The subsequent optical and ultraviolet (UV) light curve rise is mainly powered by shocks in the turbulent accretion flow close to the black hole. The optical-UV luminosity peaks roughly when the disk forms and shock-driven outflows subside. The disk is optically and geometrically thick, extending well beyond the circularization radius. Radiation pressure clears the polar region and leaves optically-thin channels. We obtain the broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) directly from multi-group simulations with 16-20 frequency groups. The SED has a black body component that peaks in the extreme UV. The soft X-ray component either resembles a thermal tail, or can be described by a shallower power law associated with bulk Compton scattering. The blackbody parameters are broadly consistent with observed optical TDEs and vary weakly with viewing angle. In contrast, soft X-ray emission is highly angle-dependent.</description>

      <title>The disk precession in a Be star-magnetar binary and its application to the rotation measure of FRB 20201124A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, millisecond-duration radio bursts with poorly known origins. Most FRB sources are detected only once, while some are repeaters. Variation patterns observed in the rotation measure (RM) of some repeaters -- indicate that the local magneto-ionic environments of these FRB sources are highly dynamic. It has been suggested that a Be star-magnetar binary system is a possible origin for such variation. FRB 20201124A is notable among these sources since it is the most active one and exhibits substantial temporal variations of RM measured by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The physics behind this long-term behavior is poorly understood. Here we propose that, within the framework of the Be star-magnetar binary scenario, the observed variation of RM is attributed to a combination of orbital motion and the precession of the circumstellar disk of the Be star. While a ~785-day precession of the disk contributes to the observed decrease in the amplitude of the variation, our model predicts that the amplitude oscillates with this period.</description>

      <title>Flashing fast: characterising the 2025 outburst of MAXI J1957+032</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAXI J1957+032 is an accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar that shows brief, recurrent outbursts in an ultra-compact ~1 h orbit. We characterise the 2025 outburst using X-ray timing and spectroscopy from XMM-Newton and Swift (and a late-time NuSTAR observation), together with contemporaneous optical photometry from LCO, and compare the spin frequency with the 2022 outburst. Timing searches detect coherent pulsations at ~313.6 Hz with no measurable frequency derivative during the XMM-Newton exposure. Relative to its 2022 outburst, we measure a long-term spin-down of ~-2x10^-14 Hz s^-1, consistent with magnetic-dipole braking in quiescence. The pulse profile is nearly sinusoidal, with significant power at the fundamental, second, and fifth harmonics; the fractional amplitude decreases with increasing flux and shows soft lags up to a few keV. The 0.5-10 keV spectrum is well described by absorbed thermal Comptonisation (photon index ~2.4) plus a cool blackbody (kT ~0.23 keV) consistent with emission from a surface hotspot; no reflection or Fe-line features are detected. Requiring R_m \leq R_co implies B_s ~(0.5-3)x10^8 G for d=(5 \pm 2) kpc and {\xi}=0.3-0.5, below the upper limit from the secular spin-down (B_p \leq 10^9 G), possibly indicating a mildly leaky propeller. The optical emission lies on the neutron-star branch of the L_OIR-L_X relation, consistent with reprocessing in a compact disc. The optical SEDs are broadly flat, while an early red excess suggests a transient jet contribution during the initial hard X-ray phase; an optical peak delayed relative to the X-rays may trace an outward-propagating heating front and rapid disc evolution in these short-lived outbursts.</description>

      <title>Redshift Classification of Optical Gamma-Ray Bursts using Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and serve as powerful probes of the early cosmos. However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Transitional Dynamics: Unveiling the Coexistence and Interplay of Type-B and Type-C QPOs in MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on broadband timing analysis of Insight-HXMT and NICER data from the 2019 outburst of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) MAXI J1348-630, we report the detection of the coexistence and competitive interplay between type-C and type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Specifically, the two QPO types were detected simultaneously but exhibited distinct energy dependencies: the type-C QPO was dominant in the hard X-ray band (10-30 keV), while the type-B QPO was more prominent in the soft X-ray band (1-10 keV). Further analysis reveals that the emergence of the type-C QPO suppresses the strength of the type-B QPO, particularly above 10 keV. Tracking the detailed evolution of these QPOs, we find that the weakening of the type-B QPO coincides with the strengthening of the type-C QPO, indicating a competitive interaction between them. These findings reveal a more complex relationship between type-B and type-C QPOs than previously recognized, suggesting they originate from distinct but interacting physical components within the accretion flow and/or jet, and providing new insights into the dynamics of accretion state transitions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the role of the streaming instability for the cosmic-ray spectrum in the GeV to TeV range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete understanding of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum remains a challenge to theory that must be met by comprehensive modeling efforts. One of these is the subject of the present study, namely, an explanation of the recently discovered spectral hardening at $\sim 300$ GeV with self-consistently treated cosmic-ray diffusion, where self-generated waves resulting from the streaming instability impact the diffusion of high-energy particles. We revisit the corresponding model by Blasi et al. (2012), perform an extensive parameter study, and determine an optimal range of parameters that best fit the cosmic-ray data. We conclude that self-consistently treated cosmic-ray transport remains a competitive alternative to explain the spectral hardening of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at a few hundred GeV.</description>

      <title>Multiband gravitational wave observations of eccentric escaping binary black holes from globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) formed in globular clusters (GCs) are promising sources for multiband gravitational wave (GW) observations, particularly with low- and middle-frequency detectors. These sBBHs can retain detectable eccentricities when they enter the sensitivity bands of low-frequency GW observatories. We study multiband GW observations of eccentric sBBHs that escape from GC models simulated with the MOCCA code, focusing on how low- and middle-frequency detectors can constrain their eccentricities and other parameters. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we generate ten realizations of cosmic sBBHs by combining the MOCCA sample with a cosmological model for GC formation and evolution. We then assess their detectability and the precision of parameter estimation. Our results show that LISA, Taiji, the LISA-Taiji network (LT), and AMIGO could detect $0.8\pm0.7$, $11.6\pm2.0$, $15.4\pm2.7$, and $7.9\pm1.3$ escaping sBBHs, respectively, over four years, while LT-AMIGO could detect $20.6\pm3.0$ multiband sBBHs in the same period. LT and AMIGO can measure initial eccentricities with relative errors of approximately $10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}-0.7$, respectively. Joint LT-AMIGO observations have a similar ability to estimate eccentricities as LT alone.</description>

      <title>The First X-Ray Polarimetry of an Eclipsing Low-Mass X-Ray Binary: Serendipitous IXPE Observation of AX J1745.6-2901</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarimetric measurement of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary system AX J1745.6-2901 conducted by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) satellite. This transient source, located within $ \sim $1.5' of the Galactic center, was observed serendipitously during a MAXI J1744-294 observation with a duration of 150 ks. The complex nature of the region in which AX J1745.6-2901 is located poses a challenge for studying its polarization. By performing a detailed analysis of the contamination from MAXI J1744-294 and the Galactic center diffuse emission, we find the source polarization degree PD = 14.7$\% \pm$ 4.0$\%$ and polarization angle PA = 122$^\circ \pm 8^\circ$. The phase-resolved analysis shows increase in polarization during the eclipse phase, with PD = 34.2$\% \pm$ 8.7$\%$, suggesting that the polarization-inducing mechanisms are of scattering nature, probably originating from disk winds.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation from a nearby subhalo candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent analysis of pulsar timing data has reported evidence for a massive ($\sim 6 \times 10^7 M_{\odot}$) dark matter subhalo located only $\sim 0.8$ kpc from Earth. This candidate implies an exceptionally large $J$-factor of $\sim 10^{23}\,{\rm GeV^2\,cm^{-5}}$, exceeding that of known classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies by orders of magnitude and rivaling the Galactic Center. In this work, we utilize more than 17 years of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data to search for gamma-ray emission from this subhalo. We identify a tentative excess in the region with ambiguous origin. Adopting a conservative strategy, we retain this excess without modeling additional astrophysical components, treating it instead as unmodeled background to derive upper limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section for the $b\bar{b}$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ channels. Despite this conservative treatment, the resulting limits remain stringent due to the exceptionally large $J$-factor. Subject to the dynamical confirmation of the subhalo, these constraints are potentially orders of magnitude stronger than those obtained from combined analyses of dwarf spheroidal galaxies and blind subhalo searches.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical simulations of neutron star cores in the two-fluid MHD approximation: simple configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores is not fully understood. We describe the field evolution both for one barotropic fluid as well as two collisionally coupled barotropic fluids with different density profiles using the anelastic approximation and the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the evolution in three dimensions. In the one-fluid case, a single fluid describes the motion of the charged particles. In the two-fluid model, the neutral fluid is coupled to the electrically conductive fluid by collisions, the latter being dragged by the magnetic field. In this model, both fluids have distinct density profiles. This forces them to move at slightly different velocities, resulting in a relative motion between the two barotropic fluids -- ambipolar diffusion. We develop a code based on Dedalus and study the evolution of simple poloidal dipolar and toroidal magnetic fields. Previous 2D studies found that poloidal magnetic fields evolve towards a stable Grad-Shafranov equilibrium. In our 3D simulations we find an instability of the two-fluid system similar to the one in the barotropic fluid system. After the instability saturates, a highly non-linear Lorentz force introduces small-scale fluid motion that leads to turbulence, development of a cascade and significant, non-axially symmetric changes in the magnetic field configuration. Fluid viscosity plays an essential role in regularizing the small-scale fluid motion, providing an energy drain.</description>

      <title>PSR J0537-6910: Exponential recoveries detected for 12 glitches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar glitches are unresolved increments of the rotation rate that sometimes trigger an enhancement of the spin-down rate. On occasions, the augmented spin-down decays gradually in an exponential manner, particularly after the largest glitch events. The young pulsar PSR J0537-6910 exhibits the highest known glitching rate, with 60 events detected in nearly 18 years of monitoring. Despite most PSR J0537-6910 glitches being large, only one exponential recovery has been reported, following its first discovered glitch. This is puzzling, as pulsars of similar characteristics typically present significant exponential recoveries. We aim to determine whether this reflects an intrinsic difference in PSR J0537-6910 or a detectability issue, for example due to its high glitch frequency. The full dataset, including recent NICER observations, was systematically searched for exponential relaxations. Each glitch was tested for evidence of a recovery over a broad range of trial timescales. Promising candidates were investigated further by comparing recovery models with and without an exponential term using Bayesian evidence. We discovered six new glitches, bringing the total to 66. Our criteria strongly indicates the presence of 11 previously undetected exponential recoveries. We presente updated glitch and timing solutions. Exponential recoveries are detected only for the largest glitches, though not all of them. The inferred timescales range from 4 to 37 d, with the decaying frequency increment generally below $1\%$ of the total. We find that $\ddot\nu$ can remain stable across several glitches, with persistent changes associated with only some events. In particular, it tends to be lowest after glitches with exponential recoveries, yielding inter-glitch braking indices between 6 and 9. Following glitches without recoveries, $\ddot\nu$ is higher, leading to braking indices between 10 and 35.</description>

      <title>Multi-Method Timing of Transient Radio Pulsars with the GBT350 and GBNCC Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the timing solutions for three radio pulsars discovered with the Green Bank North Celestial Cap (GBNCC) and 350-MHz Green Bank Telescope drift-scan surveys. These pulsars were initially discovered through their single-pulse emission and therefore designated as rotating radio transients (RRATs). Follow-up timing campaigns yielded a number of higher signal-to-noise summed pulse profiles for each pulsar, allowing us to obtain timing solutions both through single pulses as well as the standard method of time-integrating the pulsar's emission. We find that the two methods return timing parameters which are usually in agreement within two standard deviations, and have similar sized error bars. The single-pulse timing solutions have significantly higher RMS errors and reduced chi-squared values, likely due to pulse jitter. The distribution of wait times between detected single pulses indicates a significant amount of pulse clustering in time on short timescales from all three sources. For all sources, the presence of low-level emission outside of the sparse bright pulses and lack of giant pulses is more reminiscent of highly nulling canonical radio pulsars than extremely transient RRATs, highlighting the diversity of emission behavior observed from sources published as RRATs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the X-ray Secrets of Fermi-detected Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies with XMM-Newton Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the innermost regions of active galactic nuclei, where the accretion disk, corona, and jet processes are closely coupled, X-ray observations offer a direct probe to study the physics of disk-jet coupling and the mechanisms driving relativistic outflows. We present a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray timing and spectral variability of 16 Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies detected by Fermi-LAT, based on 29 epochs of XMM-Newton observations. A moderate intraday flux variability is observed throughout the sample, with fractional variability ranging from 5 to 16\%. The temporal study of 1H\,0323+342 reveals a distinctive turnover timescale in structure functions, along with notable variations in flux and power spectral density slopes. The hardness ratio in some epochs demonstrates a clear trend of softer-when-brighter. The X-ray spectra of 1H 0323+342, PMN J0948+0022, RGB J1644+263, PKS 1502+036, and J1246+0238 are well fitted by a power-law + blackbody model, suggesting a bright disk along with a jet, and J1222+0413 is fitted by broken power-law, while the remaining sources are well fitted by a power-law model revealing the non-thermal domination. The X-ray luminosity exhibits a strong correlation with $\gamma$-ray and disk luminosity, and a strong correlation with the jet power, suggesting a close coupling of disk and jet. Additionally, we have found an anti-correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the X-ray luminosity, as well as with the FWHM of H$\beta$ line, indicating a complex interaction between the central engine, jet activity, and the accretion disk in these sources.</description>

      <title>Leptonic and Hadronic Models of High-energy Nebula Around V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prominent, 200-pc-scale high-energy nebula surrounding the microquasar V4641~Sgr is the brightest known gamma-ray source in the Southern sky at $E &gt; 100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. In this paper, we develop self-consistent leptonic, hadronic, and leptohadronic models that reproduce both the observed spectrum and morphology of the source. Purely leptonic models are energetically more favorable yet they require rather specific morphological assumptions. The gamma-ray morphology of the source can be better explained within a hadronic scenario based on the identification of cold gas structures spatially correlated with the observed gamma-ray emission. However, a purely hadronic model for the source emission requires a substantial energy reservoir in protons and fails to reproduce the extended X-ray emission recently detected by XRISM. We show that emission including a combination of leptonic and hadronic components can reproduce both the spectral and morphological properties of the source. We provide predictions for the X-ray and neutrino spectra of~the~nebula that can discriminate the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the overall source signal.</description>

      <title>Identification of radio and gamma-ray pulsars in X-rays using data from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the data from the all-sky survey in soft X-rays performed by the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory we identified known radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsars in the eastern half of the sky. As a result, new candidate counterparts were found for twelve pulsars of different ages and types at a $\gtrsim$ 3$\sigma$ confidence level. A comparable number had been previously identified in the western half of the sky. In total, this represents about 12\% of all known pulsars already detected in X-rays. For the new counterparts, we provide estimates of their X-ray fluxes, preliminary characteristics of their X-ray spectra, and brief descriptions of the pulsars' properties. In addition, in the eastern half of the sky eROSITA detected 55 pulsars previously identified in X-rays by other telescopes.</description>

      <title>Eccentric Binaries Accreting from Thin Disks: Orbital Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary disks crucially affect the orbital and electromagnetic properties of binary systems across the universe, from stars in our galactic neighborhood to supermassive black hole binaries formed as the result of tumultuous galactic mergers. Previous simulations have focused nearly exclusively on thick accretion disks, appropriate for studying stellar binaries, and have found encouraging agreement with observations thereof. We present herein the first systematic study of eccentric binary systems accreting from thin disks, focusing on binary orbital evolution. Our main results are that (1) thinner disk not only drive binaries to rapidly inspiral, but also excite binary eccentricities at much higher rates; (2) while thick disks may drive binaries to a stable fixed point of $e\approx0.425$, thinner disks pump binary eccentricities to $e\gtrsim0.6$; (3) the range of near-zero eccentricities that are damped towards zero depends on both disk thickness and viscosity, thinner disks and those with $\alpha$ viscosities driving binaries towards circularity over a much narrower range of eccentricities. These differences follow largely from the effects of pressure support on accretion streams and shocks within the inner regions of the accretion flow. Our results suggest that accreting binary black holes should have high eccentricities well into the frequency range probed by pulsar timing arrays and space-based gravitational wave interferometers, affecting the spectrum and isotropy of the gravitational wave background. Our results also suggest that circumbinary disks may play an important role in shaping the orbits of close binary stars, but much less so those of wider binaries.</description>

      <title>The automation of optical transient discovery and classification in Rubin-era time-domain astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, capture dozens of transients each night. The workflows for discovering and classifying transients in survey data streams have become increasingly automated over decades of development. The recent integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools has produced major milestones, including the fully automated end-to-end discovery and classification of an optical transient, and has enabled automated rapid-response space-based follow-up. The now-operational Vera C. Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time are accelerating the rate of transient discovery and producing large volumes of data at incredible rates. Given the expected order-of-magnitude increase in transient discoveries, one promising path forwards for optical time-domain astronomy is heavily investing in accelerating the automation of our workflows. Here we review the current paradigm of real-time transient workflows, project their evolution during the Rubin era and present recommendations for accelerating transient astronomy with automation.</description>

      <title>Born-Infeld signatures in AdS black hole thermodynamics and gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of Einstein-Born-Infeld-Anti-de Sitter (EBI-AdS) black holes (BHs). Our study derives the Hawking temperature using standard surface gravity methods and examines quantum corrections through both the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and exponential entropy modifications, showing enhanced thermal radiation and potential remnant formation scenarios. The gravitational redshift analysis separates contributions from mass, cosmological constant, electromagnetic charge, and Born-Infeld (BI) corrections, with the latter scaling as $a^4/r^6$ and thus confined to near-horizon regimes. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate light deflection angles in both vacuum and plasma environments, demonstrating how dispersive media can either enhance or suppress nonlinear electrodynamic signatures depending on observational configurations. The thermodynamic analysis in extended phase space, where the BH mass corresponds to enthalpy, reveals phase structures with heat capacity transitions between positive and negative values, indicating regions of local stability and instability sensitive to parameter choices. We study BH heat engines operating in rectangular thermodynamic cycles, achieving efficiencies of $\eta \sim 0.11$--$0.21$ that reach 30--61\% of the corresponding Carnot limits, consistent with other AdS BH systems. Comparison with Johnson's analysis confirms that BI corrections to heat engine efficiency are of order $10^{-12}$ for typical parameter ranges, though these effects become appreciable in the strong-field regime where $r_h \lesssim 1.5$ in Planck units. The plasma deflection analysis reveals frequency-dependent refractive modifications encoded in the plasma parameter, offering additional possible observational channels.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic characterisation of millihertz gravitational-wave sources in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millihertz band is densely populated by continuous gravitational-wave signals from Galactic compact binaries, dominated by double white dwarfs (DWDs; binaries of two white dwarfs) with contributions from systems containing neutron stars and black holes (Amaro-Seoane et al. 2023). As these binaries inspiral due to gravitational-wave radiation, they can reach contact and begin mass transfer in the millihertz band. Gravitational-wave detectors like LISA will survey such compact binaries across the Milky Way, yielding samples numbering in the tens of thousands, with essentially complete sensitivity to orbital periods shorter than ~10-20 min (e.g. Lamberts et al. 2019). Assessing the nature of the binary components - and deriving masses, temperatures and compositions - requires systematic electromagnetic characterisation that breaks gravitational-wave degeneracies and enables full atmospheric and orbital solutions. At present, no dedicated facility or coordinated survey is planned to deliver electromagnetic follow-up at the scale necessary to maximise the science return of the millihertz gravitational-wave data; this white paper discusses the need and requirements of such a capability.</description>

      <title>The macroscopic precession model: describing quasi-periodic oscillations including internal structures of test bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic precession model (RPM) is widely-considered as a benchmark framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), albeit several observational inconsistencies suggest that the model remains incomplete. The RPM ensures \emph{structureless test particles} and attributes precession to geodesic motion alone. Here, we refine the RPM by incorporating the internal structure of rotating test bodies, while preserving the test particle approximation (TPA), and propose a \emph{macroscopic precession model} (MPM) by means of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, applied to a Schwarzschild background, which introduces 1) a shift in the Keplerian frequency and 2) an \emph{effective spin correction} to the radial epicyclic frequency that, once the spin tensor is modeled, reproduces a quasi-Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) correction. We apply the MPM to eight neutron star low mass X-ray binaries (NS-LMXBs), performing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits to twin kHz QPOs and find observational and statistical evidence in favor of precise power law spin reconstructions. Further, our model accurately predicts the $3:2$ frequency clustering, the disk boundaries and the NS masses. From the MPM model, we thus conclude that complexity of QPOs can be fully-described including the test particle internal structure.</description>

      <title>Transients as Determinants of Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar magnetic activity, manifested through spots (faculae and flares), fundamentally shapes the exoplanets' environments. For low-mass stars in particular, where most habitable-zone planets reside, the variable magnetic phenomena can dominate atmospheric chemistry, surface radiation levels, long-term atmospheric escape, and ultimately habitability. However, physical characteristics of these transients (e.g. energy and temperature) and their spectra remain ill-constrained due to limitations in cadence and magnitude access of current spectroscopic facilities. A next-generation 12-m class ground-based observatory equipped with integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at R$\sim$4,000 and $\sim$40,000 offers a transformational opportunity to characterize stellar activity in the time domain across large samples of exoplanet host stars. Such a facility would enable simultaneous monitoring of continuum variability, chromospheric and coronal line diagnostics, and particle-accelerated flare signatures, resolving the physics driving space weather and quantifying its impact on planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a solitary Alfv\'en wave model that exhibits nontrivial three-dimensional twisting of open magnetic field lines while preserving constant $|B|$. Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>HEL1OS -- A Hard X-ray Spectrometer on Board Aditya-L1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HEL1OS (High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer) is one of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 mission designed to continuously monitor and measure the time-resolved spectra of solar flares between 8 keV and 150 keV. This broad energy range has been covered by using compound semiconductor detectors: cadmium telluride (CdTe: 8 - 70 keV) and cadmium zinc telluride (CZT: 20 - 150 keV) with geometric areas of 0.5 cm$^2$ and 32 cm$^2$, respectively. A stainless steel collimator provides a field-of-view of 6$^\circ$ $\times$ 6$^\circ$ optimized to limit the off-axis response while keeping the design within the instrument mass constraints. The in-house designed low-noise digital pulse processing-based front-end electronics has achieved a spectral resolution of $\approx$ 1 keV at 14 keV (CdTe) and $\approx$ 7 keV at 60 keV (CZT). The instrument is also equipped with processing and power electronics to process the signal, drive the electronics, bias the detectors with required low and high voltages for optimal performance of the overall system. In this article, we present design aspects of the instrument, results from the pre-launch ground-based tests, and the in-orbit operations, which have indicated optimal performance in line with that expected.</description>

      <title>Evolution Models of CO WD -- AGB Star Merger Remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common envelope evolution is a critical but still poorly understood phase in binary evolution. It plays a key role in forming close binaries such as hot subdwarfs, double white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and double neutron stars. However, its outcomes remain highly uncertain. Depending on the efficiency of envelope ejection, a system may either survive as a close binary or undergo a complete merger. In this work, we investigate the post merger evolution of systems where a CO WD mergers with the core of an AGB star. A grid of merger remnant models with various core and envelope masses is constructed. At the onset of evolution, the CO core contracts and undergoes off-center carbon ignition, producing an inwardly propagating carbon flame. For remnants with relatively low mass of CO core, the flame phase is followed by core contraction and subsequent H-shell burning. For more massive CO cores, the carbon flame reaches the center and is soon followed by off-center neon burning, which is expected to eventually lead to core-collapse supernovae. The merger remnants occupy nearly the same region on HR diagram as ordinary AGB or super-AGB stars, exhibiting similar surface properties. Although their surface abundance may differ slightly from those of normal AGB stars depending on the initial core and envelope masses, these differences are strongly reduced once mass-loss is taken into account. We suggest that some giant-like stars, including candidates for Thorne-Zytkow objects (e.g., HV 2112), might alternatively be explained as AGB-WD merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Measuring Black Hole Masses using TDEs with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) provide an opportunity to study supermassive black holes that are otherwise quiescent. The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will be capable of discovering thousands of TDEs each year, allowing for a dramatic increase in the number of discovered TDEs. The optical light curves from TDEs can be used to model the physical parameters of the black hole and disrupted star, but the sampling and photometric uncertainty of the real data will couple with model degeneracies to limit our ability to recover these parameters. In this work, we aim to model the impact of the Rubin survey strategy on simulated TDE light curves to quantify the typical errors in the recovered parameters. Black hole masses $5.5&lt; \log M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot &lt; 8.2$ can be recovered with typical errors of 0.26 dex, with early coverage removing large outliers. Recovery of the mass of the disrupted star is difficult, limited by the degeneracy with the accretion efficiency. Only 57\% of the cases have accurate recovery of whether the events are full or partial, so we caution the use this method to assess whether TDEs are partially or fully disrupted systems. Black hole mass measurements obtained from Rubin observations of TDEs will provide powerful constraints on the black hole mass function, black hole -- galaxy co-evolution, and the population of black hole spins, though continued work to understand the origin of TDE observables and how the TDE rate varies among galaxies will be necessarily to fully utilize the upcoming rich data set from Rubin.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation black hole mass and distance estimates of Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona, which we approximate as a point-like 'lamppost' source. Our best fitting model returns a mass of $M=15\pm 4 ~M_\odot$ and a distance of $D=3.4_{-1.2}^{+1.6}$ kpc (90 per cent uncertainties), which are consistent with the most recent dynamical and parallax measurements respectively.</description>

      <title>Misalignment of the Lense-Thirring precession by an accretion torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbiting matter misaligned with a spinning black hole undergoes Lense-Thirring precession, due to the frame-dragging effect. This phenomenon is particularly relevant for type-C QPOs observed in the hard states of low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the accretion flow in these hard states is complex, consisting of a geometrically thick, hot corona surrounded by a geometrically thin, cold disk. Recent simulations have demonstrated that, in such a truncated disk scenario, the precession of the inner hot corona slows due to its interaction with the outer cold disk. This paper aims to provide an analytical description of the precession of an inner (hot) torus in the presence of accretion torques exerted by the outer (cold) disk. Using the angular momentum conservation equation, we investigate the evolution of the torus angular momentum vector for various models of accretion torque. We find that, in general, an accretion torque tilts the axis of precession away from the black hole spin axis. In all models, if the accretion torque is sufficiently strong, it can halt the precession; any perturbation from this stalled state will cause the torus to precess around an axis that is misaligned with the black hole spin axis. The accretion torque exerted by the outer thin disk can cause precession around an axis that is neither aligned with the black hole spin axis nor perpendicular to the plane of the disk. This finding may have significant observational implications, as the jet direction, if aligned with the angular momentum axis of the torus, may no longer reliably indicate the black hole spin axis or the orientation of the outer accretion disk</description>

      <title>Exploring Hard X-ray Properties of $\gamma$-ray Emitting Narrow Line Seyfert-I Galaxies through NuSTAR Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the six gamma-ray-detected Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies using the hard X-ray observations from Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and optical g- \&amp; r-band from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The X-ray spectra corresponding to all objects are well-fitted with a power-law spectral model, and a strong "redder-when-brighter" trend is seen, which is mostly seen in Blazars. The X-ray light curves were produced for all the available observations, and the F$_{var}$ is estimated. In 1H 0323+342, we found that F$_{var}$ lies between 9$\%$ to 22$\%$, suggesting significant variability in the source. Similarly, for PKS 2004-447, we found F$_{var}$ lies between 10$\%$ to 21$\%$. We see a strong X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectral index correlation among these objects, suggesting that these are produced through a similar process. Comparing the X-ray spectral index with other class objects, we see that NLSy1 galaxies are similar to LBL and IBL types. We see a negative trend of X-ray flux with the $\gamma$-ray luminosity in these objects, suggesting an anti-correlation between them. A similar trend is seen between the X-ray flux, total jet power, and disk luminosity. The X-ray spectral index also shows a negative trend with total jet power and disk luminosity. The optical variability amplitude (in magnitude) lies between 0.90 to 2.32, and the fractional variability varies from 13\% to 40\%. The color-magnitude plot shows mostly the redder-when-brighter (RWB) trend, suggesting $\gamma$-NLSy1 are much closer to FSRQs than BL Lacs. Our results, overall, summarize how the various parameters in gamma-ray-detected NLSy1 are connected.</description>

      <title>Spins of Black Holes in X-ray Binaries and the Tension with the Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>

Abstract: We review current challenges in understanding the values and origin of the spins of black holes in binaries. Thanks to recent advances in astrophysical instrumentation, the spins can now be measured using both gravitational waves emitted by merging black holes and electromagnetic radiation from accreting X-ray binaries containing black holes. A key finding of the gravitational-wave observatories is that premerger black holes in binaries have low spin values, with an average dimensionless spin parameter of $a_*\sim$0.1--0.2, with 90\% having $a_*\lesssim 0.6$. This implies that the natal spins of black holes are generally low, and the angular momentum transport in massive stars is efficient. On the other hand, most of the published spins in X-ray binaries are very high. In particular, this is the case for binaries with high-mass donors (potential progenitors of mergers), where their published spins range from 0.8 to 1.0. At the same time, their short lifetimes prevent significant spin-up by accretion. Those with low-mass donors could be spun-up to $a_*\gtrsim 0.7$ by accretion only if the donor initial masses were more than several solar masses, which remains unproven. However, the existing methods of spin measurements suffer from significant systematic errors. The method relying on relativistic X-ray line broadening is based on the separation of the observed spectra into incident and reflected ones, which is highly uncertain. The method relying on spectral fitting of accretion disk continua uses models that predict the disk to be highly unstable, while stability is observed. Improved stable models predict lower spins. The published spin measurements in X-ray binaries are uncertain. The spins of the binaries with high-mass donors may be low, while those with low-mass donors have a broader spin distribution, ranging from low to high.</description>

      <title>Photospheric emission from GRB 211211A altered by a strong radiation-mediated shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectra are typically non-thermal, with many including two spectral breaks suggestive of optically-thin emission. However, the emitted spectrum from a GRB photosphere, which includes prior dissipation of energy by radiation-mediated shocks (RMSs), can also produce such spectral features. Here, we analyze the bright GRB 211211A using the Kompaneets RMS Approximation (KRA). We find that the KRA can fit the time-resolved spectra well, significantly better than the traditionally used Band function in all studied time bins. The analysis of GRB 211211A reveals a jet with a typical Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim 300$), and a strong RMS (upstream dimensionless specific momentum, $\gamma_u \beta_u \sim 3$) occurring at a moderate optical depth ($\tau \sim 35$) in a relatively cold upstream ($\theta_u = k_{\rm B} T_u / m_e c^2 \sim 10^{-4}$). We conclude that broad GRB spectra that exhibit two breaks can also be well explained by photospheric emission. This implies that, {in such cases}, the spectral shape in the MeV-band alone is not enough to determine the emission mechanism during the prompt phase in GRBs.</description>

      <title>A thermonuclear supernova interacting with hydrogen- and helium-deficient circumstellar material. SN 2020aeuh as a SN Ia-CSM-C/O?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae; SNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of SNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for studies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours single-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly connected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events, and the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion progenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed interaction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the evolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe Ia and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh resembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated spectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN 2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and helium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon and oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction mode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a Type Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was deficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute our best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN 2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical simulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical evolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around SN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar evolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.</description>

      <title>A Necessary Condition for the Submergence of Proto-Neutron Star Magnetic Fields by Supernova Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Central compact objects (CCOs) are a subclass of neutron stars with a dipole magnetic field strength considerably weaker than those of radio pulsars and magnetars. One possible explanation for such weak magnetic fields in the CCOs is the hidden magnetic field scenario, in which supernova fallback submerges the magnetosphere of a proto-neutron star beneath a newly formed crust. However, the fallback mass and timescale required for this submergence process remain uncertain. We perform one-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the supernova fallback onto a magnetized proto-neutron star, while considering neutrino cooling. In our simulations, the infalling material compresses the magnetic field and drives a strong shock. The shock initially expands outward, but eventually stalls and recedes as neutrino cooling becomes significant. After the shock stalls, the gas density above the magnetosphere increases rapidly, potentially leading to the formation of a new crust. To understand the shock dynamics, we develop semi-analytic models that describe the resulting magnetospheric and shock radii when the shock stalls. By comparing the fallback time scale with the shock stalling time scale, corresponding to the waiting time for the new crust formation, we derive a necessary condition for the submergence of the PNS magnetic field. Our results will provide guidance for investigating the diversity of young isolated neutron stars through multidimensional simulations.</description>

      <title>MUSE IFU observations of galaxies hosting Tidal Disruption Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z&lt;0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z&lt;0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and &gt;45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</description>

      <title>Examining the Gap in the Chirp Mass Distribution of Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\odot$. In this article, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.</description>

      <title>Accretion is All You Need: Black Hole Spin Alignment in Merger GW231123 Indicates Accretion Pathway</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW231123 represents the most massive binary-black-hole merger detected to date, lying firmly within, or even above, the pair-instability mass gap. The component spins are both exceptionally high ($a_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$, $a_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$), which is difficult to explain with repeated mergers. Here we show that the black hole spin vectors are closely aligned with each other while significantly tilted relative to the binary's orbital angular momentum, pointing to a common accretion-driven origin. We examine astrophysical formation channels capable of producing near-equal, high-mass, and mutually aligned spins consistent with GW231123 -- particularly binaries embedded in AGN disks and Pop~III remnants, which grew via coherent misaligned gas accretion. We further argue that other high-mass, high-spin events, e.g., GW190521 may share a similar evolutionary pathway. These findings underscore the critical role of sustained, coherent accretion in shaping the most extreme black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-Powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-Wave Emission and High-Energy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description>

      <title>Interaction between disk and extended corona in a general relativistic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)</description>

      <title>On Atomic Line Opacities for Modeling Astrophysical Radiative Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In astrophysics, atomic transition line opacity is a primary source of uncertainty in theoretical calculations of radiative transfer. Much of this uncertainty is dominated by the inability to resolve the lines in frequency, leading to the use of approximate frequency-averaged treatments, often employing the `line-expansion formalism'. In this short paper we assess the usage of this formalism in simulations, specifically the prominent Eastman \&amp; Pinto 1993 formula (hereafter EP93). As a case study, we reproduce EP93 opacities from the commonly-used STELLA simulations. The latter previously yielded orders of magnitude discrepancy in observed emission relative to similar simulations from our group. The discrepancy is due to differences in line opacity treatment. We show that the widely used EP93 expansion opacity substantially underestimates photon emissivity and reprocessing rates, even when it correctly captures photon mean-free-paths. We also highlight the importance of introducing micro-plasma electron excitation level cutoffs in the equation of state (EOS) for calculating opacity.
  We propose a new method for calculating emissivity, based on a modification of the simple frequency-bin averaged opacity method, in a way that incorporates the effect of expansion on effective line strength. This formulation should reduce the overestimation of the opacity that may occur with the simple averaging method. To our knowledge, no fully-consistent coarse-frequency solution currently exists for line modeling in these systems.
  Finally, we describe new features in our updated publicly available high-resolution frequency-dependent opacity table.</description>

Abstract: NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling (PPM), providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</title>

Abstract: A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>Searching for quantum-gravity footprint around stellar-mass black holes</title>

Abstract: According to the asymptotically safe gravity, black holes may have characteristics different from those described according to general relativity if the running of the gravitational constant coupling happens at low energies. Particularly, they should be more compact, with a smaller event horizon, which in turn affects the other quantities dependent on it, like the photon ring and the size of the innermost stable circular orbit. We decided to test the latter hypothesis by searching in the literature for observational measurements of the inner radius of the accretion disk around stellar-mass black holes. We selected the smallest values measured when the disk was in high/soft state, made them homogeneous by taking into account the most recent and more reliable values of mass, spin, viewing angle, and distance from the Earth, and compared with the expectations of the Kerr metric. We do not find any significant deviation. Some doubtful cases can be easily understood as due to specific states of the object during the observation or instrumental biases. We set the tightest constraint on the parameter $\xi$ obtained to date.</description>

      <title>Two Decades of Dust Evolution in SN 2005af through JWST, Spitzer, and Chemical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of dust in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), in general, is poorly constrained owing to a lack of infrared observations after a few years from explosion. Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN 1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled us to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN 2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution in SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space Telescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model of dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN 2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately quantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the explosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We report that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust formed in the ejecta, with a total mass of at least 0.02 Msun. In the circumstellar medium, the surviving oxygen-rich dust amounts to about 0.003-0.006 Msun, yielding a total dust mass of at least 0.025 Msun.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of accretion disk geometry in shaping black hole shadows</title>

Abstract: We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness (characterized by the half-opening angle $\psi_0$) broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.</description>

      <title>A carbon-rich atmosphere on a windy pulsar planet</title>

Abstract: A handful of enigmatic Jupiter-mass objects have been discovered orbiting pulsars. One such object, PSR\,J2322-2650b, uniquely resembles a hot Jupiter exoplanet due to its minimum density of 1.8 g/cm^3 and its ~1900 K equilibrium temperature. We use JWST to observe PSR J2322-2650b's emission spectrum across an entire orbit. In stark contrast to every known exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star, we find an atmosphere rich in molecular carbon (C3, C2) with strong westward winds. Our observations open up new exoplanetary chemical (ultra-high C/O and C/N ratios of &gt;100 and &gt;10,000, respectively) and dynamical regimes (ultra-fast rotation with external irradiation) to observational study. The extreme carbon enrichment poses a severe challenge to the current understanding of ``black widow'' companions, which were expected to consist of a wider range of elements due to their origins as stripped stellar cores.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. (2025), I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $k^{-17/20}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criteria for this process, revealing that young SNR with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. (2025), this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of Super-Kamiokande with Gadolinium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-Kamiokande [SK] was upgraded through the addition of gadolinium sulfate to its ultrapure water, initiating the SK-Gd program. This development enables efficient neutron tagging via the large capture cross section of gadolinium, greatly improving the identification of inverse beta decay events, the primary channel for detecting the diffuse supernova neutrino background [DSNB]. The upgrade also enhances sensitivity to galactic and pre-supernova neutrinos, as well as atmospheric neutrino interactions. To realize this capability, extensive work was performed, including the construction and operation of the EGADS demonstrator, the refurbishment of the SK tank, the development of radiopure gadolinium production methods, and the validation of the loading and uniformity of gadolinium in solution. Early SK-Gd operation has demonstrated high neutron-tagging efficiency, reduced backgrounds, and world-leading limits on the DSNB flux. With these advances, SK-Gd now stands at the threshold of discovering the DSNB and opens a wide range of new opportunities in astrophysics and neutrino physics.</description>
