      <title>Nonparametric Sparse Online Learning of the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. Data-driven techniques to learn the Koopman operator typically assume that the chosen function space is closed under system dynamics. In this paper, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and explore the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen function space. We relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator and then present an operator stochastic approximation algorithm to learn the Koopman operator iteratively with control over the complexity of the representation. We provide both asymptotic and finite-time last-iterate guarantees of the online sparse learning algorithm with trajectory-based sampling with an analysis that is substantially more involved than that for finite-dimensional stochastic approximation. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Variational Schr\"odinger Momentum Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum Schr\"odinger Bridge (mSB) has emerged as a leading method for accelerating generative diffusion processes and reducing transport costs. However, the lack of simulation-free properties inevitably results in high training costs and affects scalability. To obtain a trade-off between transport properties and scalability, we introduce variational Schr\"odinger momentum diffusion (VSMD), which employs linearized forward score functions (variational scores) to eliminate the dependence on simulated forward trajectories. Our approach leverages a multivariate diffusion process with adaptively transport-optimized variational scores. Additionally, we apply a critical-damping transform to stabilize training by removing the need for score estimations for both velocity and samples. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of samples generated with optimal variational scores and momentum diffusion. Empirical results demonstrate that VSMD efficiently generates anisotropic shapes while maintaining transport efficacy, outperforming overdamped alternatives, and avoiding complex denoising processes. Our approach also scales effectively to real-world data, achieving competitive results in time series and image generation.</description>

      <title>Towards the Generalization of Multi-view Learning: An Information-theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiview learning has drawn widespread attention for its efficacy in leveraging cross-view consensus and complementarity information to achieve a comprehensive representation of data. While multi-view learning has undergone vigorous development and achieved remarkable success, the theoretical understanding of its generalization behavior remains elusive. This paper aims to bridge this gap by developing information-theoretic generalization bounds for multi-view learning, with a particular focus on multi-view reconstruction and classification tasks. Our bounds underscore the importance of capturing both consensus and complementary information from multiple different views to achieve maximally disentangled representations. These results also indicate that applying the multi-view information bottleneck regularizer is beneficial for satisfactory generalization performance. Additionally, we derive novel data-dependent bounds under both leave-one-out and supersample settings, yielding computational tractable and tighter bounds. In the interpolating regime, we further establish the fast-rate bound for multi-view learning, exhibiting a faster convergence rate compared to conventional square-root bounds. Numerical results indicate a strong correlation between the true generalization gap and the derived bounds across various learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exponential Family Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-attention mechanism is the backbone of the transformer neural network underlying most large language models. It can capture complex word patterns and long-range dependencies in natural language. This paper introduces exponential family attention (EFA), a probabilistic generative model that extends self-attention to handle high-dimensional sequence, spatial, or spatial-temporal data of mixed data types, including both discrete and continuous observations. The key idea of EFA is to model each observation conditional on all other existing observations, called the context, whose relevance is learned in a data-driven way via an attention-based latent factor model. In particular, unlike static latent embeddings, EFA uses the self-attention mechanism to capture dynamic interactions in the context, where the relevance of each context observations depends on other observations. We establish an identifiability result and provide a generalization guarantee on excess loss for EFA. Across real-world and synthetic data sets -- including U.S. city temperatures, Instacart shopping baskets, and MovieLens ratings -- we find that EFA consistently outperforms existing models in capturing complex latent structures and reconstructing held-out data.</description>

      <title>Marginal and Conditional Importance Measures from Machine Learning Models and Their Relationship with Conditional Average Treatment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16988v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting black-box machine learning models is challenging due to their strong dependence on data and inherently non-parametric nature. This paper reintroduces the concept of importance through "Marginal Variable Importance Metric" (MVIM), a model-agnostic measure of predictor importance based on the true conditional expectation function. MVIM evaluates predictors' influence on continuous or discrete outcomes. A permutation-based estimation approach, inspired by \citet{breiman2001random} and \citet{fisher2019all}, is proposed to estimate MVIM. MVIM estimator is biased when predictors are highly correlated, as black-box models struggle to extrapolate in low-probability regions. To address this, we investigated the bias-variance decomposition of MVIM to understand the source and pattern of the bias under high correlation. A Conditional Variable Importance Metric (CVIM), adapted from \citet{strobl2008conditional}, is introduced to reduce this bias. Both MVIM and CVIM exhibit a quadratic relationship with the conditional average treatment effect (CATE).</description>

      <title>Copyright and Competition: Estimating Supply and Demand with Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Copyright policies play a pivotal role in protecting the intellectual property of creators and companies in creative industries. The advent of cost-reducing technologies, such as generative AI, in these industries calls for renewed attention to the role of these policies. This paper studies product positioning and competition in a market of creatively differentiated products and the competitive and welfare effects of copyright protection. A common feature of products with creative elements is that their key attributes (e.g., images and text) are unstructured and thus high-dimensional. We focus on a stylized design product, fonts, and use data from the world's largest online marketplace for fonts. We use neural network embeddings to quantify unstructured attributes and measure the visual similarity. We show that this measure closely aligns with actual human perception. Based on this measure, we empirically find that competitions occur locally in the visual characteristics space. We then develop a structural model for supply and demand that integrate the embeddings. Through counterfactual analyses, we find that local copyright protection can enhance consumer welfare when products are relocated, and the interplay between copyright and cost-reducing technologies is essential in determining an optimal policy for social welfare. We believe that the embedding analysis and empirical models introduced in this paper can be applicable to a range of industries where unstructured data captures essential features of products and markets.</description>

      <title>Improving Network Threat Detection by Knowledge Graph, Large Language Model, and Imbalanced Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network threat detection has been challenging due to the complexities of attack activities and the limitation of historical threat data to learn from. To help enhance the existing practices of using analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods to detect the network threats, we propose an integrated modelling framework, where Knowledge Graph is used to analyze the users' activity patterns, Imbalanced Learning techniques are used to prune and weigh Knowledge Graph, and LLM is used to retrieve and interpret the users' activities from Knowledge Graph. The proposed framework is applied to Agile Threat Detection through Online Sequential Learning. The preliminary results show the improved threat capture rate by 3%-4% and the increased interpretabilities of risk predictions based on the users' activities.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Feedback-Free Learning with Forward Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for backpropagation-free learning employ local error feedback to direct iterative optimisation via gradient descent. In this study, we examine the more restrictive setting where retrograde communication from neuronal outputs is unavailable for pre-synaptic weight optimisation. To address this challenge, we propose Forward Projection (FP). This novel randomised closed-form training method requires only a single forward pass over the entire dataset for model fitting, without retrograde communication. Target values for pre-activation membrane potentials are generated layer-wise via nonlinear projections of pre-synaptic inputs and the labels. Local loss functions are optimised over pre-synaptic inputs using closed-form regression, without feedback from neuronal outputs or downstream layers. Interpretability is a key advantage of FP training; membrane potentials of hidden neurons in FP-trained networks encode information which is interpretable layer-wise as label predictions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FP across four biomedical datasets. In few-shot learning tasks, FP yielded more generalisable models than those optimised via backpropagation. In large-sample tasks, FP-based models achieve generalisation comparable to gradient descent-based local learning methods while requiring only a single forward propagation step, achieving significant speed up for training. Interpretation functions defined on local neuronal activity in FP-based models successfully identified clinically salient features for diagnosis in two biomedical datasets. Forward Projection is a computationally efficient machine learning approach that yields interpretable neural network models without retrograde communication of neuronal activity during training.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Embeddings for Robust Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) is a crucial aspect of realizing trustworthy AI systems. Although alignment methods aim to suppress harmful content generation, LLMs are often still vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that employ adversarial inputs that subvert alignment and induce harmful outputs. We propose the Randomized Embedding Smoothing and Token Aggregation (RESTA) defense, which adds random noise to the embedding vectors and performs aggregation during the generation of each output token, with the aim of better preserving semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior robustness versus utility tradeoffs compared to the baseline defenses.</description>

      <title>On characterizing optimal learning trajectories in a class of learning problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this brief paper, we provide a mathematical framework that exploits the relationship between the maximum principle and dynamic programming for characterizing optimal learning trajectories in a class of learning problem, which is related to point estimations for modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear functions. Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset. Moreover, using a successive Galerkin approximation method, we provide an algorithmic recipe how to construct the corresponding optimal learning trajectories leading to the optimal estimated model parameters for such a class of learning problem.</description>

      <title>Ancestral Inference and Learning for Branching Processes in Random Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ancestral inference for branching processes in random environments involves determining the ancestor distribution parameters using the population sizes of descendant generations. In this paper, we introduce a new methodology for ancestral inference utilizing the generalized method of moments. We demonstrate that the estimator's behavior is critically influenced by the coefficient of variation of the environment sequence. Furthermore, despite the process's evolution being heavily dependent on the offspring means of various generations, we show that the joint limiting distribution of the ancestor and offspring estimators of the mean, under appropriate centering and scaling, decouple and converge to independent Gaussian random variables when the ratio of the number of generations to the logarithm of the number of replicates converges to zero. Additionally, we provide estimators for the limiting variance and illustrate our findings through numerical experiments and data from Polymerase Chain Reaction experiments and COVID-19 data.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Mean-Variance Portfolio Optimization with Regime-Switching Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering the continuous-time Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio optimization problem, we study a regime-switching market setting and apply reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to assist informed exploration within the control space. We introduce and solve the Exploratory Mean Variance with Regime Switching (EMVRS) problem. We also present a Policy Improvement Theorem. Further, we recognize that the widely applied Temporal Difference (TD) learning is not adequate for the EMVRS context, hence we consider Orthogonality Condition (OC) learning, leveraging the martingale property of the induced optimal value function from the analytical solution to EMVRS. We design a RL algorithm that has more meaningful parameterization using the market parameters and propose an updating scheme for each parameter. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of OC learning over TD learning with a clear convergence of the market parameters towards their corresponding ``grounding true" values in a simulated market scenario. In a real market data study, EMVRS with OC learning outperforms its counterparts with the highest mean and reasonably low volatility of the annualized portfolio returns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference for stochastic processes has advanced significantly due to applications in diverse fields, but challenges remain in high-dimensional settings where parameters are allowed to grow with the sample size. This paper analyzes a d-dimensional ergodic diffusion process under sparsity constraints, focusing on the adaptive Lasso estimator, which improves variable selection and bias over the standard Lasso. We derive conditions under which the adaptive Lasso achieves support recovery property and asymptotic normality for the drift parameter, with a focus on linear models. Explicit parameter relationships guide tuning for optimal performance, and a marginal estimator is proposed for p&gt;&gt;d scenarios under partial orthogonality assumption. Numerical studies confirm the adaptive Lasso's superiority over standard Lasso and MLE in accuracy and support recovery, providing robust solutions for high-dimensional stochastic processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of tree-based models, P-Trees, for analyzing (unbalanced) panel of individual asset returns, generalizing high-dimensional sorting with economic guidance and interpretability. Under the mean-variance efficient framework, P-Trees construct test assets that significantly advance the efficient frontier compared to commonly used test assets, with alphas unexplained by benchmark pricing models. P-Tree tangency portfolios also constitute traded factors, recovering the pricing kernel and outperforming popular observable and latent factor models for investments and cross-sectional pricing. Finally, P-Trees capture the complexity of asset returns with sparsity, achieving out-of-sample Sharpe ratios close to those attained only by over-parameterized large models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of mean estimation in the heteroscedastic setting. In particular, we consider symmetric random variables having the same location parameter and different and unknown scale parameters. Our goal is then to estimate their unknown common location parameter. It is an elementary topic but yet a not very well-studied one since we always make the assumption that the random variables are independent and identically distributed. In this paper, we study the median estimator and we establish upper and lower bounds on its estimation error that are of the same order and that generalize and improve recent results of Devroye et al. and Xia.</description>

      <title>Hellinger-Kantorovich Gradient Flows: Global Exponential Decay of Entropy Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of gradient flows of positive and probability measures, focusing on the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, which unifies transport mechanism of Otto-Wasserstein, and the birth-death mechanism of Hellinger (or Fisher-Rao). A central contribution is a complete characterization of global exponential decay behaviors of entropy functionals (e.g. KL, $\chi^2$) under Otto-Wasserstein and Hellinger-type gradient flows. In particular, for the more challenging analysis of HK gradient flows on positive measures -- where the typical log-Sobolev arguments fail -- we develop a specialized shape-mass decomposition that enables new analysis results. Our approach also leverages the (Polyak-)\L{}ojasiewicz-type functional inequalities and a careful extension of classical dissipation estimates. These findings provide a unified and complete theoretical framework for gradient flows and underpin applications in computational algorithms for statistical inference, optimization, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Sources of Uncertainty in Supervised Machine Learning -- A Statisticians' View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning and predictive models have achieved an impressive standard today, enabling us to answer questions that were inconceivable a few years ago. Besides these successes, it becomes clear, that beyond pure prediction, which is the primary strength of most supervised machine learning algorithms, the quantification of uncertainty is relevant and necessary as well. However, before quantification is possible, types and sources of uncertainty need to be defined precisely. While first concepts and ideas in this direction have emerged in recent years, this paper adopts a conceptual, basic science perspective and examines possible sources of uncertainty. By adopting the viewpoint of a statistician, we discuss the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which are more commonly associated with machine learning. The paper aims to formalize the two types of uncertainty and demonstrates that sources of uncertainty are miscellaneous and can not always be decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic. Drawing parallels between statistical concepts and uncertainty in machine learning, we emphasise the role of data and their influence on uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic limit in learning period three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A continuous one-dimensional map with period three includes all periods. This raises the following question: Can we obtain any types of periodic orbits solely by learning three data points? In this paper, we report the answer to be yes. Considering a random neural network in its thermodynamic limit, we first show that almost all learned periods are unstable and each network has its characteristic attractors (which can even be untrained ones). The latently acquired dynamics, which are unstable within the trained network, serve as a foundation for the diversity of characteristic attractors and may even lead to the emergence of attractors of all periods after learning. When the neural network interpolation is quadratic, a universal post-learning bifurcation scenario appears, which is consistent with a topological conjugacy between the trained network and the classical logistic map. In addition to universality, we explore specific properties of certain networks, including the singular behavior at the infinite scale of weights limit and the symmetry in learning period three.</description>

      <title>Predictive variational inference: Learn the predictively optimal posterior distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vanilla variational inference finds an optimal approximation to the Bayesian posterior distribution, but even the exact Bayesian posterior is often not meaningful under model misspecification. We propose predictive variational inference (PVI): a general inference framework that seeks and samples from an optimal posterior density such that the resulting posterior predictive distribution is as close to the true data generating process as possible, while this closeness is measured by multiple scoring rules. By optimizing the objective, the predictive variational inference is generally not the same as, or even attempting to approximate, the Bayesian posterior, even asymptotically. Rather, we interpret it as implicit hierarchical expansion. Further, the learned posterior uncertainty detects heterogeneity of parameters among the population, enabling automatic model diagnosis. This framework applies to both likelihood-exact and likelihood-free models. We demonstrate its application in real data examples.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Credal Regions for Classification with Ambiguous Ground Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open question in \emph{Imprecise Probabilistic Machine Learning} is how to empirically derive a credal region (i.e., a closed and convex family of probabilities on the output space) from the available data, without any prior knowledge or assumption. In classification problems, credal regions are a tool that is able to provide provable guarantees under realistic assumptions by characterizing the uncertainty about the distribution of the labels. Building on previous work, we show that credal regions can be directly constructed using conformal methods. This allows us to provide a novel extension of classical conformal prediction to problems with ambiguous ground truth, that is, when the exact labels for given inputs are not exactly known. The resulting construction enjoys desirable practical and theoretical properties: (i) conformal coverage guarantees, (ii) smaller prediction sets (compared to classical conformal prediction regions) and (iii) disentanglement of uncertainty sources (epistemic, aleatoric). We empirically verify our findings on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Robust Policy Search for Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.01000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex robot navigation and control problems can be framed as policy search problems. However, interactive learning in uncertain environments can be expensive, requiring the use of data-efficient methods. Bayesian optimization is an efficient nonlinear optimization method where queries are carefully selected to gather information about the optimum location. This is achieved by a surrogate model, which encodes past information, and the acquisition function for query selection. Bayesian optimization can be very sensitive to uncertainty in the input data or prior assumptions. In this work, we incorporate both robust optimization and statistical robustness, showing that both types of robustness are synergistic. For robust optimization we use an improved version of unscented Bayesian optimization which provides safe and repeatable policies in the presence of policy uncertainty. We also provide new theoretical insights. For statistical robustness, we use an adaptive surrogate model and we introduce the Boltzmann selection as a stochastic acquisition method to have convergence guarantees and improved performance even with surrogate modeling errors. We present results in several optimization benchmarks and robot tasks.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains where erroneous predictions may lead to potentially catastrophic consequences, highlighting the need for learning systems to be aware of how confident they are in their own predictions: in other words, 'to know when they do not know'. In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Neural Network (RS-NN) approach to classification which predicts belief functions (rather than classical probability vectors) over the class list using the mathematics of random sets, i.e., distributions over the collection of sets of classes. RS-NN encodes the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced by training sets that are insufficiently representative or limited in size via the size of the convex set of probability vectors associated with a predicted belief function. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian and Ensemble methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection on multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-10 vs SVHN/Intel-Image, MNIST vs FMNIST/KMNIST, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O). RS-NN also scales up effectively to large-scale architectures (e.g. WideResNet-28-10, VGG16, Inception V3, EfficientNetB2 and ViT-Base-16), exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and can provide statistical guarantees in a conformal learning setting.</description>

      <title>Fault detection in propulsion motors in the presence of concept drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and statistical methods can improve conventional motor protection systems, providing early warning and detection of emerging failures. Data-driven methods rely on historical data to learn how the system is expected to behave under normal circumstances. An unexpected change in the underlying system may cause a change in the statistical properties of the data, and by this alter the performance of the fault detection algorithm in terms of time to detection and false alarms. This kind of change, called \textit{concept drift}, requires adaptations to maintain constant performance. In this article, we present a machine learning approach for detecting overheating in the stator windings of marine electrical propulsion motors. Using simulated overheating faults injected into operational data, the methods are shown to provide early detection compared to conventional methods based on temperature readings and fixed limits. The proposed monitors are designed to operate for a type of concept drift observed in operational data collected from a specific class of motors in a fleet of ships. Using a mix of real and simulated concept drifts, it is shown that the proposed monitors are able to provide early detections during and after concept drifts, without the need for full model retraining.</description>

      <title>Learning to Mitigate Externalities: the Coase Theorem with Hindsight Rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In economic theory, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players that affects the social welfare. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To address this issue, we consider a two-player bandit setting where the actions of one of the players affect the other player and we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 1960]. This result shows that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enable transfers and bargaining between the players. Our work removes the classical assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights, the social welfare breaks down. We then design a policy for the players which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Multiple Importance Sampling for Stochastic Gradient Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical and practical framework for efficient importance sampling of mini-batch samples for gradient estimation from single and multiple probability distributions. To handle noisy gradients, our framework dynamically evolves the importance distribution during training by utilizing a self-adaptive metric. Our framework combines multiple, diverse sampling distributions, each tailored to specific parameter gradients. This approach facilitates the importance sampling of vector-valued gradient estimation. Rather than naively combining multiple distributions, our framework involves optimally weighting data contribution across multiple distributions. This adapted combination of multiple importance yields superior gradient estimates, leading to faster training convergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluations across a range of optimization tasks like classification and regression on both image and point cloud datasets.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Mini-Batch Quadratics for Applications in Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic approximations form a fundamental building block of machine learning methods. E.g., second-order optimizers try to find the Newton step into the minimum of a local quadratic proxy to the objective function; and the second-order approximation of a network's loss function can be used to quantify the uncertainty of its outputs via the Laplace approximation. When computations on the entire training set are intractable - typical for deep learning - the relevant quantities are computed on mini-batches. This, however, distorts and biases the shape of the associated stochastic quadratic approximations in an intricate way with detrimental effects on applications. In this paper, we (i) show that this bias introduces a systematic error, (ii) provide a theoretical explanation for it, (iii) explain its relevance for second-order optimization and uncertainty quantification via the Laplace approximation in deep learning, and (iv) develop and evaluate debiasing strategies.</description>

      <title>CantorNet: A Sandbox for Testing Geometrical and Topological Complexity Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of "Spontaneous" Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cognition can spontaneously shift conversation topics, often triggered by emotional or contextual signals. In contrast, self-attention-based language models depend on structured statistical cues from input tokens for next-token prediction, lacking this spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we investigate the factors that influence the next-token prediction to change the topic of the input sequence. We define concepts of topic continuity, ambiguous sequences, and change of topic, based on defining a topic as a set of token priority graphs (TPGs). Using a simplified single-layer self-attention architecture, we derive analytical characterizations of topic changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a topic change can occur only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, longer context lengths and overlapping topics reduce the likelihood of spontaneous redirection. These insights highlight differences between human cognition and self-attention-based models in navigating topic changes and underscore the challenges in designing conversational AI capable of handling "spontaneous" conversations more naturally. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has explored these questions with a focus as closely aligned to human conversation and thought.</description>

      <title>Interpretability in Parameter Space: Minimizing Mechanistic Description Length with Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the internal mechanisms learned by neural networks. Despite recent progress toward this goal, it remains unclear how best to decompose neural network parameters into mechanistic components. We introduce Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), a method that directly decomposes a neural network's parameters into components that (i) are faithful to the parameters of the original network, (ii) require a minimal number of components to process any input, and (iii) are maximally simple. Our approach thus optimizes for a minimal length description of the network's mechanisms. We demonstrate APD's effectiveness by successfully identifying ground truth mechanisms in multiple toy experimental settings: Recovering features from superposition; separating compressed computations; and identifying cross-layer distributed representations. While challenges remain to scaling APD to non-toy models, our results suggest solutions to several open problems in mechanistic interpretability, including identifying minimal circuits in superposition, offering a conceptual foundation for 'features', and providing an architecture-agnostic framework for neural network decomposition.</description>
