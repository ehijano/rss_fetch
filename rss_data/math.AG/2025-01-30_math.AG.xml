      <title>Non-smooth regular curves via a descent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to continue the classification of non-smooth regular curves, but over fields of characteristic three. These curves were originally introduced by Zariski as generic fibers of counterexamples to Bertini's theorem on the variation of singular points of linear series. Such a classification has been introduced by St\"ohr, taking advantage of the equivalent theory of non-conservative function fields, which in turn occurs only over non-perfect fields $K$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We propose here a different way of approach, relying on the fact that a non-smooth regular curve in $\mathbb{P}^n_K$ provides a singular curve when viewed inside $\mathbb{P}^n_{K^{1/p}}$. Hence we were naturally induced to the question of characterizing singular curves in $\mathbb{P}^n_{K^{1/p}}$ coming from regular curves in $\mathbb{P}^n_K$. To understand this phenomenon we consider the notion of integrable connections with zero $p$-curvature to extend Katz's version of Cartier's theorem for purely inseparable morphisms, where we solve the above characterization for the slightly general setup of coherent sheaves. Moreover, we also had to introduce some new local invariants attached to non-smooth points, as the differential degree. As an application of the theory developed here, we classify complete, geometrically integral, non-smooth regular curves $C$ of genus $3$, over a separably closed field $K$ of characteristic $3$, whose base extension $C \times_{\operatorname{Spec} K}{\operatorname{Spec} \overline{K}}$ is non-hyperelliptic with normalization having geometric genus $1$.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative hourglasses I: On classification of the Q-Fano 3-folds Gorenstein index 2 via Derived category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, Takagi used the methods of solving the Sarkisov links by calculating the corresponding Diophantine equations and the construction of key varieties to give all possible classifications and some implementations of a class $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano 3-fold with Fano index 1/2 and at worst $(1, 1, 1)/2$ or QODP singularities. Firstly, we use a method different from Kawamata's work to give the derived category formulas for general weighted blow-up and Kawamata weighted blow-up. On this basis, we study the changing behavior of the derived category of Takagi's varieties under Sarkisov links. Finally, by studying non-commutative projections, we give exceptional collections on the derived category of Takagi's varieties and their corresponding geometric meanings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the notion of $G$-coregularity of algebraic varieties endowed with an action of a finite group $G$. We compute $G$-coregularity of smooth del Pezzo surfaces of degree at least 6, and give a characterization of groups that can act on conic bundles with $G$-coregularity 0. We describe the relations between the notions of $G$-coregularity, $G$-log-canonical thresholds, $G$-rigidity, and exceptional quotient singularities.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of representations of the modular group into $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a large four-dimensional family of representations of the modular group into $G_2$. Precisely, this family is an etale cover of degree $96$ of an open subset of the moduli space of such representations. This moduli space has two main components, of dimensions one and four. The one-dimensional component consists of well-studied rigid representations, in the sese of Katz. We focus on the four-dimensional component which consists of representations that are not rigid. We also provide algebraic conditions to ensure that the specializations surject onto $G_2(\FF_p)$ for primes $p\geq 5$. These representations give new examples of $\phi$-congruence subgroups of the modular group as introduced in \cite{bff}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main objective in the present paper is to generalise the work of Blanco-Chac\'{o}n and Fornea on the $p$-adic Gross-Zagier formula for twisted triple product $p$-aidc $L$-function. We extend their main result to the case of finite slope families of Hilbert modular forms and also allow the prime $p$ to be inert in the real quadratic field $L$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic wheelgebras and noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the following statement made by V. Ginzburg and T. Schedler in [Selecta Math. (N.S.) 16 (2010), no. 4, 673-730]: "an adequate framework for doing noncommutative differential geometry is provided by the notion of wheelspace. Wheelspaces form a symmetric monoidal category". However, the category of wheelspaces turns out not to be monoidal. To address this, we introduce generalized wheelspaces, which do form a symmetric monoidal category and provide solid ground for the theory of wheelgebras. To support their first claim, Ginzburg and Schedler defined Poisson (Fock) wheelgebras in connection with Van den Bergh's double Poisson algebras via the Fock functor. We provide strong evidence to their claim by introducing symplectic wheelgebras and prove that the Fock functor sends smooth bisymplectic algebras, as defined by W. Crawley-Boevey, V. Ginzburg and P. Etingof, into our symplectic wheelgebras. In the process, we develop a Cartan calculus adapted to this wheeled context. Moreover, we present a wheeled version of the significant Van den Bergh functor, which facilitates a formalization of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, bridging the noncommutative and commutative frameworks. After establishing that the classical Van den Bergh functor factors through our wheeled version, we show that symplectic Fock wheelgebras naturally induce symplectic algebras on representation schemes.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of rigid affine surfaces: the identity component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the identity component of the automorphism group of a projective algebraic variety is an algebraic group. This is not true in general for quasi-projective varieties. In this note we address the question: given an affine algebraic surface $Y$, as to when the identity component ${\rm Aut}^0 (Y)$ of the automorphism group ${\rm Aut} (Y)$ is an algebraic group? We show that this happens if and only if $Y$ admits no effective action of the additive group of the field. In the latter case, ${\rm Aut}^0 (Y)$ is an algebraic torus of rank $\le 2$.</description>

Abstract: We generalise the notion of the Tate-Shafarevich group of an elliptic K3 surface with a section to the Tate-Shafarevich group of a K3 surface endowed with a linear system. The construction, which uses Grothendieck's special Brauer group, provides an efficient way to deal with moduli spaces of twisted sheaves supported on curves in a K3 surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the singularities and boundedness of a special kind of algebraic varieties so-called stable minimal models, which are constructed and studied by Birkar. Given a klt stable minimal model with bounded relative volume, if we fix the dimension, Iitaka volume, and a DCC set controlling coefficients, then we show that the singularities of the klt stable minimal model can be controlled uniformly. Furthermore, we prove that with certain bounded data, stable minimal models with klt singularities form a bounded family.</description>

Abstract: We show that the continuous \'etale cohomology groups $H^n_{\mathrm{cont}}(X,\mathbf{Z}_l(n))$ of smooth varieties $X$ over a finite field $k$ are spanned as $\mathbf{Z}_l$-modules by the $n$-th Milnor $K$-sheaf locally for the Zariski topology, for all $n\ge 0$. Here $l$ is a prime invertible in $k$. This is the first general unconditional result towards the conjectures of arXiv:math/9801017 (math.AG) which put together the Tate and the Beilinson conjectures relative to algebraic cycles on smooth projective $k$-varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is part of a series of articles in which we reproduce the statements regarding the abstract six-functor formalism developed by Liu-Zheng. In this paper, we prove a theorem, which is an $\infty$-categorical version for defining the exceptional pushforward functor in an abstract-six functor formalism. The article describes specific combinatorial simplicial sets related to compactifications and pullback squares. This theorem plays a key role in constructing the abstract six-functor formalism, which will be discussed in the forthcoming article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a totally real field, and $p$ be a rational prime that is unramified in $L$. We construct overconvergent families of classes of relative de Rham cohomology of the universal abelian scheme over Hilbert modular varieties associated to $L$. We show that these classes come equipped with Gauss-Manin connection. We prove convergence for $p$-adic iteration of this connection, improving upon a technique due to Andreatta-Iovita. We use this to construct a $p$-adic twisted triple product $L$-function associated to finite slope families of Hilbert modular forms, extending work of Blanco-Chacon-Fornea for Hida families.</description>
