      <title>Enhancing cluster synchronization in phase-lagged multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster synchronization in multilayer networks of phase oscillators with phase-lag poses significant challenges due to the destabilizing effects of delayed interactions. Leveraging the Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model, this study addresses these challenges by systematically exploring the role of natural frequency distributions in sustaining cluster synchronization under high phase-lag conditions. We focus on four distributions: uniform (uni-uni), partially degree-correlated (deg-uni, uni-deg), and fully degree-correlated (deg-deg), where oscillators' intrinsic frequencies align with their network connectivity. Through numerical and analytical investigations, we demonstrate that the deg-deg distribution, where both layers employ degree-matched frequencies, remarkably enhances synchronization stability, outperforming other configurations. We analyze two distinct network architectures: one composed entirely of nontrivial clusters and another combining trivial and nontrivial clusters. Results reveal that structural heterogeneity encoded in the deg-deg coupling counteracts phase-lag-induced desynchronization, enabling robust cluster synchronization even at large phase-lag values. Stability is rigorously validated via transverse Lyapunov exponents (TLEs), which confirm that deg-deg networks exhibit broader synchronization regimes compared to uniform or partially correlated systems. These findings provide critical insights into the interplay between topological heterogeneity and dynamical resilience, offering a framework for designing robust multilayer systems from delay-tolerant power grids to adaptive biological networks, where synchronization under phase-lag is paramount.</description>

      <title>Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.</description>
