      <title>Enhancing Speech Large Language Models with Prompt-Aware Mixture of Audio Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting audio encoders with large language models (LLMs) allows the LLM to perform various audio understanding tasks, such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio captioning (AC). Most research focuses on training an adapter layer to generate a unified audio feature for the LLM. However, different tasks may require distinct features that emphasize either semantic or acoustic aspects, making task-specific audio features more desirable. In this paper, we propose Prompt-aware Mixture (PaM) to enhance the Speech LLM that uses multiple audio encoders. Our approach involves using different experts to extract different features based on the prompt that indicates different tasks. Experiments demonstrate that with PaM, only one Speech LLM surpasses the best performances achieved by all single-encoder Speech LLMs on ASR, Speaker Number Verification, and AC tasks. PaM also outperforms other feature fusion baselines, such as concatenation and averaging.</description>

      <title>NOTA: Multimodal Music Notation Understanding for Visual Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic music is represented in two distinct forms: two-dimensional, visually intuitive score images, and one-dimensional, standardized text annotation sequences. While large language models have shown extraordinary potential in music, current research has primarily focused on unimodal symbol sequence text. Existing general-domain visual language models still lack the ability of music notation understanding. Recognizing this gap, we propose NOTA, the first large-scale comprehensive multimodal music notation dataset. It consists of 1,019,237 records, from 3 regions of the world, and contains 3 tasks. Based on the dataset, we trained NotaGPT, a music notation visual large language model. Specifically, we involve a pre-alignment training phase for cross-modal alignment between the musical notes depicted in music score images and their textual representation in ABC notation. Subsequent training phases focus on foundational music information extraction, followed by training on music notation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our NotaGPT-7B achieves significant improvement on music understanding, showcasing the effectiveness of NOTA and the training pipeline. Our datasets are open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MYTH-Lab/NOTA-dataset.</description>

Abstract: Audio classification is paramount in a variety of applications including surveillance, healthcare monitoring, and environmental analysis. Traditional methods frequently depend on intricate signal processing algorithms and manually crafted features, which may fall short in fully capturing the complexities of audio patterns. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the architecture and functioning of the human brain, presents a promising alternative for audio classification tasks. This survey provides an exhaustive examination of the current state-of-the-art in neuromorphic-based audio classification. It delves into the crucial components of neuromorphic systems, such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), memristors, and neuromorphic hardware platforms, highlighting their advantages in audio classification. Furthermore, the survey explores various methodologies and strategies employed in neuromorphic audio classification, including event-based processing, spike-based learning, and bio-inspired feature extraction. It examines how these approaches address the limitations of traditional audio classification methods, particularly in terms of energy efficiency, real-time processing, and robustness to environmental noise. Additionally, the paper conducts a comparative analysis of different neuromorphic audio classification models and benchmarks, evaluating their performance metrics, computational efficiency, and scalability. By providing a comprehensive guide for researchers, engineers and practitioners, this survey aims to stimulate further innovation and advancements in the evolving field of neuromorphic audio classification.</description>

      <title>Improving Streaming Speech Recognition With Time-Shifted Contextual Attention And Dynamic Right Context Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chunk-based inference stands out as a popular approach in developing real-time streaming speech recognition, valued for its simplicity and efficiency. However, because it restricts the model's focus to only the history and current chunk context, it may result in performance degradation in scenarios that demand consideration of future context. Addressing this, we propose a novel approach featuring Time-Shifted Contextual Attention (TSCA) and Dynamic Right Context (DRC) masking. Our method shows a relative word error rate reduction of 10 to 13.9% on the Librispeech dataset with the inclusion of in-context future information provided by TSCA. Moreover, we present a streaming automatic speech recognition pipeline that facilitates the integration of TSCA with minimal user-perceived latency, while also enabling batch processing capability, making it practical for various applications.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Speech Recognition Approach for Domain Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition systems often face challenges due to domain mismatch, particularly in real-world applications where domain-specific data is unavailable because of data accessibility and confidentiality constraints. Inspired by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for large language models (LLMs), this paper introduces a LLM-based retrieval-augmented speech recognition method that incorporates domain-specific textual data at the inference stage to enhance recognition performance. Rather than relying on domain-specific textual data during the training phase, our model is trained to learn how to utilize textual information provided in prompts for LLM decoder to improve speech recognition performance. Benefiting from the advantages of the RAG retrieval mechanism, our approach efficiently accesses locally available domain-specific documents, ensuring a convenient and effective process for solving domain mismatch problems. Experiments conducted on the CSJ database demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves speech recognition accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results on the CSJ dataset, even without relying on the full training data.</description>

      <title>Offload Rethinking by Cloud Assistance for Efficient Environmental Sound Recognition on LPWANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based environmental sound recognition has emerged as a crucial method for ultra-low-power environmental monitoring in biological research and city-scale sensing systems. These systems usually operate under limited resources and are often powered by harvested energy in remote areas. Recent efforts in on-device sound recognition suffer from low accuracy due to resource constraints, whereas cloud offloading strategies are hindered by high communication costs. In this work, we introduce ORCA, a novel resource-efficient cloud-assisted environmental sound recognition system on batteryless devices operating over the Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), targeting wide-area audio sensing applications. We propose a cloud assistance strategy that remedies the low accuracy of on-device inference while minimizing the communication costs for cloud offloading. By leveraging a self-attention-based cloud sub-spectral feature selection method to facilitate efficient on-device inference, ORCA resolves three key challenges for resource-constrained cloud offloading over LPWANs: 1) high communication costs and low data rates, 2) dynamic wireless channel conditions, and 3) unreliable offloading. We implement ORCA on an energy-harvesting batteryless microcontroller and evaluate it in a real world urban sound testbed. Our results show that ORCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to $80 \times$ in energy savings and $220 \times$ in latency reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Advancing User-Voice Interaction: Exploring Emotion-Aware Voice Assistants Through a Role-Swapping Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As voice assistants (VAs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, the need for emotion-aware systems that can recognize and respond appropriately to user emotions has grown. While significant progress has been made in speech emotion recognition (SER) and sentiment analysis, effectively addressing user emotions-particularly negative ones-remains a challenge. This study explores human emotional response strategies in VA interactions using a role-swapping approach, where participants regulate AI emotions rather than receiving pre-programmed responses. Through speech feature analysis and natural language processing (NLP), we examined acoustic and linguistic patterns across various emotional scenarios. Results show that participants favor neutral or positive emotional responses when engaging with negative emotional cues, highlighting a natural tendency toward emotional regulation and de-escalation. Key acoustic indicators such as root mean square (RMS), zero-crossing rate (ZCR), and jitter were identified as sensitive to emotional states, while sentiment polarity and lexical diversity (TTR) distinguished between positive and negative responses. These findings provide valuable insights for developing adaptive, context-aware VAs capable of delivering empathetic, culturally sensitive, and user-aligned responses. By understanding how humans naturally regulate emotions in AI interactions, this research contributes to the design of more intuitive and emotionally intelligent voice assistants, enhancing user trust and engagement in human-AI interactions.</description>

      <title>Audio signal interpolation using optimal transportation of spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating an artificial audio signal that interpolates between given source and target sounds. Our approach relies on the computation of Wasserstein barycenters of the source and target spectrograms, followed by phase reconstruction and inversion. In contrast with previous works, our new method considers the spectrograms globally and does not operate on a temporal frame-to-frame basis. An other contribution is to endow the transportation cost matrix with a specific structure that prohibits remote displacements of energy along the time axis, and for which optimal transport is made possible by leveraging the unbalanced transport framework. The proposed cost matrix makes sense from the audio perspective and also allows to reduce the computation load. Results with synthetic musical notes and real environmental sounds illustrate the potential of our novel approach.</description>

      <title>KAD: No More FAD! An Effective and Efficient Evaluation Metric for Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although being widely adopted for evaluating generated audio signals, the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD) suffers from significant limitations, including reliance on Gaussian assumptions, sensitivity to sample size, and high computational complexity. As an alternative, we introduce the Kernel Audio Distance (KAD), a novel, distribution-free, unbiased, and computationally efficient metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Through analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate KAD's advantages: (1) faster convergence with smaller sample sizes, enabling reliable evaluation with limited data; (2) lower computational cost, with scalable GPU acceleration; and (3) stronger alignment with human perceptual judgments. By leveraging advanced embeddings and characteristic kernels, KAD captures nuanced differences between real and generated audio. Open-sourced in the kadtk toolkit, KAD provides an efficient, reliable, and perceptually aligned benchmark for evaluating generative audio models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking machine learning for bowel sound pattern classification from tabular features to pretrained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of electronic stethoscopes and wearable recording sensors opened the door to the automated analysis of bowel sound (BS) signals. This enables a data-driven analysis of bowel sound patterns, their interrelations, and their correlation to different pathologies. This work leverages a BS dataset collected from 16 healthy subjects that was annotated according to four established BS patterns. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models to detect and/or classify BS patterns. The selection of considered models covers models using tabular features, convolutional neural networks based on spectrograms and models pre-trained on large audio datasets. The results highlight the clear superiority of pre-trained models, particularly in detecting classes with few samples, achieving an AUC of 0.89 in distinguishing BS from non-BS using a HuBERT model and an AUC of 0.89 in differentiating bowel sound patterns using a Wav2Vec 2.0 model. These results pave the way for an improved understanding of bowel sounds in general and future machine-learning-driven diagnostic applications for gastrointestinal examinations</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibravox is a dataset compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) containing audio recordings using five different body-conduction audio sensors : two in-ear microphones, two bone conduction vibration pickups and a laryngophone. The dataset also includes audio data from an airborne microphone used as a reference. The Vibravox corpus contains 45 hours of speech samples and physiological sounds recorded by 188 participants under different acoustic conditions imposed by an high order ambisonics 3D spatializer. Annotations about the recording conditions and linguistic transcriptions are also included in the corpus. We conducted a series of experiments on various speech-related tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement and speaker verification. These experiments were carried out using state-of-the-art models to evaluate and compare their performances on signals captured by the different audio sensors offered by the Vibravox dataset, with the aim of gaining a better grasp of their individual characteristics.</description>

      <title>Large Model Empowered Streaming Speech Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a large model-empowered streaming semantic communication system for speech transmission across various languages, named LSSC-ST. Specifically, we devise an edge-device collaborative semantic communication architecture by offloading the intricate semantic extraction and channel coding modules to edge servers, thereby reducing the computational burden on local devices. To support multilingual speech transmission, pre-trained large speech models are utilized to learn unified semantic features from speech in different languages, breaking the constraint of a single input language and enhancing the practicality of the LSSC-ST. Moreover, the input speech is sequentially streamed into the developed system as short speech segments, which enables low transmission latency without degrading the quality of the produced speech. A novel dynamic speech segmentation algorithm is proposed to further reduce the transmission latency by adaptively adjusting the duration of speech segments. According to simulation results, the LSSC-ST provides more accurate speech transmission and achieves a streaming manner with lower latency compared to the existing non-streaming semantic communication systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Multifaceted Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training Leveraging Hierarchical Selective State Space Model and Decoupled Cross-entropy Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prior efforts in building computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) systems often treat automatic pronunciation assessment (APA) and mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) as separate fronts: the former aims to provide multiple pronunciation aspect scores across diverse linguistic levels, while the latter focuses instead on pinpointing the precise phonetic pronunciation errors made by non-native language learners. However, it is generally expected that a full-fledged CAPT system should perform both functionalities simultaneously and efficiently. In response to this surging demand, we in this work first propose HMamba, a novel CAPT approach that seamlessly integrates APA and MDD tasks in parallel. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function, decoupled cross-entropy loss (deXent), specifically tailored for MDD to facilitate better-supervised learning for detecting mispronounced phones, thereby enhancing overall performance. A comprehensive set of empirical results on the speechocean762 benchmark dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach on APA. Notably, our proposed approach also yields a considerable improvement in MDD performance over a strong baseline, achieving an F1-score of 63.85%.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, we are open-sourcing our core speech recognition and diarization models for non-commercial use. We are releasing both a full production pipeline for developers as well as pared-down research models for experimentation. Rev hopes that these releases will spur research and innovation in the fast-moving domain of voice technology. The speech recognition models released today outperform all existing open source speech recognition models across a variety of long-form speech recognition domains.</description>

      <title>Everyday Speech in the Indian Subcontinent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: India has 1369 languages of which 22 are official. About 13 different scripts are used to represent these languages. A Common Label Set (CLS) was developed based on phonetics to address the issue of large vocabulary of units required in the End-to-End (E2E) framework for multilingual synthesis. The Indian language text is first converted to CLS. This approach enables seamless code switching across 13 Indian languages and English in a given native speaker's voice, which corresponds to everyday speech in the Indian subcontinent, where the population is multilingual.</description>

      <title>A Multi-modal Approach to Dysarthria Detection and Severity Assessment Using Speech and Text Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic detection and severity assessment of dysarthria are crucial for delivering targeted therapeutic interventions to patients. While most existing research focuses primarily on speech modality, this study introduces a novel approach that leverages both speech and text modalities. By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.</description>

      <title>Do Audio-Visual Segmentation Models Truly Segment Sounding Objects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional visual segmentation, audio-visual segmentation (AVS) requires the model not only to identify and segment objects but also to determine whether they are sound sources. Recent AVS approaches, leveraging transformer architectures and powerful foundation models like SAM, have achieved impressive performance on standard benchmarks. Yet, an important question remains: Do these models genuinely integrate audio-visual cues to segment sounding objects? In this paper, we systematically investigate this issue in the context of robust AVS. Our study reveals a fundamental bias in current methods: they tend to generate segmentation masks based predominantly on visual salience, irrespective of the audio context. This bias results in unreliable predictions when sounds are absent or irrelevant. To address this challenge, we introduce AVSBench-Robust, a comprehensive benchmark incorporating diverse negative audio scenarios including silence, ambient noise, and off-screen sounds. We also propose a simple yet effective approach combining balanced training with negative samples and classifier-guided similarity learning. Our extensive experiments show that state-of-theart AVS methods consistently fail under negative audio conditions, demonstrating the prevalence of visual bias. In contrast, our approach achieves remarkable improvements in both standard metrics and robustness measures, maintaining near-perfect false positive rates while preserving highquality segmentation performance.</description>
