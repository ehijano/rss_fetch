      <title>Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) for real-space systems has historically depended on Lagrange optimization techniques, primarily due to the inability of previously proposed electron density ansatze to ensure the normalization constraint. This study illustrates how leveraging contemporary generative models, notably normalizing flows (NFs), can surmount this challenge. We pioneer a Lagrangian-free optimization framework by employing these machine learning models as ansatze for the electron density. This novel approach also integrates cutting-edge variational inference techniques and equivariant deep learning models, offering an innovative alternative to the OF-DFT problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework by simulating a one-dimensional diatomic system, LiH, and comprehensive simulations of H$_2$, LiH, and H$_2$O molecules. The inherent flexibility of NFs facilitates initialization with promolecular densities, markedly enhancing the efficiency of the optimization process.</description>

      <title>A static quantum embedding scheme based on coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a static quantum embedding scheme, utilizing projection equations to solve coupled cluster (CC) amplitudes. To reduce the computational cost (for example, of a large basis set calculation), we solve the local fragment problem using a high-level coupled cluster method and address the environment problem with a lower-level M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP) perturbative method. This embedding approach is consistently formulated within the coupled cluster framework and will be called MP-CC. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through several prototypical molecular examples by analyzing a global quantity, that is, the total correlation energy of the system in the study of potential energy curves (PEC) and thermochemical reaction energies. We have shown that our method can achieve comparable accuracy both with a small and large basis set when the fragment Hilbert space size remains the same. Additionally, our results indicate that increasing the fragment size can systematically enhance the accuracy of observables, approaching the precision of the full coupled cluster solver.</description>

      <title>Improved Optimization for the Neural-network Quantum States and Tests on the Chromium Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of Neural-network Quantum States (NQS) has significantly advanced wave function ansatz research, sparking a resurgence in orbital space variational Monte Carlo (VMC) exploration. This work introduces three algorithmic enhancements to reduce computational demands of VMC optimization using NQS: an adaptive learning rate algorithm, constrained optimization, and block optimization. We evaluate the refined algorithm on complex multireference bond stretches of $\rm H_2O$ and $\rm N_2$ within the cc-pVDZ basis set and calculate the ground-state energy of the strongly correlated chromium dimer ($\rm Cr_2$) in the Ahlrichs SV basis set. Our results achieve superior accuracy compared to coupled cluster theory at a relatively modest CPU cost. This work demonstrates how to enhance optimization efficiency and robustness using these strategies, opening a new path to optimize large-scale Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)-based NQS more effectively and marking a substantial advancement in NQS's practical quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Use of multigrids to reduce the cost of performing interpolative separable density fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present an interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) based algorithm to calculate exact exchange in periodic mean field calculations. In the past, decomposing the two-electron integrals into tensor hypercontraction (THC) form using ISDF was the most expensive step of the entire mean field calculation. Here we show that by using a multigrid-ISDF algorithm both the memory and the CPU cost of this step can be reduced. The CPU cost is brought down from cubic scaling to quadratic scaling with a low computational prefactor which reduces the cost by almost two orders of magnitude. Thus, in the new algorithm, the cost of performing ISDF is largely negligible compared to other steps. Along with the CPU cost, the memory cost of storing the factorized two-electron integrals is also reduced by a factor of up to 35. With the current algorithm, we can perform Hartree-Fock calculations on a Diamond supercell containing more than 17,000 basis functions and more than 1,500 electrons on a single node with no disk usage. For this calculation, the cost of constructing the exchange matrix is only a factor of four slower than the cost of diagonalizing the Fock matrix. Augmenting our approach with linear scaling algorithms can further speed up the calculations.</description>

      <title>Accurate quantum Monte Carlo forces for machine-learned force fields: Ethanol as a benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is a powerful method to calculate accurate energies and forces for molecular systems. In this work, we demonstrate how we can obtain accurate QMC forces for the fluxional ethanol molecule at room temperature by using either multi-determinant Jastrow-Slater wave functions in variational Monte Carlo or just a single determinant in diffusion Monte Carlo. The excellent performance of our protocols is assessed against high-level coupled cluster calculations on a diverse set of representative configurations of the system. Finally, we train machine-learning force fields on the QMC forces and compare them to models trained on coupled cluster reference data, showing that a force field based on the diffusion Monte Carlo forces with a single determinant can faithfully reproduce coupled cluster power spectra in molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling electron-photon dynamics: a real-time investigation of energy redistribution in molecular polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the real-time electron-photon dynamics in long-range polariton-mediated energy transfer using a real-time quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster (RT-QED-CC) model, which allows for spatial and temporal visualization of transport processes. We compute the time evolution of photonic and molecular observables, such as the dipole moment and the photon coordinate, following the excitation of the system induced by short laser pulses. Our simulation highlights the different time scales of electrons and photons under light-matter strong coupling, the role of dark states, and the differences with the electronic (F\"orster and Dexter) energy exchange mechanisms. The developed method can simulate multiple high-intensity laser pulses while explicitly retaining electronic and electron-photon correlation and is thus suited for nonlinear optics and transient absorption spectroscopies of molecular polaritons.</description>

      <title>Simulating Electron Transfer in a Molecular Triad within an Optical Cavity Using NISQ Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm based on the Tensor-Train Thermo-Field Dynamics (TT-TFD) method to simulate the open quantum system dynamics of intramolecular charge transfer modulated by an optical cavity on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We apply our methodology to a model that describes the $\pi\pi^*$ to CT1 intermolecular charge transfer within the carotenoid-porphyrin-C60 molecular triad solvated in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and placed inside an optical cavity. We find how the dynamics is influenced by the cavity resonance frequency and strength of the light-matter interaction, showcasing the NISQ-based simulations to capture these effects. Furthermore, we compare the approximate predictions of Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) rate theory and Ring-Polymer Molecular Dynamics (RPMD) to numerically exact calculations, showing the capabilitis of quantum computing methods to assess the limitations of approximate methods.</description>

      <title>Time-Heterogeneity of the F\"orster Radius from Dipole Orientational Dynamics Explains Observed Dynamic Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: F\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a quantum mechanical phenomenon involving the non-radiative transfer of energy between coupled electric dipoles. Due to the strong dependence of FRET on the distance between the dipoles, it is frequently used as a ``molecular ruler" in biology, chemistry, and physics. This is done by placing dipolar molecules called dyes on molecules of interest. In time-resolved confocal single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments, the joint distribution of the FRET efficiency and the donor fluorescence lifetime can reveal underlying molecular conformational dynamics via deviation from their theoretical F\"orster relationship. This deviation is referred to as a dynamic shift. Quantifying the dynamic shift caused by the motion of the fluorescent dyes is essential to decoupling the dynamics of the studied molecules and the dyes. We develop novel Langevin models for the dye linker dynamics, including rotational dynamics, based on first physics principles and proper dye linker chemistry to match accessible volumes predicted by molecular dynamics simulations. By simulating the dyes' stochastic translational and rotational dynamics, we show that the observed dynamic shift can largely be attributed to the mutual orientational dynamics of the electric dipole moments associated with the dyes, not their accessible volume.</description>

      <title>QSPR Analysis with Curvilinear Regression Modeling and Temperature-based Topological Indices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Establishing quantitative correlations between various molecular properties and chemical structures is of great technological importance for environmental and medical aspects. These approaches are referred to as Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR), which relate the physicochemical or thermodynamic properties of compounds to their structures. The main goal of QSPR studies is to find a mathematical relationship between the property of interest and several molecular descriptors derived from the structure of the molecule. Topological indices are the molecular descriptors that characterize the formation of chemical compounds and predict certain physicochemical properties. In this study, the QSPR models are designed using certain temperature-based topological indices such as the sum connectivity temperature index, product connectivity temperature index, F-temperature index, and symmetric division temperature index to predict the thermodynamic properties, such as enthalpies of formation ($\Delta H^{0}_{f}$ \hspace{1mm} liquid), enthalpies of combustion ($\Delta H^{0}_{C}$ \hspace{1mm} liquid), and enthalpies of vaporization ($\Delta H^{0}_{vap}$ \hspace{1mm} gas) of monocarboxylic acids ($C_2H_{4}O_{2}$ - $C_{20}H_{40}O_{2}$). The relationship analysis between thermodynamic properties and topological indices is done using linear, quadratic, and cubic equations of a curvilinear regression model. These regression models are then compared.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stochastic Chemical Kinetics on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chemical Master Equation (CME) provides a highly accurate, yet extremely resource-intensive representation of a stochastic chemical reaction network and its kinetics due to the exponential scaling of its possible states with the number of reacting species. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum algorithms and hardware can be employed to model stochastic chemical kinetics as described by the CME using the Schl\"ogl Model of a trimolecular reaction network as an illustrative example. To ground our study of the performance of our quantum algorithms, we first determine a range of suitable parameters for constructing the stochastic Schl\"ogl operator in the mono- and bistable regimes of the model using a classical computer and then discuss the appropriateness of our parameter choices for modeling approximate kinetics on a quantum computer. We then apply the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to evaluate the smallest-magnitude eigenvalues, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$, which describe the transition rates of both the mono- and bi-stable systems, and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm combined with the Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition (VQSVD) algorithm to estimate the zeromode (ground state) of the bistable case. Our quantum computed results from both noisy and noiseless quantum simulations agree within a few percent with the classically computed eigenvalues and zeromode. Altogether, our work outlines a practical path toward the quantum solution of exponentially complex stochastic chemical kinetics problems and other related stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Ion Correlation Induced Non-monotonic Height Change and Microphase Separation of Polyelectrolyte Brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling ion correlations in inhomogeneous polymers and soft matters with spatially varying ionic strength or dielectric permittivity remains a great challenge. Here, we develop a new theory which systematically incorporates electrostatic fluctuations into the self-consistent field theory for polymers. Applied to polyelectrolyte brushes, the theory predicts that ion correlations induce non-monotonic change of the brush height: collapse followed by reexpansion. The scaling analysis elucidates the competition between the repulsive osmotic pressure due to translational entropy and the attraction induced by ion correlations. We also clarify the absence of causal relationship between the brush collapse-reexpansion and the inversion of the surface electrostatic potential. Furthermore, strong ion correlations can trigger microphase separation, either in the lateral direction as pinned micelles or in the normal direction as oscillatory layers. Our theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental results reported in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative of artificial intelligence with column chromatography, aiming to resolve inefficiencies and standardize data collection in chemical separation and purification domain. By developing an automated platform for precise data acquisition and employing advanced machine learning algorithms, we constructed predictive models to forecast key separation parameters, thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of chromatographic processes. The application of transfer learning allows the model to adapt across various column specifications, broadening its utility. A novel metric, separation probability ($S_p$), quantifies the likelihood of effective compound separation, validated through experimental verification. This study signifies a significant step forward int the application of AI in chemical research, offering a scalable solution to traditional chromatography challenges and providing a foundation for future technological advancements in chemical analysis and purification.</description>

      <title>A universal strategy for decoupling stiffness and extensibility polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the invention of polymer networks in the 19th century (e.g., crosslinked natural rubber by Goodyear), it has been a dogma that stiffer networks are less stretchable, a trade-off inherent to the molecular nature of polymer network strands. Here, we report a universal strategy for decoupling the stiffness and extensibility of single-network elastomers. Instead of using linear polymers as network strands, we use foldable bottlebrush polymers, which feature a collapsed backbone grafted with many linear side chains. Upon elongation, the collapsed backbone unfolds to release stored length, enabling remarkable extensibility. By contrast, the network elastic modulus is inversely proportional to the network strand mass and is determined by the side chains. We validate this concept by creating a series of unentangled single-network elastomers with nearly constant Young's modulus (30 kPa) while increasing tensile breaking strain by 40-fold, from 20% to 800%. We show that this strategy applies to networks of different polymer species and topologies. Our discovery opens an avenue for developing polymer networks with extraordinary mechanical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the increasing demand of quantum chemistry calculations in data-driven chemical research, the collaboration between industrial stakeholders and the quantum chemistry community has led to the development of GPU4PySCF, a GPU-accelerated Python package. This open-source project is accessible via its public GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf}. This paper outlines the primary features, innovations, and advantages of this package. When performing Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations on modern GPU platforms, GPU4PySCF delivers 30 times speedup over a 32-core CPU node, resulting in approximately 90% cost savings for most DFT tasks. The performance advantages and productivity improvements have been found in multiple industrial applications, such as generating potential energy surfaces, analyzing molecular properties, calculating solvation free energy, identifying chemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries, and accelerating neural-network methods. To make the package easy to extend and integrate with other Python packages, it is designed with PySCF-compatible interfaces and Pythonic implementations. This design choice enhances its coordination with the Python ecosystem.</description>

      <title>High-performance magnesium/sodium hybrid ion battery based on sodium vanadate oxide for reversible storage of Na+ and Mg2+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are a potential field for the energy storage of the future but are restricted by insufficient rate capability and rapid capacity degradation. Magnesium-sodium hybrid ion batteries (MSHBs) are an effective way to address these problems. Here, we report a new type of MSHBs that use layered sodium vanadate ((Na, Mn)V8O20 5H2O, Mn-NVO) cathodes coupled with an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode in Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. During electrochemical cycling, Mg2+ and Na+ co-participate in the cathode reactions, and the introduction of Na+ promotes the structural stability of the Mn-NVO cathode, as cleared by several ex-situ characterizations. Consequently, the Mn-NVO cathode presents great specific capacity (249.9 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1) and cycling (1500 cycles at 1500 mA g-1) in the Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. Besides, full battery displays long lifespan with 10,000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The rate performance and cycling stability of MSHBs have been improved by an economical and scalable method, and the mechanism for these improvements was discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this work we make some progress on studying four center integrals for the Coulomb energy for both Hartree Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations for small molecules. We consider basis wave functions of the form of an arbitrary radial wave function multiplied by a spherical harmonic and study four center Coulomb integrals for them. We reformulated these Coulomb four center integrals in terms of some derivatives of integrals of nearly factorable functions which then depend on the Bessel transform of the radial wave functions considered.</description>

      <title>Geometry-enhanced Pre-training on Interatomic Potentials</title>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and has been applied to various fields of physical science. However, the performance and transferability of MLIPs are limited by insufficient labeled training data, which require expensive ab initio calculations to obtain the labels, especially for complex molecular systems. To address this challenge, we design a novel geometric structure learning paradigm that consists of two stages. We first generate a large quantity of 3D configurations of target molecular system with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Then, we propose geometry-enhanced self-supervised learning consisting of masking, denoising, and contrastive learning to better capture the topology and 3D geometric information from the unlabeled 3D configurations. We evaluate our method on various benchmarks ranging from small molecule datasets to complex periodic molecular systems with more types of elements. The experimental results show that the proposed pre-training method can greatly enhance the accuracy of MLIPs with few extra computational costs and works well with different invariant or equivariant graph neural network architectures. Our method improves the generalization capability of MLIPs and helps to realize accurate MD simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Fail-Safe Quantum Chemical Calculations with Improved Machine-Learning Models</title>

Abstract: Easy and effective usage of computational resources is crucial for scientific calculations. Following our recent work of machine-learning (ML) assisted scheduling optimization [Ref: J. Comput. Chem. 2023, 44, 1174], we further propose 1) the improve ML models for the better predictions of computational loads, and as such, more elaborate load-balancing calculations can be expected; 2) the idea of coded computation, i.e. the integration of gradient coding, in order to introduce fault tolerance during the distributed calculations; and 3) their applications together with re-normalized exciton model with time-dependent density functional theory (REM-TDDFT) for calculating the excited states. Illustrated benchmark calculations include P38 protein, and solvent model with one or several excitable centers. The results show that the improved ML-assisted coded calculations can further improve the load-balancing and cluster utilization, and owing primarily profit in fault tolerance that aiming at the automated quantum chemical calculations for both ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Electron delocalization in aromaticity as a superposition phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the applications and extensions of the resource theory of quantum superposition within the realm of quantum chemistry. Specifically, we explore aromaticity, a fundamental concept originally developed to elucidate the structural symmetry, energetic stability, and chemical reactivity of benzene and its derivatives. While aromaticity and its counterpart, antiaromaticity, are associated with the delocalization of electrons between nonorthogonal atomic orbitals, they lack a universally accepted and comprehensive definition. We demonstrate that the genuine quantum superposition exhibited by biorthogonal atomic orbitals effectively captures the aromaticity order of representative monocyclic molecules. These findings reveal that the quantum resource theories hold significant implications, offering fresh insights into our comprehension of chemical bonding phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator and the related Steklov problem in spheroidal domains ranging from a needle to a disk. An explicit matrix representation of this operator for both interior and exterior problems is derived. We show how the anisotropy of spheroids affects the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator. As examples of physical applications, we discuss diffusion-controlled reactions on spheroidal partially reactive targets and the statistics of encounters between the diffusing particle and the spheroidal boundary.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins is modulated by amino acids in vitro and in vivo by regulating protein-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins is an intracellular process that is widely used by cells for many purposes. In living cells (in vivo), LLPS occurs in complex and crowded environments. Amino acids (AAs) are vital components of such environments, occupying a significant fraction of the cellular volume. In this work, we studied the effects of proline and other proteinogenic AAs on the LLPS of proteins, both in test tubes (in vitro) and in cells (in vivo). The effects of proline on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and LLPS of both bovine serum albumin (BSA, a folded protein) and the low-complexity domain of fused in sarcoma (FUS267, an intrinsically disordered protein) is first established in vitro. Then, the effects of proline and other proteinogenic AAs on the formation of stress granules (SGs) by LLPS in U2OS and HeLa cells are studied. We find that the presence of AAs renders the net interaction between proteins more repulsive (i.e. stabilizes protein solution), thus suppressing protein phase separation in vitro and in vivo. We also show that the formation of SGs is suppressed by AAs using both immunofluorescence and live-cell microscopy. Our study reveals an underappreciated role of cellular AAs in modulating intracellular phase separation. It may find biomedical applications, especially in the treatment of protein aggregation diseases.</description>
