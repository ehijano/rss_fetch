      <title>Robust Attitude Control of Nonlinear Multi-Rotor Dynamics with LFT Models and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attitude stabilization of unmanned aerial vehicles in uncertain environments presents significant challenges due to nonlinear dynamics, parameter variations, and sensor limitations. This paper presents a comparative study of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ and classical PID controllers for multi-rotor attitude regulation in the presence of wind disturbances and gyroscope noise. The flight dynamics are modeled using a linear parameter-varying (LPV) framework, where nonlinearities and parameter variations are systematically represented as structured uncertainties within a linear fractional transformation formulation. A robust controller based on $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ formulation is designed using only gyroscope measurements to ensure guaranteed performance bounds. Nonlinear simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust controllers compared to classical PID control, showing significant improvement in attitude regulation under severe wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>Combined Learning and Control: A New Paradigm for Optimal Control with Unknown Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the combined learning-and-control (CLC) approach, which is a new way to solve optimal control problems with unknown dynamics by unifying model-based control and data-driven learning. The key idea is simple: we design a controller to be optimal for a proxy objective built on an available model while penalizing mismatches with the real system, so that the resulting controller is also optimal for the actual system. Building on the original CLC formulation, we demonstrate the framework to the linear quadratic regulator problem and make three advances: (i) we show that the CLC penalty is a sequence of stage-specific weights rather than a single constant; (ii) we identify when these weights can be set in advance and when they must depend on the (unknown) dynamics; and (iii) we develop a lightweight learning loop that tunes the weights directly from data without abandoning the benefits of a model-based design. We provide a complete algorithm and an empirical study against common baseline methods. The results clarify where prior knowledge suffices and where learning is essential, and they position CLC as a practical, theoretically grounded bridge between classical optimal control and modern learning methods.</description>

      <title>MM-LMPC: Multi-Modal Learning Model Predictive Control via Bandit-Based Mode Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC) improves performance on iterative tasks by leveraging data from previous executions. At each iteration, LMPC constructs a sampled safe set from past trajectories and uses it as a terminal constraint, with a terminal cost given by the corresponding cost-to-go. While effective, LMPC heavily depends on the initial trajectories: states with high cost-to-go are rarely selected as terminal candidates in later iterations, leaving parts of the state space unexplored and potentially missing better solutions. For example, in a reach-avoid task with two possible routes, LMPC may keep refining the initially shorter path while neglecting the alternative path that could lead to a globally better solution. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-Modal LMPC (MM-LMPC), which clusters past trajectories into modes and maintains mode-specific terminal sets and value functions. A bandit-based meta-controller with a Lower Confidence Bound (LCB) policy balances exploration and exploitation across modes, enabling systematic refinement of all modes. This allows MM-LMPC to escape high-cost local optima and discover globally superior solutions. We establish recursive feasibility, closed-loop stability, asymptotic convergence to the best mode, and a logarithmic regret bound. Simulations on obstacle-avoidance tasks validate the performance improvements of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Mixed-Integer Nonlinear MPC of Positive-Negative Pressure Pneumatic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive-negative pressure regulation is critical to soft robotic actuators, enabling large motion ranges and versatile actuation modes. However, it remains challenging due to complex nonlinearities, oscillations, and direction-dependent, piecewise dynamics introduced by affordable pneumatic valves and the bidirectional architecture. We present a model-based control framework that couples a physics-grounded switched nonlinear plant model (inflation/deflation modes) with a mixed-integer nonlinear model predictive controller (MI-NMPC). The controller co-optimizes mode scheduling and PWM inputs to realize accurate reference tracking while enforcing input constraints and penalizing energy consumption and excessive switching. To make discrete mode decisions tractable, we employ a Combinatorial Integral Approximation that relaxes binary mode variables to continuous surrogates within the valve-scheduling layer. With parameters identified from the physical system, simulations with step and sinusoidal references validate the proposed MI-NMPC, showing a consistently favorable trade-off among accuracy, control effort, and switching, and outperforming conventional PID and NMPC with heuristic mode selection.</description>

      <title>Four-Port Probe Stations and SOLR Calibration Standard Design up to 125 GHz on 28 nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two innovative four-port probe stations developed by FormFactor Incorporated (FFI) and MPI Corporation (MPI), and a four-port calibration standard design up to 125 GHz for the probe stations. True four-port probing at mmWave and beyond does not yet exist, but is anticipated for future multi-band wireless devices using several antennas and RF chains. The four-port probe stations are housed in the THz measurement facility at NYU and allow simultaneous probing from East, West, North, and South orientations, which presents challenges for calibration. An on-chip Short-Open-Load-Reciprocal (SOLR) calibration (cal) standard is designed leveraging UMC's 28 nm CMOS process. S/O/L standard S-parameters are extracted using a virtual multiline Thru-Reflect-Line (mTRL) cal and used to validate SOLR cal performance via simulations up to 125 GHz. The novel probing solutions from MPI and FFI, along with the SOLR cal, open up considerable opportunities for precise RF characterization across wide frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>An Interpolation-based Scheme for Rapid Frequency-Domain System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a frequency-domain system identification scheme based on barycentric interpolation and weight optimization. The scheme is related to the Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson (AAA) algorithm for model reduction, but uses an adaptive algorithm for selection of frequency points for interrogating the system response, as would be required in identification versus model reduction. The scheme is particularly suited for systems in which any one sinusoidal response run is long or expensive, and thus there is an incentive to reduce the total number of such runs. Two key features of our algorithm are the use of transient data in sinusoidal runs to both optimize the barycentric weights, and automated next-frequency selection on an adaptive grid. Both are done with error criteria that are proxies for a system's $H^2$ and $H^\infty$ norms respectively. Furthermore, the optimization problem we formulate is convex, and can optionally guarantee stability of the identified system. Computational results on a high-order, lightly damped structural system highlights the efficacy of this scheme.</description>

      <title>Development and Field Validation of a Fully Customised Vehicle Scanning System on Two Full-Scale Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the structural integrity of bridges is essential for maintaining infrastructure safety and promoting long-term sustainability. In this context, Indirect Structural Health Monitoring (ISHM) through drive-by bridge inspection emerges as a promising alternative to traditional inspection methods, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution by using vehicle-mounted sensors to assess the condition of bridges without requiring direct instrumentation. This study introduces the first purpose-built electric inspection vehicle specifically designed for drive-by bridge inspection. The autonomous platform is capable of maintaining a constant low speed and offers customisable operational parameters to maximise the accuracy and repeatability of indirect sensing, capabilities not achieved in previous studies. The vehicle is deployed within an ISHM framework and tested on two full-scale bridges to evaluate its effectiveness in capturing structural dynamic responses. Two unsupervised frameworks are then employed to analyse the collected data to identify features indicative of bridge properties and structural condition. The promising findings from this study demonstrate the practical feasibility of the approach. The study also shows the potential of ISHM as a viable tool for efficient bridge monitoring, contributing to the development of next-generation structural health monitoring systems that can enhance safety, optimise maintenance strategies, and support the longevity of critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Formation Control via Rotation Symmetry Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a distributed formation control strategy for multi-agent systems based only on rotation symmetry constraints. We propose a potential function that enforces inter-agent \textbf{rotational} symmetries, with its gradient defining the control law driving the agents toward a desired symmetric and planar configuration. We show that only $(n-1)$ edges, the minimal connectivity requirement, are sufficient to implement the control strategy, where $n$ is the number of agents. We further augment the design to address the \textbf{maneuvering problem}, enabling the formation to undergo coordinated translations, rotations, and scalings along a predefined virtual trajectory. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Flexibility of Buildings: From Quantification to Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buildings represent a promising flexibility source to support the integration of renewable energy sources, as they may shift their heating energy consumption over time without impacting users' comfort. However, a building's predicted flexibility potential is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a typically inaccurate building thermal model. Hence, this paper presents an uncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained formulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally model real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback policies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound around the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility quantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings participate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some increase in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies. Additionally, it is demonstrated that accounting for uncertainties in the flexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are not available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem financially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the cost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants. Hence, we suggest a comfort-preserving approach, aiming to truly reflect thermal discomfort on the economic flexibility revenue, to obtain a fairer comparison.</description>

      <title>TubeDAgger: Reducing the Number of Expert Interventions with Stochastic Reach-Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning deals with training a novice policy from expert demonstrations in an online fashion. The established DAgger algorithm trains a robust novice policy by alternating between interacting with the environment and retraining of the network. Many variants thereof exist, that differ in the method of discerning whether to allow the novice to act or return control to the expert. We propose the use of stochastic reachtubes - common in verification of dynamical systems - as a novel method for estimating the necessity of expert intervention. Our approach does not require fine-tuning of decision thresholds per environment and effectively reduces the number of expert interventions, especially when compared with related approaches that make use of a doubt classification model.</description>

      <title>Accurate Small-Signal Modeling of Digitally Controlled Buck Converters with ADC-PWM Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital control has become increasingly widespread in modern power electronic converters. When acquiring feedback signals such as the inductor current, synchronizing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the digital pulse-width modulator (DPWM) is commonly employed to accurately track their steady-state average. However, the small-signal implications of such synchronization have not been investigated. This paper presents an exact small-signal model for digitally controlled buck converters operating in forced continuous-conduction mode (FCCM) under constant-frequency current-mode control, explicitly accounting for DPWM-ADC synchronization. Using a sampled-data framework, the proposed model captures all sideband effects introduced by the sampling process, yielding precise predictions of both analog and digital loop gains, even at frequencies beyond the switching and sampling frequencies. Both asymmetrical and symmetrical carrier modulations are considered. Furthermore, the digital loop gain is derived in closed form using the modified z-transform, enabling low-complexity compensator design and stability assessment. Within this framework, the analog loop gain can be directly obtained from the digital loop gain, thereby eliminating the need for computationally intensive infinite series evaluations. The validity of the proposed model is confirmed through both simulation and experimental results.</description>

      <title>Structuring Automotive Data for Systems Engineering: A Taxonomy-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle data is essential for advancing data-driven development throughout the automotive lifecycle, including requirements engineering, design, verification, and validation, and post-deployment optimization. Developers currently collect data in a decentralized and fragmented manner across simulations, test benches, and real-world driving, resulting in data silos, inconsistent formats, and limited interoperability. This leads to redundant efforts, inefficient integration, and suboptimal use of data. This fragmentation results in data silos, inconsistent storage structures, and limited interoperability, leading to redundant data collection, inefficient integration, and suboptimal application. To address these challenges, this article presents a structured literature review and develops an inductive taxonomy for automotive data. This taxonomy categorizes data according to its sources and applications, improving data accessibility and utilization. The analysis reveals a growing emphasis on real-world driving and machine learning applications while highlighting a critical gap in data availability for requirements engineering. By providing a systematic framework for structuring automotive data, this research contributes to more efficient data management and improved decision-making in the automotive industry.</description>

      <title>Real-time Operation of Electric Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand System Considering Power System Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric autonomous mobility-on-demand (EAMoD) systems are emerging all over the world. However, their potential swarm charging in depots may deteriorate operation of the power system, further in turn affecting EAMoD system's optimal operation. To prevent this latent risk, we develop a real-time coordination framework for the EAMoD system and the power system. First, the temporal-spatial characteristics of EAMoD fleets are fully described based on a Markov decision process model, including serving trips, repositioning, and charging. Second, charger accessibility of EAMoD depot charging is well modeled as real-world configuration, wherein fast and slow charge piles are both included. Third, the power system regulation model provides real-time charging regulation constraints for EAMoD systems to prevent potential overload and undervoltage. To address the poor solution quality attributed to the complex decision space of the EAMoD system, this paper proposes a piecewise linear-based approximate dynamic programming algorithm combined with model predictive control. Numerical experiments in the Manhattan and a 14-node power distribution network validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and underscore the necessity of system coordination.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pricing of Electric Vehicle Charging on Coupled Power-Transportation Network based on Generalized Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, charging service providers are emerging along with the prevalence of electric vehicles. These providers need to strategically optimize their charging prices to improve the profits considering operation conditions of the coupled power-transportation network. However, the optimal pricing problem generally involves the user equilibrium model, which leads to a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. As a result, the pricing problem is non-convex and computationally intractable especially for large-scale network. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized sensitivity analysis approach for optimal pricing of electric vehicle charging on coupled power-transportation network. Specifically, we adopt a sensitivity analysis to capture the best response of charging demand to charging price in the gradient form. Consequently, charging service providers can make pricing decisions based on the gradient information instead of the conventional KKT conditions of the user equilibrium model. We then propose a tailored gradient descent algorithm to solve the whole pricing problem. The mathematical proof of validity is given and the time complexity of the proposed algorithm is theoretically polynomial. Numerical experiments on different scales of networks verify the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm, indicating its potential in evaluating the impact of the optimal pricing on the operational performance of large-scale coupled power-transportation network.</description>

      <title>A Model-Based Extended State Observer for Discrete-Time Linear Multivariable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model-based extended state observer (MB-ESO) and its variant are proposed for discrete-time linear multivariable systems, where multiple disturbances are defined as an extended state vector in the same manner as in the original formulation of ESO. The variant MB-ESO extends the MB-ESO to address cases where the disturbance gain matrix is non-diagonal. Leveraging the connection between the variant MB-ESO and the well-known unknown input observer (UIO), the condition for the existence of a MB-ESO and its variant in multivariable systems is established, for the first time, i.e., no invariant zeros exist between the disturbances and the plant outputs. It is shown that, with the observer eigenvalues all placed at the origin and the subsystems decoupled, the variant MB-ESO produces the identical disturbance estimation as that of UIO. Moreover, the error characteristics of MB-ESO and its variant are analyzed and the transfer functions associated with the disturbance estimation errors are derived. It is demonstrated both mathematically and in simulations that the disturbance estimation error of MB-ESO decreases monotonically with respect to both the observer eigenvalues and time.</description>

      <title>Gain-Scheduled Passive Fault-Tolerant Control Design for Dual-System UAV Transition Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-system UAVs with vertical take-off and landing capabilities have become increasingly popular in recent years. As a safety-critical system, it is important that a dual-system UAV can maintain safe flight after faults/failures occur. This paper proposes a gain-scheduled passive fault-tolerant control (PFTC) method for the transition flight of dual-system UAVs. In this novel FTC design method, the model uncertainties arising from the loss of control effectiveness caused by actuator faults/failures, for the first time, are treated as model input uncertainty, allowing us to use multiplicative uncertainty descriptions to represent it. The advantages of the proposed method consist in significantly reducing the number of design points, thereby simplifying the control synthesis process and improving the efficiency of designing the FTC system for dual-system UAV transition flight compared with the existing FTC design methods. As a general method, it can be applied to the design of FTC systems with multiple uncertain parameters and multiple channels. The developed passive FTC system is validated on a nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom simulator. The simulation results demonstrate that the gain-scheduled structured H infinity (GS SHIF) PFTC system provides superior fault tolerance performance compared with the LQR and structured H infinity control systems, thereby showcasing the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed GS SHIF PFTC approach.</description>

      <title>Grid Frequency Stability Support Potential of Data Center: A Quantitative Assessment of Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of data center infrastructure is reshaping power system dynamics by significantly increasing electricity demand while also offering potential for fast and controllable flexibility. To ensure reliable operation under such conditions, the frequency secured unit commitment problem must be solved with enhanced modeling of demand side frequency response. In this work, we propose a data-driven linearization framework based on decision tree based constraint learning to embed nonlinear nadir frequency constraints into mixed-integer linear programming. This approach enables tractable optimization of generation schedules and fast frequency response from data centers. Through case studies on both a benchmark system and a 2030 future scenario with higher DC penetration, we demonstrate that increasing the proportion of flexible DC load consistently improves system cost efficiency and supports renewable integration. However, this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns, motivating the introduction of the Marginal Flexibility Value metric to quantify the economic value of additional flexibility. The results highlight that as DCs become a larger share of system load, their active participation in frequency response will be increasingly indispensable for maintaining both economic and secure system operations.</description>

      <title>Predictive Control Barrier Functions for Discrete-Time Linear Systems with Unmodeled Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a predictive control barrier function (PCBF) framework for enforcing state constraints in discrete-time systems with unknown relative degree, which can be caused by input delays or unmodeled input dynamics. Existing discrete-time CBF formulations typically require the construction of auxiliary barrier functions when the relative degree is greater than one, which complicates implementation and may yield conservative safe sets. The proposed PCBF framework addresses this challenge by extending the prediction horizon to construct a CBF for an associated system with relative degree one. As a result, the superlevel set of the PCBF coincides with the safe set, simplifying constraint enforcement and eliminating the need for auxiliary functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on a discrete-time double integrator with input delay and a bicopter system with position constraints.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control via Recurrent Tracking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of synthesizing safety-critical controllers for high-order nonlinear systems, where constructing valid Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) remains computationally intractable. Leveraging layered control, we design CBFs in reduced-order models (RoMs) while regulating full-order models' (FoMs) dynamics at the same time. Traditional Lyapunov tracking functions are required to decrease monotonically, but systematic synthesis methods for such functions exist only for fully-actuated systems. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Recurrent Tracking Functions (RTFs), which replace the monotonic decay requirement with a weaker finite-time recurrence condition. This relaxation permits transient deviations of tracking errors while ensuring safety. By augmenting CBFs for RoMs with RTFs, we construct recurrent CBFs (RCBFs) whose zero-superlevel set is control $\tau$-recurrent, and guarantee safety for all initial states in such a set when RTFs are satisfied. We establish theoretical safety guarantees and validate the approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating RTFs' effectiveness and the safety of FoMs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Robust Control Method Combining DNN-Based NMPC Approximation and PI Control: Application to Exoskeleton Squat Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks (NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness, leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time, the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than 5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that, under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip, respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is 99.93% lower than that of NMPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum network protocol development is crucial to realizing a production-grade network that can support distributed sensing, secure communication, and utility-scale quantum computation. However, the transition from laboratory demonstration to deployable networks requires software implementations of architectures and protocols tailored to the unique constraints of quantum systems. This paper reviews the current state of software implementations for quantum networks, organized around the three-plane abstraction of infrastructure, logical, and control/service planes. We cover software for both designing quantum network protocols (e.g., SeQUeNCe, QuISP, and NetSquid) and operating them, with a focus on essential control/service plane functions such as entanglement, topology, and resource management, in a proposed taxonomy. Our review highlights a persistent gap between theoretical protocol proposals and their realization in simulators or testbeds, particularly in dynamic topology and network management. We conclude by outlining open challenges and proposing a roadmap for developing scalable software architectures to enable hybrid, large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Agentic Framework for Autonomous Drone-Based Visual Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous inspection systems are essential for ensuring the performance and longevity of industrial assets. Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated significant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited to digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world environments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions are two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous drone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function executions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual inspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial readouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a head agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The head agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker agents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions. Operating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act, evaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation (e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g., locating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a feedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives while preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated environment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and quantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and workflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent communication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible alternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous problem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Nonlinear Sheaf Diffusion for Multi-Agent Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular sheaves and sheaf Laplacians provide a far-reaching generalization of graphs and graph Laplacians, resulting in a wide array of applications ranging from machine learning to multi-agent control. In the context of multi-agent systems, so called coordination sheaves provide a unifying formalism that models heterogeneous agents and coordination goals over undirected communication topologies, and applying sheaf diffusion drives agents to achieve their coordination goals. Existing literature on sheaf diffusion assumes that agents can communicate and compute updates synchronously, which is an unrealistic assumption in many scenarios where communication delays or heterogeneous agents with different compute capabilities cause disagreement among agents. To address these challenges, we introduce asynchronous nonlinear sheaf diffusion. Specifically, we show that under mild assumptions on the coordination sheaf and bounded delays in communication and computation, nonlinear sheaf diffusion converges to a minimizer of the Dirichlet energy of the coordination sheaf at a linear rate proportional to the delay bound. We further show that this linear convergence is attained from arbitrary initial conditions and the analysis depends on the spectrum of the sheaf Laplacian in a manner that generalizes the standard graph Laplacian case. We provide several numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a revolutionary paradigm in terahertz (THz) photonics, enabling metasurfaces with theoretically infinite quality factors (Q-factors) and unprecedented light-matter control. This review synthesizes a decade of progress in THz-BIC research, tracing the evolution from foundational symmetry-protected designs to application-optimized quasi-BICs. We dissect multipolar origins, topological robustness, and symmetry-breaking strategies underpinning high-Q resonances, alongside computational frameworks for predictive design. The timeline highlights key milestones: early dielectric metasurfaces with high Q-factor, flexible biosensors achieving microgram detection limits, and Kerker-conditioned gas spectrometers reducing path lengths by few orders of magnitude. Emerging frontiers in reconfigurable MEMS-BICs and chiral quantum photonics are critically evaluated. Despite breakthroughs, scalability barriers persist for 6G integration, including nano-fabrication tolerances, material loss trade-offs, and dynamic control gaps. This review establishes BIC metasurfaces as pivotal enablers of compact, high-efficiency THz technologies poised to bridge the gap between fundamental discovery and commercialization of THz-based 6G communication and MedTech.</description>

      <title>Combining Large Language Models and Gradient-Free Optimization for Automatic Control Policy Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical control tuning.

      <description>arXiv:2510.00384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become integral enablers for the Internet of Things (IoT) by offering enhanced coverage, improved connectivity and access to remote areas. A critical challenge limiting their operational capacity lies in the energy constraints of both aerial platforms and ground-based sensors. This paper explores WLPT as a transformative solution for sustainable energy provisioning in UAV-assisted IoT networks. We first systematically investigate the fundamental principles of WLPT and analysis the comparative advantages. Then, we introduce three operational paradigms for system integration, identify key challenges, and discuss corresponding potential solutions. In case study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to address the coordination and optimization challenges in WLPT-enabled UAV-assisted IoT data collection. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves energy sustainability and data freshness. Finally, we discuss some future directions.</description>

      <title>Annealed Ensemble Kalman Inversion for Constrained Nonlinear Model Predictive Control: An ADMM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm for solving constrained nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problems. First, the stage-wise nonlinear inequality constraints in the NMPC problem are embedded via an augmented Lagrangian with nonnegative slack variables. We then show that the unconstrained augmented Lagrangian formulation of the NMPC admits a Bayesian interpretation: under a Gaussian observation model, its minimizers coincide with MAP estimators, enabling solution via EKI. However, since the nonnegativity constraint on the slacks cannot be enforced via Gaussian noise, our proposed algorithm results in a two-block ADMM that alternates between (i) a primal step that minimizes the unconstrained augmented Lagrangian, (ii) a nonnegativity projection for the slacks, and (iii) a dual ascent step. To balance exploration and convergence, an annealing schedule tempers covariances and penalty weights, thereby encouraging global search early and precise constraint satisfaction later. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we compare it with another iterative sampling-based approach based on Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, called DIAL-MPC.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing teams of multiple robots is advantageous for handling bulky objects. Many related works focus on multi-manipulator systems, which are limited by workspace constraints. In this paper, we extend a classical hybrid motion-force controller to a team of legged manipulator systems, enabling collaborative loco-manipulation of rigid objects with a force-closed grasp. Our novel approach allows the robots to flexibly coordinate their movements, achieving efficient and stable object co-manipulation and transport, validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Global convergence of Oja's component flow for general square matrices and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global convergence properties of the Oja flow, a continuous-time algorithm for principal component extraction, for general square matrices. The Oja flow is a matrix differential equation on the Stiefel manifold designed to extract a dominant subspace. While its analysis has traditionally been restricted to symmetric positive-definite matrices, where it acts as a gradient flow, recent applications have extended its use to general matrices. In this non-symmetric case, the flow extracts the invariant subspace corresponding to the eigenvalues with the largest real parts. However, prior convergence results have been purely local, leaving the global behavior as an open problem. This paper fills this gap by providing a comprehensive global convergence analysis, establishing that the flow converges exponentially for almost all initial conditions. We also propose a modification to the algorithm that enhances its numerical stability. As an application of this theory, we develop novel methods for the model reduction of linear dynamical systems and the synthesis of low-rank stabilizing controllers.</description>

      <title>Product-oriented Product-Process-Resource Asset Network and its Representation in AutomationML for Asset Administration Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and (ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource (PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Urban VANETs Stability: A Single-Hop Clustering Strategy in Metropolitan Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), a subclass of Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), are expected to play a crucial role in the future of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). A key objective of VANETs is to enable efficient and cost-effective communication among vehicles while supporting a large number of network participants and minimizing infrastructure dependency. However, the highly dynamic nature of vehicular networks poses significant challenges to their deployment. Clustering techniques are employed to address these challenges, with a strong emphasis on stability, as they directly influence the routing process and enhance the quality of service (QoS). This paper explores the feasibility of reducing reliance on roadside units (RSUs) in metropolitan areas while improving cluster stability. We propose an efficient clustering algorithm tailored for urban environments, leveraging existing metropolitan infrastructure to compensate for the absence of RSUs. Our approach designates public transportation buses as primary cluster heads (CHs), minimizing reliance on additional infrastructure, while stand-alone vehicles (SAVs) dynamically select additional CHs. Through comprehensive case studies and comparative analysis with existing algorithms, our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method across different transmission ranges (TRs).</description>

      <title>Non-submodular Visual Attention for Robot Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>A Neuro-Fuzzy System for Interpretable Long-Term Stock Market Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the real world stock market index S\&amp;P500. Initial results show potential for interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs, suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ROSflight is a lean, open-source autopilot ecosystem for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Designed by researchers for researchers, it is built to lower the barrier to entry to UAV research and accelerate the transition from simulation to hardware experiments by maintaining a lean (not full-featured), well-documented, and modular codebase. This publication builds on previous treatments and describes significant additions to the architecture that improve the modularity and usability of ROSflight, including the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, supported hardware, low-level actuator mixing, and the simulation environment. We believe that these changes improve the usability of ROSflight and enable ROSflight to accelerate research in areas like advanced-air mobility. Hardware results are provided, showing that ROSflight is able to control a multirotor over a serial connection at 400 Hz while closing all control loops on the companion computer.</description>

      <title>ROSplane 2.0: A Fixed-Wing Autopilot for Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) research requires the integration of cutting-edge technology into existing autopilot frameworks. This process can be arduous, requiring extensive resources, time, and detailed knowledge of the existing system. ROSplane is a lean, open-source fixed-wing autonomy stack built by researchers for researchers. It is designed to accelerate research by providing clearly defined interfaces with an easily modifiable framework. Powered by ROS 2, ROSplane allows for rapid integration of low or high-level control, path planning, or estimation algorithms. A focus on lean, easily understood code and extensive documentation lowers the barrier to entry for researchers. Recent developments to ROSplane improve its capacity to accelerate UAV research, including the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, enhanced estimation and control algorithms, increased modularity, and an improved aerodynamic modeling pipeline. This aerodynamic modeling pipeline significantly reduces the effort of transitioning from simulation to real-world testing without requiring expensive system identification or computational fluid dynamics tools. ROSplane's architecture reduces the effort required to integrate new research tools and methods, expediting hardware experimentation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we employ an input-output approach to expand the study of cooperative multi-agent control and optimization problems characterized by mean-field interactions that admit decentralized and selfish solutions. The setting involves $n$ independent agents that interact solely through a shared cost function, which penalizes deviations of each agent from the group's average collective behavior. Building on our earlier results established for homogeneous agents, we extend the framework to nonidentical agents and show that, under a diagonal dominant interaction of the collective dynamics, with bounded local open-loop dynamics, the optimal controller for $H_\infty$ and $H_2$ norm minimization remains decentralized and selfish in the limit as the number of agents $n$ grows to infinity.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability Analysis Evaluating Bilevel Optimal Power Flow Approaches for Multiple Load Cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents two methodologies to enhance vulnerability assessment in power systems using bilevel attacker-defender network interdiction models. First, we introduce a systematic evaluation procedure for comparing different optimal power flow formulations in the lower-level problem. We demonstrate the procedure for a comparison of the widely used DC approximation and a linearized AC optimal power flow model. Second, we propose a novel scoring methodology to identify and prioritize critical attack vectors across diverse load and generation scenarios. Both methodologies go beyond traditional worst-case analysis. Case studies on a SimBench high-voltage test grid show that the DC approach fails to detect a significant portion of critical vulnerabilities. The scoring methodology further demonstrates the dependency of vulnerabilities on the considered load case and time step, highlighting the importance of assessing multiple scenarios and going beyond worst-case solutions. The proposed methodologies enhance power system vulnerability assessment and can support the effective development of robust defense strategies for future power systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies resilient leader-follower consensus with a bounded number of adversaries. Existing approaches typically require robustness conditions of the entire network to guarantee resilient consensus. However, the behavior of such systems when these conditions are not fully met remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the notion of partial leader-follower consensus, in which a subset of non-adversarial followers successfully tracks the leader's reference state despite insufficient robustness. We propose a novel distributed algorithm - the Bootstrap Percolation and Mean Subsequence Reduced (BP-MSR) algorithm - and establish sufficient conditions for individual followers to achieve consensus via the BP-MSR algorithm in arbitrary time-varying graphs. We validate our findings through simulations, demonstrating that our method guarantees partial leader-follower consensus, even when standard resilient consensus algorithms fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from exogenous stochastic processes. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distributed optimization problem over a graphon with a continuum of nodes, which is regarded as the limit of the distributed networked optimization as the number of nodes goes to infinity. Each node has a private local cost function. The global cost function, which all nodes cooperatively minimize, is the integral of the local cost functions on the node set. We propose stochastic gradient descent and gradient tracking algorithms over the graphon. We establish a general lemma for the upper bound estimation related to a class of time-varying differential inequalities with negative linear terms, based upon which, we prove that for both kinds of algorithms, the second moments of the nodes' states are uniformly bounded. Especially, for the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm, we transform the convergence analysis into the asymptotic property of coupled nonlinear differential inequalities with time-varying coefficients and develop a decoupling method. For both kinds of algorithms, we show that by choosing the time-varying algorithm gains properly, all nodes' states achieve $\mathcal{L}^{\infty}$-consensus for a connected graphon. Furthermore, if the local cost functions are strongly convex, then all nodes' states converge to the minimizer of the global cost function and the auxiliary states in the stochastic gradient tracking algorithm converge to the gradient value of the global cost function at the minimizer uniformly in mean square.</description>

Abstract: While control barrier functions (CBFs) are employed in addressing safety, control synthesis methods based on them generally rely on accurate system dynamics. This is a critical limitation, since the dynamics of complex systems are often not fully known. Supervised machine learning techniques hold great promise for alleviating this weakness by inferring models from data. We propose a novel \revision{approach for safe event-triggered learning of Gaussian process models in CBF-based continuous-time control for unknown control-affine systems. By applying a finite excitation at triggering times, our approach ensures a sufficient information gain to maintain the feasibility of the CBF-based safety condition with high probability. Our approach probabilistically guarantees safety based on a suitable GP prior and rules out} Zeno behavior in the triggering scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and theory is demonstrated in simulations.</description>

      <title>Almost Sure Convergence of Networked Policy Gradient over Time-Varying Networks in Markov Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose networked policy gradient play for solving Markov potential games with continuous and/or discrete state-action pairs. During the game, agents use parametrized and differentiable policies that depend on the current state and the policy parameters of other agents. During training, agents update their policy parameters following stochastic gradients. The gradient estimation involves two consecutive episodes, generating unbiased estimators of reward and policy score functions. In addition, it involves keeping estimates of others' parameters using consensus steps given local estimates received through a time-varying communication network. In Markov potential games, there exists a potential value function among agents with gradients corresponding to the gradients of local value functions. Using this structure, we prove almost sure convergence to a stationary point of the potential value function with rate $O(1/\epsilon^2)$. Compared to previous works, our results do not require bounded policy gradients or initial agreement on the values of individual policy parameters. Numerical experiments on a dynamic multi-agent newsvendor problem verify the convergence of local beliefs and gradients. It further shows that networked policy gradient play converges as fast as independent policy gradient updates, while collecting higher rewards.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Model Predictive Control to a Weighted Coverage Path Planning Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to a weighted coverage path planning (WCPP) problem. The problem appears in a wide range of practical applications, including search and rescue (SAR) missions. The basic setup is that one (or multiple) agents can move around a given search space and collect rewards from a given spatial distribution. Unlike an artificial potential field, each reward can only be collected once. In contrast to a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), the agent moves in a continuous space. Moreover, he is not obliged to cover all locations and/or may return to previously visited locations. The WCPP problem is tackled by a new Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulation with so-called Coverage Constraints (CCs). It is shown that the solution becomes more effective if the solver is initialized with a TSP-based heuristic. With and without this initialization, the proposed MPC approach clearly outperforms a naive MPC formulation, as demonstrated in a small simulation study.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Bayesian Approach for System Identification based on Linear Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a practical and computationally tractable methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information of the model with respect to the parameters. Our approach consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and use a linear Gaussian model approximation to iteratively optimize the model's parameters. In each iteration, we propose to use the input-output data to tune the covariance of the linear Gaussian model. This online covariance calibration stabilizes fitting and signals model inaccuracy. Secondly, we define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. We test our method with linear and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Coordinated Routing Approach for Enhancing Bus Timeliness and Travel Efficiency in Mixed-Traffic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated routing strategy aimed at improving bus schedule adherence and enhancing travel efficiency for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) operating within a mixed-traffic urban network. Our approach capitalizes on the existence of dedicated lanes for buses and CAVs, leveraging real-time traffic data to dynamically reroute CAVs in anticipation of congestion. By continuously monitoring traffic conditions on dedicated lanes and tracking the real-time positions of buses, we enable the system to proactively adjust CAV routes when potential interference with bus operations is detected. This coordination mitigates delays affecting transit services and reduces travel time for CAVs. We evaluate the proposed strategy through simulation studies conducted in the SUMO. The results demonstrate significant improvements in both transit reliability and CAV operational performance across a range of traffic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Demand charge often constitutes a significant portion of electricity costs for commercial electric vehicle (EV) charging station operators. This paper explores control methods to reduce peak power consumption at workplace EV charging stations in a joint price and power optimization framework. We optimize a menu of price options to incentivize users to select controllable charging service. Using this framework, we propose a model predictive control approach to reduce both demand charge and overall operator costs. Through a Monte Carlo simulation, we find that our algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art benchmark optimization strategy and can significantly reduce station operator costs.</description>

      <title>Transient Stability Analysis of a Hybrid Grid-Forming and Grid-Following RES System Considering Multi-Mode Control Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent control switching of renewable energy sources (RESs) during intricate transient processes introduces complexity to the dynamic behavior of modern power systems. This paper reveals the dynamic coupling between grid-forming (GFM)/grid-following (GFL)-based RES and dominant instability modes of the hybrid system. First, six control combinations are systematically investigated by pairing the two GFM-RES modes, normal control (NC) and current saturation (CS), with the three GFL-RES modes: normal control, low voltage ride-through (LVRT), and high voltage ride-through (HVRT). Based on switching system theory, the coupled power flow and dynamic motion models are developed considering multi-mode switching characteristics. It is revealed that the hybrid system exhibits two distinct instability modes when the GFM-RES and GFL-RES exceed their P-f and V-f desynchronization boundaries, respectively. The two-dimensional spatiotemporal damping characteristics of GFL-RES induced by GFM-RES are also uncovered for the first time. A novel criterion is proposed to quantify the impact of GFM-RES on GFL-RES dynamics, capturing both its stabilizing and destabilizing effects under different control combinations. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations validate the correctness of the analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Guided Policy Search for Non-Cooperative Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives. However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training. Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more stable learning than existing MARL methods.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Control via Sparsity-Promoting Regularization: A Rollout Approach with Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a controller design framework aiming to balance control performance and actuation rate. Control performance is evaluated by an infinite-horizon average cost, and the number of control actions is penalized via sparsity-promoting regularization. Since the formulated optimal control problem has a combinatorial nature, we employ a rollout algorithm to obtain a tractable suboptimal solution. In the proposed scheme, actuation timings are determined through a multistage minimization procedure based on a receding-horizon approach, and the corresponding control inputs are computed online. We establish theoretical performance guarantees with respect to periodic control and prove the stability of the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identification of continuous-time vector fields from irregularly sampled trajectories. We introduce Spectral Flow Learning (SFL), which learns in a windowed flow space using a lag-linear label operator that aggregates lagged Koopman actions. We provide finite-sample high-probability (FS-HP) guarantees for the class of variable-step linear multistep methods (vLLM). The FS-HP rates are constructed using spectral regularization with qualification-controlled filters for flow predictors under standard source and filter assumptions. A multistep observability inequality links flow error to vector-field error and yields two-term bounds that combine a statistical rate with an explicit discretization bias from vLMM theory.
  This preliminary preprint states the results and sketches proofs, with full proofs and extensions deferred to a journal version.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation in a Markovian Framework Revisited: Lipschitz Continuity of the Poisson Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09464</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.09464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit a fundamental technical issue within the theory of stochastic approximation (SA) in a Markovian framework, first proposed in the book by Djereveckii and Fradkov (1981), and further developed in much detail in the book by Benveniste, M{\'e}tivier, and Priouret (1990). This theory is instrumental in many application areas such as the statistical analysis of Hidden Markov Models arising in telecommunication, quantized linear stochastic systems, and more recently in active learning and reinforcement learning. The problem at hand is the verification of the existence, uniqueness and Lipschitz-continuity of the solution of a parameter-dependent Poisson equation, in an appropriate weighted sup-norm, associated with a collection of Markov chains on general state spaces. Verification of the above facts is vital in the analysis of SA processes presented in (Benveniste et al., 1990) via the ODE (ordinary differential equations) method, requiring substantial technical effort. The motivation and focus of the paper is to address this technical issue, by presenting a simple set of conditions, under which the above properties of the Poisson equation at hand can be conveniently established. The starting point of our work is an intricate result of Hairer and Mattingly (2011) proving that by tilting standard conditions of mainstream stability theory for Markov chains, the transition kernels prove to be contractions in the space of differences of probability measures in a suitable metric. To demonstrate the applicability of our results, the proposed conditions are verified for a class of queuing system with open-loop control.</description>

      <title>Learning linear dynamical systems under convex constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15121v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finite-time identification of linear dynamical systems from $T$ samples of a single trajectory. Recent results have predominantly focused on the setup where either no structural assumption is made on the system matrix $A^* \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, or specific structural assumptions (e.g. sparsity) are made on $A^*$. We assume prior structural information on $A^*$ is available, which can be captured in the form of a convex set $\mathcal{K}$ containing $A^*$. For the solution of the ensuing constrained least squares estimator, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds in the Frobenius norm that depend on the local size of $\mathcal{K}$ at $A^*$. To illustrate the usefulness of these results, we instantiate them for four examples, namely when (i) $A^*$ is sparse and $\mathcal{K}$ is a suitably scaled $\ell_1$ ball; (ii) $\mathcal{K}$ is a subspace; (iii) $\mathcal{K}$ consists of matrices each of which is formed by sampling a bivariate convex function on a uniform $n \times n$ grid (convex regression); (iv) $\mathcal{K}$ consists of matrices each row of which is formed by uniform sampling (with step size $1/T$) of a univariate Lipschitz function. In all these situations, we show that $A^*$ can be reliably estimated for values of $T$ much smaller than what is needed for the unconstrained setting.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-based Parameter Estimation in Dynamic Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation, which represents a classical inverse problem, is often ill-posed as different parameter combinations can yield identical outputs. This non-uniqueness poses a critical barrier to accurate and unique identification. This work introduces a novel parameter estimation framework to address such limits: the Joint Conditional Diffusion Model-based Inverse Problem Solver (JCDI). By leveraging the stochasticity of diffusion models, JCDI produces possible solutions revealing underlying distributions. Joint conditioning on multiple observations further narrows the posterior distributions of non-identifiable parameters. For the challenging task in dynamic power systems: composite load model parameterization, JCDI achieves a 58.6% reduction in parameter estimation error compared to the single-condition model. It also accurately replicates system's dynamic responses under various electrical faults, with root mean square errors below 4*10^(-3), outperforming existing deep-reinforcement-learning and supervised learning approaches. Given its data-driven nature, JCDI provides a universal framework for parameter estimation while effectively mitigating the non-uniqueness challenge across scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS): Power Radiation Model and Optimal Beamforming Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) improve wireless links by configuring the locations of activated pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides, namely pinching beamforming. In this paper, a novel adjustable power radiation model is proposed for PASS, where power radiation ratios of pinching antennas can be flexibly controlled by tuning the spacing between pinching antennas and waveguides. A closed-form pinching antenna spacing arrangement strategy is derived to achieve the commonly assumed equal-power radiation. Based on this, a practical PASS framework relying on discrete activation is considered, where pinching antennas can only be activated among a set of predefined locations. A transmit power minimization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit beamforming, pinching beamforming, and the numbers of activated pinching antennas, subject to each user's minimum rate requirement. (1) To solve the resulting highly coupled mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, branch-and-bound (BnB)-based algorithms are proposed for both single-user and multi-user scenarios, which is guaranteed to converge to globally optimal solutions. (2) A low-complexity many-to-many matching algorithm is further developed. Combined with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theory, locally optimal and pairwise-stable solutions are obtained within polynomial-time complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that: (i) PASS significantly outperforms conventional multi-antenna architectures, particularly when the number of users and the spatial range increase; and (ii) The proposed matching-based algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, resulting in only a slight performance loss while significantly reducing computational overheads.

      <description>arXiv:2506.09766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An approach is proposed to identify optimal asset protection strategies based on vulnerability assessment outcomes. Traditional bilevel attacker-defender models emphasize worst-case scenarios but offer limited defensive guidance. In contrast, trilevel models introduce high computational complexity and rely on fixed network configurations. The proposed critical-components method leverages vulnerability assessment results to determine protection strategies, effectively outsourcing the upper-level defense decision. This enables adaptability to diverse network topologies, assessment techniques, and cyber-physical energy systems without the overhead of multi-level optimization. Case studies demonstrate the potential for improved system resilience across varying operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Predictor-based Risk-Aware Planning with Conformal Prediction in Dense, Uncertain Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time planning among many uncertain, dynamic obstacles is challenging because predicting every agent with high fidelity is both unnecessary and computationally expensive. We present Heterogeneous Predictor-based Risk-Aware Planning (H-PRAP), a framework that allocates prediction effort to where it matters. H-PRAP introduces the Probability-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI), a closed-form, horizon-level collision index obtained by calibrating a Gaussian surrogate with conformal prediction. P-CRI drives a router that assigns high-risk obstacles to accurate but expensive predictors and low-risk obstacles to lightweight predictors, while preserving distribution-free coverage across heterogeneous predictors through conformal prediction. The selected predictions and their conformal radii are embedded in a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) problem, yielding receding-horizon policies with explicit safety margins. We analyze the safety-efficiency trade-off under prediction compute budget: more portion of low-fidelity predictions reduce residual risk from dropped obstacles, but in the same time induces larger conformal radii and degrades trajectory efficiency and shrinks MPC feasibility. Extensive numerical simulations in dense, uncertain environments validate that H-PRAP attains best balance between trajectory success rate (i.e., no collisions) and the time to reach the goal (i.e., trajectory efficiency) compared to single prediction architectures.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for identifying and simulating financial and economic systems using stochastically structured reservoir computers (SSRCs). The framework combines structure-preserving embeddings with graph-informed coupling matrices to model inter-agent dynamics while enhancing interpretability. A constrained optimization scheme guarantees compliance with both stochastic and structural constraints. Two empirical case studies, a nonlinear stochastic dynamic model and regional inflation network dynamics, demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in capturing complex nonlinear patterns and enabling interpretable predictive analysis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>TaxSolver: A methodology to realize optimal income tax reform</title>

Abstract: Across the globe there are growing calls to streamline and improve ever more complex income tax codes. Executing reform has proven difficult. Even when the desired outcomes are clear, the tools to design fitting reforms are lacking. To remedy this, we developed \texttt{TaxSolver}: a methodology to help policymakers realize optimal tax reform. \texttt{TaxSolver} allows policymakers to focus solely on what they aim to achieve with a reform -- like redistributing wealth, incentivizing labor market participation or reducing complexity -- and the guarantees within which reform is acceptable -- like limited fluctuations in taxpayer incomes or shocks to overall tax revenue. Given these goals and fiscal guarantees, \texttt{TaxSolver} finds the optimal set of tax rules that satisfies all the criteria or shows that the set of demands are not mathematically feasible. We illustrate \texttt{TaxSolver} by reforming various simulated examples of tax codes, including some that reflect the complexity and size of a real-world tax system.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Detection of Lithium Plating in Lithium-ion Cells: A Gaussian Process Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process (GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data, (ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates (0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating detection.</description>
