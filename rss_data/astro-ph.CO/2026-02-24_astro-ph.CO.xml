      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 5. Cosmological Constraints with Simulation-Based Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the public DESI full-shape clustering data using simulation-based priors (SBPs). Our priors are obtained by fitting normalizing flows to the distribution of EFT parameters measured from field-level simulations, themselves generated using tailored halo occupation distribution (HOD) models for each tracer. Incorporating SBPs in a power spectrum analysis significantly enhances $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameter constraints; in combination with BAO information from DESI DR2 and a BBN prior on the baryon density, we find the matter density parameter $\Omega_m=0.2987\pm 0.0066$, the Hubble constant $H_0=68.80\pm 0.35\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.766\pm 0.015$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8=0.764\pm 0.018$), which are $1\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ stronger than the baseline results, though with a notable downwards shift in $\sigma_8$. The SBPs also have a significant impact in extended models, with the dark energy figure-of-merit improving by $70\%$ ($20\%$) in a $w_0w_a$CDM analysis when combining with the CMB (and supernovae). In the SBP analysis, we do not find statistically significant evidence for dynamical dark energy: the equation of state parameters are consistent with a cosmological constant within $2.2\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$) in analyses without (with) supernovae. The neutrino mass constraints are also enhanced, with the $95\%$ limits $M_\nu&lt;0.073\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.090\,\mathrm{eV}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM respectively. The latter is the strongest constraint obtained to date and reinforces the preference for the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, regardless of the background dynamics. While our results are sensitive to HOD modeling assumptions, they clearly demonstrate that the inclusion of small-scale information can significantly sharpen cosmological parameter constraints.</description>

      <title>One Halo, Two Boundaries: Relating Accretion Shocks and Splashback Radii in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundaries of dark matter and gas in clusters are delineated by the splashback radius and the accretion shock, respectively. Theoretically, both of these boundaries are expected to coincide at the outskirts of halos. However, hydrodynamic cosmological simulations have highlighted significant displacement between them. In this study, we utilise the IllustrisTNG simulation suite to investigate the statistical relationship between the splashback and shock surfaces in a sample of 812 cluster-mass halos. We compute the full angular distribution of both boundaries and examine their relationship, also considering how different moments of this distribution correlate with halo properties. We employ a dispersion-based measure for the splashback boundary and the maximum entropy distance for the shock location. Despite examining various boundary definitions, we consistently observe an offset between the splashback and shock boundaries, with $R_{\rm sh}/R_{\rm sp} \sim 1.3-2$, depending on specific methodological choices. This offset predominantly occurs along void directions. We analyse the redshift evolution of these boundaries for a subset of halos and find that splashback and shock boundaries are not necessarily distinct at earlier times. During mergers, gas dissipates energy and resists contraction via pressure, unlike collisionless dark matter, leading to the observed boundary offset. We also find that the feature in pressure profiles arising from the outer accretion shock is sensitive to the exact method of stacking, which has important implications for observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints from a joint DESI DR1 Full-Shape and DR2 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis combining full-shape (FS) clustering measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2. To achieve a robust combination that accounts for the correlation between the two data releases, we employ the ShapeFit compression method and estimate the joint covariance using EZmocks. This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain--for the first time within a Bayesian framework--reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $\Lambda$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $\Lambda$CDM, we find $\Omega_m = 0.3035 \pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \pm 0.0059$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.822 \pm 0.034$. For the $w_0 w_a$CDM dynamical dark energy model, we measure $w_0 = 0.49 \pm 0.25$ and $w_a = -1.52 \pm 0.77$, improving constraints by $\sim 30\%$ relative to the analogous DR1 measurement and reducing the discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM to $1.4\sigma$ when compared to BAO only analyses. We also report competitive limits on the sum of neutrino masses and spatial curvature. This work demonstrates that the ShapeFit compression provides a prior-robust and computationally efficient pathway to constrain beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics with large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Universe Expansion History with f(R,T) Gravity: Constraints on Cosmological Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the cosmological implications of two functional forms of $f(R,T) = R + \alpha T^n$ gravity: for two different value of $n $ where $n=1$ and $n\neq 1$, and $\alpha$ and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived, and the cosmic evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ is determined. Cosmological parameters are estimated through $\chi^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $\alpha$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $\omega$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Log-Periodic Modulation in High-Redshift Compact Object Abundance Consistent with Cyclic Condensate Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the redshift distribution of high-$z$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei identified in early JWST data, and investigate the presence of periodic structure in the variable $x=\ln(1+z)$. A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing $\Delta x \simeq 0.34$, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution.
  A periodic structure in $x$ implies a preferred scaling ratio in $(1+z)$, which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama--Morikawa--Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\ln(1+z)$.
  While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Baryogenesis in $f(R)$ Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of a baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the Universe via gravitational baryogenesis is investigated for two f(R) modified theories of gravity, the widely used Starobinsky $f(R)=R+R^{2}/M^{2}$ model, and the recently proposed power-law model $f(R)=c_{1}R^{2+k/4}+c_{2}R+c_{3}$ of Odintsov and Oikonomou (2025) that is constructed from the slow-roll inflation parameters, and fits the new high-multipole CMB observations reported by the Planck and ACT collaborations for $k \sim -0.03$. The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $\eta $ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $\eta$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $\eta$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $\eta = 8.65 \times 10^{-11}$. Since $\eta \propto (M/M_{\ast})^{2}$, reducing $M_{\ast}$ slightly from $M_{Pl}$ to $0.4 M_{Pl}$ would bring the calculated values into agreement with the observed value.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence Model: Analytical Quantification of the Fine-Tuning Problem in Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a quintessence field with an exponential potential motivated by the suggestion of time-varying dark energy from the DESI galaxy survey. Assuming a kination epoch in the early Universe, we analytically derive constraints on initial conditions that are consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the current dark energy density. Compared to the severe 120-digit fine-tuning required for dark energy to be a cosmological constant, our result suggests that the degree of fine-tuning is naturally relaxed by dozens of orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we discuss the method for testing this model through future observations of the gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>The Hydrostatic Mass Bias and the $\sigma_8$ Tension: A Multi-Probe Forecast for Stage-IV/V Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hydrostatic mass bias ($b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$) is a leading systematic uncertainty in cluster cosmology and a principal source of degeneracy with $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$. We investigate the capability of Stage-IV CMB and optical surveys to calibrate $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ using tomographic cross-correlations between the thermal Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, galaxy clustering, and weak lensing. We perform a Fisher forecast incorporating realistic survey noise, foreground modeling for clustered CIB and radio sources, and full marginalization over cosmological and astrophysical nuisance parameters, including per-bin galaxy bias perturbations, photometric redshift shifts, intrinsic alignments, and baryonic feedback modeled with HMCode2020. With optimized tomographic binning (10 lens and 5 source bins for LSST; 6 lens and 5 source bins for CSST), we forecast marginalized constraints of $0.98\%$ for SO+LSST, $1.60\%$ for CMB-S4+LSST, and $2.40\%$ for CMB-S4+CSST. Tomography improves $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ precision by factors of approximately three relative to non-tomographic analyses, reflecting the role of redshift information in breaking the $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$--$\sigma_8$ degeneracy. Optical-only probes provide no direct constraint on $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$, whereas inclusion of tSZ-containing spectra enables percent-level calibration under realistic systematic assumptions. The results demonstrate that multi-probe tomographic analyses with Stage-IV surveys can achieve robust control of hydrostatic mass bias, strengthening cluster-based constraints on structure growth.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in Rastall Gravity: Shifted Collapse Threshold and Exponential Abundance Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes formed in the early universe are compelling candidates for dark matter. We investigate their production in Rastall gravity, a modification of general relativity that introduces a non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry through the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. Analyz- ing cosmological perturbations during radiation domination, we demonstrate that the Rastall parameter fundamentally alters the collapse dynamics, modifying the growth of density fluctuations, the critical threshold for black hole formation, and the fluctuation amplitude at horizon crossing. Current cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure restrict the Rastall parameter to small values, yet within this allowed range PBH production can be altered by orders of magnitude compared to general relativity. Our results establish primordial black holes as novel probes of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings and domain walls: the impact of CMB $B$-mode data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse CMB constraints on stable networks of cosmic strings and domain walls using for the first time full Planck 2018 data together with BICEP/Keck 2018 $B$-mode measurements. The defect-induced anisotropies are computed using the Unconnected Segment Model for Nambu-Goto and Abelian-Higgs strings, as well as for stable domain walls, and included in a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis jointly varying all $\Lambda$CDM parameters, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the string/domain wall tension. No statistically significant evidence for defects is found, although we observe a mild preference for non-zero cosmic string tension. Our results improve previous constraints on the defect power spectrum by up to a factor of two. In the particular case of strings, the improvement is driven by the $B$-mode data, and is especially pronounced for Abelian-Higgs strings. We also present forecasts for upcoming Simons Observatory data and find that, with the baseline noise configuration, the constraints on the string tension could improve by about a factor of three. Finally, we assess the impact of Nambu-Goto string loops on CMB anisotropies in light of both current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in Zwicky's Cosmology: Towards an Epistemological Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new contextualised reading of Fritz Zwicky's 1933 article ''The redshift of extragalactic nebulae'' about the virial analysis of the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma cluster leads to a reconsideration of the traditional discourse on the introduction of dark matter. We argue that this component of matter was not only already on the stage of the scientific debates of the time, but also, in a more concealed form, played a central role in Zwicky's epistemic context. We thus reject the narration that dark matter is the result of a ``na{\"i}ve'' astrophysical observation and emphasise the cosmological motivations that prompted Zwicky to presciently search for it. Moreover, with regard to its abundance, we argue that the discrepancy between the observed amount of luminous matter in the Coma Cluster and Zwicky's higher mass estimate derived from virial analysis was not, in fact, astonishing. What Zwicky described as a surprising excess of dark matter was of precisely the order of magnitude he had set out to identify. Consequently, we challenge the widespread view that dark matter was merely an ad hoc hypothesis introduced to rescue Newtonian theory. Instead, we suggest it may represent one of the earliest cosmological indications supporting a new emerging theory of gravitation: General Relativity. This reinterpretation contributes to ongoing debates in the philosophy of science concerning the epistemic status of ad hoc hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Long-Lived Particles Using Dimension-Six Effective Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) provide an interesting window into physics beyond the Standard Model, offering characteristic signatures at colliders and in cosmology. In this work, we investigate LLPs decays into dark matter. If the lifetime of LLPs are longer than $10^4$s, the decay products can disrupt the synthesis of light nuclei in the early universe and alter Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions. If the LLP is much heavier than the dark matter particle, the decay contributes to the number of effective neutrino species, $N_{eff}$. We describe these decays via dimension-six effective operators and outline the parameter space in which such decays obey cosmological bounds stemming from BBN, structure formation, Cosmic Microwave Background, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data.</description>

      <title>Scaling solutions for varying tension strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Velocity-dependent One Scale Model for topological defect evolution to explore and classify the possible scaling solutions for string networks with time-varying tension, in cosmological and non-cosmological settings and under two different phenomenological assumptions for the behavior of these variations, which rely on different stretching and damping contributions to the string dynamics. We discuss how these assumptions impact the standard scaling solutions, as well as the evolution of the string network density. In addition to simple power-law cosmological epochs solutions, we also discuss the behavior of the network during the radiation-to-matter and matter-to-acceleration transitions. Overall, our results show that for the same amount of tension variation, a change in the stretching length scale tends to have a more significant impact on the network than a change in the damping length.</description>

      <title>Dark Glueball Direct Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider glueball dark matter (DM) in a Yang-Mills dark sector confined at $\Lambda_D$ scale and coupled to the Standard Model through electrically and dark-color charged vector-like fermion portals, with the mass scale $m_\psi$. In a simple case with two lightest mass-degenerate vector-like fermions with opposite electric charges the effective amplitudes with one $C$-odd glueball (oddball) and odd number of photons vanish, rendering the lightest $C$-odd spin-1 state with mass $m_\chi$ a viable DM candidate provided that $m_\psi\gtrsim 5.5 \Lambda_D$. We develop a controlled effective field theory framework with non-perturbative information supported by QCD phenomenology leading to a quantitative prediction for coherent elastic glueball scattering off nuclei. We find a steep scaling of the spin-independent cross section $\sigma_{\rm SI}\propto \Lambda_D^{2.15} m_\psi^{-8}$. This implies that the sensitivity of the current and next-generation xenon experiments in the range of $\sigma_{\rm SI} \sim 10^{-46} - 10^{-48}$ cm$^2$ corresponds to $m_\psi \simeq 3-30$ GeV, respectively, for $\Lambda_D\simeq 0.55-5.5$ GeV. We provide a minimal UV completion of the portal sector compatible with collider phenomenology. Our results pave a quantitative foundation for testing glueball DM in direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation Limits in Blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter degeneracy in blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is known but rarely quantified. This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $\delta$, $B$, $p$, $\gamma_{\rm min}$ and $\gamma_{\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $\delta$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $\delta$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $\delta$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars.</description>

      <title>BayeSED-GALAXIES II. Bayesian full spectrum analysis of galaxies and application in the CSST wide-field slitless spectroscopy survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct wide-field multiband photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys, advancing cosmology and galaxy evolution studies. Achieving CSST's cosmological goals requires precise redshifts ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\lesssim 0.002-0.005$) from low-resolution ($R\sim200$) and potentially blended slitless spectra. We present BayeSED3, extended for Bayesian full-spectrum analysis, including nebular emission modeling (via \textsc{Cloudy}) and a Bayesian treatment of the model scaling factor, improving reliability over optimization methods for low SNR spectra. Validated on realistic mock data generated with the CESS emulator (median SNR=1.65, including instrumental and self-blending effects), our method achieves excellent redshift precision with three-band (GU+GV+GI) spectroscopy: $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.0008$ ($\sim$80% success) for star-forming and $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}=0.0015$ ($\sim$50% success) for quiescent galaxies. Stellar mass ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.015$ dex for SF, $\approx0.016$ dex for quiescent) and SFR ($\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\approx0.05$ dex for SF, especially at SNR&gt;1) are reliably recovered. Self-blending increases scatter by $\gtrsim30%$, but combining spectroscopy with CSST's seven-band photometry significantly improves accuracy, especially for quiescent galaxies and data-limited cases. Single-band spectroscopy plus photometry yields reasonable redshifts: GU+photometry is limited, GI+photometry gives &gt;60% (SF) and &gt;40% (quiescent) success at $\sigma_{\rm NMAD}\lesssim0.002$, GV+photometry gives &gt;35% (SF) and $\sim$40% (quiescent) at similar precision. The Bayesian framework offers a powerful method for accurate galaxy characterization, enhancing CSST's scientific outcomes despite the challenges of slitless spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Chaotic imprints of dark matter in extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the most powerful probes of strong-field gravity and of the environments surrounding supermassive compact objects. Motivated by the expected presence of dark matter near galactic centers, we investigate the emergence and gravitational-wave imprints of chaotic dynamics in EMRIs evolving in non-vacuum spacetimes. Within a unified dynamical framework, we analyze test-particle motion in a broad class of dark-matter-embedded geometries, including singular black holes, regular black holes, naked singularities, and Einstein-cluster configurations. We show that environmental perturbations generically break integrability in the strong-field regime, giving rise to chaotic motion whose onset, duration, and termination depend sensitively on horizon structure, core regularization, and matter distribution. Using the numerical Kludge approach, we demonstrate that chaotic trajectories produce systematic qualitative modifications of the emitted gravitational radiation, such as irregular amplitude modulation and loss of phase coherence, in contrast to the smooth, quasi-periodic waveforms generated by regular motion. Our results establish the robustness of chaos in environmentally perturbed EMRIs and provide a clear conceptual link between nonlinear orbital dynamics, spacetime structure, and observable gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>MEDUSA I. Tracing magnetic field structures in tidal arms of the dwarf-dwarf merger NGC 1487</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are important laboratories for studying cosmic magnetism because they can maintain strong magnetic fields via the action of turbulent dynamo despite their low mass and weak gravitational potential. The Magnetic-field Evolution in Dwarf galaxies from Ultra-deep SKA Analysis (MEDUSA) survey is the first SKA-pathfinder programme designed to obtain deep continuum, polarisation, and HI data for dwarf galaxies, enabling a comprehensive study of their radio spectra, magnetic fields, and gas kinematics across a representative population. By analysing the radio continuum spectra and polarisation of the dwarf-dwarf galaxy merger NGC 1487 from the MEDUSA sample, we aim to determine its magnetic field strength and to characterise the large-scale and turbulent components of its magnetic field. We utilise highly sensitive multi-band radio continuum data from MeerKAT L-band (1.28 GHz) and Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) L/S (2.1 GHz), C (5.5 GHz), and X-bands (9 GHz). We analysed the magnetic field configuration using polarisation and rotation measure (RM) synthesis. The integrated spectral energy distribution has a non-thermal spectral index of $\alpha_{\rm nth} = -0.678\pm0.085$. Synchrotron and inverse Compton losses cause a spectral break at $\nu_{\rm b} = 6.2\pm1.3$ GHz. In star-forming regions, the magnetic field exhibits strong small-scale fluctuations in RM, suggesting the action of a small-scale dynamo. Conversely, the field becomes more ordered, aligning with the tidal arms toward the galaxy's outskirts, showing a large-scale magnetic field over $\approx3$ kpc. Observations of the dwarf-dwarf merger NGC 1487 show that even low-mass galaxy mergers, likely the building blocks of larger galaxies in the early Universe, can rapidly amplify and produce coherent large-scale magnetic field structures, highlighting their key contribution in the early magnetisation of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic scalar dark matter in U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$: Evading direct detection and prospective neutron star heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptophilic dark matter (DM) is a well-motivated thermal WIMP framework that can evade stringent nuclear-recoil searches while remaining testable via DM-induced heating of neutron stars (NS). In this work, we study leptophilic scalar DM in a $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, which provides a common leptophilic portal for all scenarios considered. To reproduce the observed relic abundance while suppressing direct-detection signals, we investigate three benchmark realizations: (i) a secluded DM scenario in which the relic density is set by annihilation into $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge bosons, and two pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM models based on (ii) an SO(4) symmetry and (iii) an SO(3) symmetry. In the SO(4) pNGB model, the DM mass arises at tree level from a soft breaking term, while the elastic scattering amplitude is suppressed by a symmetry-protected cancellation. In the SO(3) pNGB model, the DM mass is generated radiatively at one loop via the $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge interaction, and we show that this gauging preserves the same cancellation mechanism, maintaining compatibility with direct-detection null results. We perform a systematic parameter scan imposing relic density, direct- and indirect-detection, and neutrino trident constraints, and identify viable sub-TeV to TeV DM candidates. Assuming maximal capture in NSs, we find that the remaining parameter space can be tested by near-infrared observations of NSs, providing sensitivity complementary to terrestrial searches in regions that are currently weakly constrained.</description>

      <title>Addressing leakage and mode suppression in angular power spectrum estimation for gravitational-wave backgrounds using pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mapping gravitational-wave background (GWB) anisotropy with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is affected by harmonic-space mode suppression and mode coupling arising from an array's nonuniform sky response. Spherical harmonic expansions must be truncated at finite multipole l_max^rec, often set to l_max^N_pair$\equiv {\rm int}\left[\sqrt{\text{N_pair}}-1\right]$, where N_pair is the number of distinct pulsar pairs in an array. This choice is motivated by the counting argument that cross-correlations provide at most N_pair independent constraints. We obtain the multipole l_max^res corresponding to the maximum informative angular scale of a PTA. It is defined such that expansions to l_max^res (approximately) span the space of "observable skies" encoded in the N_pair eigenmaps of the Fisher information matrix, and therefore depends on the array configuration. We explicitly show that GWB power contained in multipoles l$\gtrsim$l_max^res do not significantly affect analyses that use expansions out to l_max^res, because the PTA response acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, truncating at l_max^rec&lt; l_max^res leads to leakage of small-scale angular power from l_max^rec&lt;l$\leq$l_max^res. Even choosing l_max^rec=l_max^res, the standard frequentist estimator of the angular power spectrum C_l remains biased by the modes unobservable by the array. Although we can (partially) debias the standard estimator -- improving its agreement with an injected spectrum -- this reduction in bias comes at the expense of an increase in variance, particularly for poorly constrained modes with l$\gg$l_eff. We therefore recommend: (i) using l_max^res for PTA analyses involving spherical harmonic expansions, and (ii) using the debiased standard estimator for C_l recovery, but only out to multipoles l&lt;l_eff ($\ll$l_max^res) corresponding to sufficiently constrained modes.</description>

      <title>Prompt And Delayed Radio Bangs At Kilohertz By SN 1987A: A Test For Graviton-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9604047</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9604047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   A sequence of prompt and delayed radio signals at tens of kilohertz should reach the Earth (or Jupiter) due to graviton--photon conversion in interstellar as well as local planetary magnetic fields. These radio fluxes may be a detectable probe of a huge gravitational burst expected from Supernovae explosions. The earliest prompt radio signal, coinciding with the neutrino burst, is due to conversion in the terrestrial (or Jovian) magnetic field and is below the micro-Jansky (or milli-Jansky) level for a galactic Supernova like SN1987A. A later radio signal, a ``tail'', due to the same graviton - radio wave conversion in random interstellar fields will maintain a relic radio ``noise'' for hundreds or thousands of years and might even be still detectable by a very sensitive network of satellite antennas at the kilohertz band. Exact solutions are presented here for the graviton-photon conversion in a refractive medium, as well as their consequences for high energy supernovae and the 2.726 K background radiation.</description>

Abstract: The first version of these lecture notes is based on the hand-written notes I prepared for the cosmology course taught to graduate students of PPGFis and PPGCosmo at the Federal University of Esp\'irito Santo (UFES), starting in 2014. The course covers topics ranging from the evidence for the expanding universe to the anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background. The notes are also available on my personal webpage (https://www.oliverfpiattella.eu) and have been published by Springer. The second version extends and updates the material presented in the first version, and typographical errors and mistakes have also been corrected.</description>

Abstract: The general theory of relativity (GR) has excelled in explaining gravitational phenomena at the scale of the solar system with remarkable precision. However, when extended to the galactic or cosmological scale, it requires dark matter and dark energy to explain observations. In our previous article (arXiv:2308.04503), we've formulated a gravity theory based in Mach's principle, known as Machian gravity. We demonstrated that the theory successfully explains galactic velocity profiles without requiring additional dark matter components. In previous studies, for a selected set of galaxy clusters, we also showed its ability to explain the velocity dispersion in the clusters without extra unseen matter components. This paper primarily explores the mass profiles of galaxy clusters. We test the Machian Gravity acceleration law on two distinct sets comprising galaxy clusters sourced from various studies. We fitted the dynamic mass profiles using the Machian gravity model. The outcomes of our study show good agreement between the theory and observational results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers. In the DE sector, we exploit the EFT of vector-tensor theories with the presence of a preferred time direction on the cosmological background. This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions. We also compute the effective DM gravitational coupling $G_{\rm eff}$ by using a quasi-static approximation for perturbations deep inside the DE sound horizon and show that the existence of momentum and energy transfers allow a possibility to realize $G_{\rm eff}$ smaller than in the uncoupled case at low redshift.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic alignments of galaxies in multiple projections</title>

Abstract: Intrinsic alignments of galaxies are measured and modelled to gain cosmological information, to further understand the interactions between galaxies and to mitigate their effects on gravitational weak lensing studies. Hydrodynamical simulations are often used to constrain priors or calibrate models. Therefore, obtaining the maximum amount of information possible from these simulations is imperative. In this work, we have combined the information of shapes projected over two or three axes ($x,y,z$), for intrinsic alignment signals ($w_{g+},\ \tilde{\xi}_{g+,2}$), showing a consistent gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all cases studied using TNG300-1. The gain in SNR is found to be higher for the addition of the second projection than for the third, and higher for shapes calculated using the reduced inertia tensor rather than the simple one. The two shape samples studied, $n_\star&gt;300$ and $\mathrm{log}(M_\star \ h/\mathrm{M_\odot})&gt;10.5$, where the latter has a much higher signal amplitude, show similar gains in SNR when more projections are added. We also model the correlation functions with the non-linear alignment model. The SNR gains from the measurements are higher but consistent with the constraints on the non-linear alignment amplitude $A_{\rm IA}$ and galaxy bias $b_{\rm g}$. Using multiple projection axes increases SNR overall, enabling more efficient use of numerically expensive hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space for a large class of ultra-slow-roll (USR) models. This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and the Einstein Telescope. However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter. To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of the models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to efficiently scan over the viable configurations. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Joint Observation of the CSST Shear and clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave source measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive forecast for cosmological constraints using the joint observation of the cosmic shear signal from the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) and the clustering signal from the next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detector networks, e.g. Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST's weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\%-5\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.</description>

      <title>Constraining and Comparing the Dynamical Dark Energy and f(R) Modified Gravity Models with Cosmological Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain and compare the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM dynamical dark energy model and three $f(R)$ modified gravity models using the current cosmological distance measurements, including 112 high-quality localized FRBs, BAO measurements from the DESI-DR2 and the BOSS-DR12, Type~Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) from the PantheonPlus compilation and the DESY5 sample, cosmic chronometers (CC), and the angular scale of the first acoustic peak of the CMB from Planck~2018. These datasets allow us to effectively break parameter degeneracy, obtain stringent cosmological constraint results, and conduct systematic model comparison and selection. By using the FRB+PantheonPlus+DESI+CC+CMB dataset, we constrain the parameters of the dark energy equation of state in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, obtaining $w_{0} = -0.867 \pm 0.060$ and $w_{a} = -0.35^{+0.29}_{-0.25}$. For the $f(R)$ modified gravity models, the deviation parameter $b$, which characterizes departure from general relativity, is constrained to be $b = 0.206 \pm 0.084$, $b = 0.700^{+0.190}_{-0.130}$, and $b = 0.198 \pm 0.081$ for Hu-Sawicki, Starobinsky, and ArcTanh models, respectively. Besides, we compare the impacts of different SNe Ia datasets (PantheonPlus and DESY5) and BAO datasets (DESI-DR2 and BOSS-DR12) on the constraints of the cosmological models. By employing Bayesian evidence and other model selection criteria, we find that the choice of SNe Ia and BAO datasets can significantly influence the inferred preference for cosmological models. Specifically, the DESY5 and DESI datasets tend to favor $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $f(R)$ models, whereas the PantheonPlus and BOSS datasets show a comparatively stronger preference for the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</description>

      <title>Probing Dynamical Dark Energy with Late-Time Data: Evidence, Tensions, and the Limits of the $w_0w_a$CDM Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the dynamical dark-energy $w_0w_a$CDM (CPL) framework against $\Lambda$CDM using CMB anisotropies and lensing together with late-time distance probes: DESI DR2 BAO, the completed SDSS-IV BAO consensus compilation, a transverse/angular BAO compilation (BAOtr), and the Cepheid-calibrated PantheonPlus SN~Ia likelihood (PP\&amp;SH0ES). We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,\Omega_{\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0&lt;-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP\&amp;SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1&lt;q_0\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\to\infty)=w_0+w_a&lt;-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP\&amp;SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $\Lambda$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations.</description>

      <title>Status of the $S_8$ Tension: A 2026 Review of Probe Discrepancies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ quantifies the amplitude of matter density fluctuations. A persistent discrepancy exists between early-universe CMB observations and late-universe probes. This review assesses the ``$S_8$ tension'' against a new 2026 baseline: a unified ``Combined CMB'' framework incorporating Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G. This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone. Compiling measurements from 2019--2026, we reveal a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 results exhibit a statistically significant tension of $2.4\sigma$--$2.7\sigma$ in $S_8$ \citep{DESY6}, whereas KiDS Legacy results demonstrate statistical consistency at $&lt;1\sigma$ \citep{Wright2025}. We examine systematic origins of this dichotomy, including photometric redshift calibration, intrinsic alignment modeling, and shear measurement pipelines. We further contextualize these findings with cluster counts (where eROSITA favors high values while SPT favors low), galaxy-galaxy lensing, and redshift-space distortions. The heterogeneous landscape suggests survey-specific systematic effects contribute substantially to observed discrepancies, though new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM cannot be excluded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe. We argue that this changes in presence of realistic and potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We compute the resulting energy density of Weyl fermions at 1-loop using in--in formalism. If the initially massless fermions eventually acquire mass, this mechanism can explain the dark matter abundance in the Universe. Remarkably, it may be more efficient than conventional gravitational production of superheavy fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal interactions are ubiquitous in the cosmos, driving systems toward equilibrium. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermal states across the early universe, encompassing the inflationary, radiation-dominated (RD), and matter-dominated (MD) eras, through the lens of Krylov complexity. Utilizing a purification scheme, we map the thermal state to a two-mode pure state, facilitating an open-system analysis of Krylov complexity in contrast to closed-system methodologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that Krylov complexity grows exponentially during inflation, indicating chaotic behavior, before saturating at nearly constant values in the RD and MD eras due to particle production via preheating. Furthermore, we analyze the Krylov entropy, which exhibits an evolutionary trend analogous to that of complexity. Crucially, our analysis reveals a dynamical transition in the universe's dissipative nature: with the universe acting as a strongly dissipative system during inflation and transitioning to a weakly dissipative regime in the subsequent eras. These findings provide a novel quantum information perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of subsonic turbulence with smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has traditionally been hampered by zeroth-order (E0) errors, inaccurate gradient evaluations, and excessive numerical dissipation. We demonstrate that the recently developed SPH-EXA code can overcome these challenges, producing results similar to those of other state-of-the-art non-SPH codes, such as AREPO and GIZMO. We show that SPH-EXA accurately reproduces the Kolmogorov inertial range scaling in the subsonic regime with increasing resolution, closely matching state-of-the-art non-SPH methods. This is an outstanding result given the important role of SPH codes in astrophysics and cosmology, and the ubiquity of turbulent phenomena.</description>

      <title>Stamps of state on structure: Probing the state of ultralight dark matter via its density fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) candidates with very small masses, and correspondingly large number densities, have gained significant interest in recent years. These DM candidates are typically said to behave "classically". More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.</description>

Abstract: Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime. As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</description>

      <title>From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing gravity theories with networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors. We consider four distinct data-reconstruction schemes for the co-inclination and anti-inclination orbital configurations of the LISA-Taiji network. We find that the co-inclination configuration offers its advantages over the anti-inclination one and can achieve signal-to-noise ratios up to 17.3 for the vector modes and 10.4 for the scalar modes with the energy density spectrum as $\Omega_{GW}^p(f)=10^{-12}$. Our method can be used to measure beyond-general-relativity polarization modes of SGWBs at mHz frequency band, opening a new avenue for testing alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Perturbative Dynamics of a Light QCD Axion: Dark Matter and the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considerable theoretical efforts have gone into expanding the reach of the QCD axion beyond its canonical mass--decay-constant relation. The $Z_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by invoking a discrete $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is coupled to $\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\mathcal{N}$ potential has a minimum at misalignment angle $\theta=\pi$. At $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta =\pi$ becomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and develops $\mathcal{N}$ minima -- only one of which actually solves the strong CP problem. Before $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta$ relaxes towards $\pi$. After $T_{\rm QCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a field evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the hilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and backreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic density of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first lattice simulations of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and find nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two. We furthermore find that the probability of solving the strong CP problem tends to diverge considerably from the naive expectation of $1/\mathcal{N}$.</description>

      <title>The COLIBRE project: cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 100, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>Constraining a de Broglie--Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected. Gamma-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) offers the opportunity to indirectly probe such an intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), as gamma rays interact with cosmic radiation fields, producing electron-positron pairs, and initiate an electromagnetic cascade. The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc. Our results are comparable to limits obtained from blazar observations but do not suffer from assumptions on the duty cycle of the gamma-ray source or whether inverse-Compton scattering losses dominate over the development of plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>Skykatana: a scalable framework to construct sky masks for the Vera Rubin Observatory and large astronomical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern wide-field surveys require robust spatial masks to excise bright-star halos, bleed trails, poor-quality regions, and user-defined geometry at scale. We present Skykatana, an open source pipeline that builds and combines boolean HEALPix/HEALSparse maps into science-ready masks and engineered for low-memory operation. Skykatana can efficiently construct, visualize multi-order coverage maps and generate random points in high-resolution masks over half of the celestial sphere with very limited resources and leveraging the hierarchical partition of data the HATS/LSDB framework. We demonstrate two end-to-end applications: (1) a Subaru HSC-WISE composite mask; and (2) Rubin star masks generated on demand in the Rubin Science Platform by querying HATS/LSDB Gaia data and assigning radii from empirical fits to Rubin DP1 data. We release full bright-star masks for various regions of the Rubin footprint and describe performance and scaling. The code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at https://github.com/samotracio/skykatana, and the LSST masks can be obtained from https://osf.io/r5vw6</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</description>

      <title>When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as Globular Clusters in Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($&gt;10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.</description>
