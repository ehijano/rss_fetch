      <title>Excess-continuous prox-regular sweeping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Moreau's sweeping processes driven by a time dependent prox-regular set $C(t)$ which is continuous in time with respect to the asymmetric distance $e$ called the excess, defined by $e(A,B) := \sup_{x \in A} d(x,B)$ for every pair of sets $A$, $B$ in a Hilbert space. As observed by J.J. Moreau in his pioneering works, the excess provides the natural topological framework for sweeping process. Assuming a uniform interior cone condition for $C(t)$, we prove that the associated sweeping process has a unique solution, thereby improving the existing result on continuous prox-regular sweeping processes in two directions: indeed, in the previous literature $C(t)$ was supposed to be continuous in time with respect to the symmetric Hausdorff distance instead of the excess and also its boundary $\partial C(t)$ was required to be continuous in time, an assumption which we completely drop. Therefore our result allows to consider a much wider class of continuously moving constraints.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Hermite Polynomials and Calogero-Moser Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two equivalent descriptions of George Wilson's adelic Grassmannian $Gr^{ad}$, one in terms of differential ``conditions'' and another in terms of Calogero-Moser Pairs. The former approach was used in the 2020 paper by Kasman-Milson which found that each family of Exceptional Hermite Polynomials has a generating function which lives in $Gr^{ad}$. This suggests that Calogero-Moser Pairs should also be useful in the study of Exceptional Hermite Polynomials, but no researchers have pursued that line of inquiry prior to the first author's thesis. The purpose of this note is to summarize highlights from that thesis, including a novel formula for Exceptional Hermite Polynomials in terms of Calogero-Moser Pairs and a theorem utilizing this correspondence to produce explicit finitely-supported distributions which annihilate them.</description>

      <title>Sharp local smoothing estimates for curve averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp local smoothing estimates for curve averages in all dimensions. As a corollary, we prove the sharp $L^p$ boundedness of the helical maximal operator in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which was previously known only for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. We also improve previously known results in higher dimensions. There are new ingredients in the proof: Fourier decay estimates and wave envelope estimates for nondegenerate curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As a byproduct, we prove Bochner-Riesz estimates for nondegenerate curves in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Moment generating functions and moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Aistleitner, Gantert, Kabluchko, Prochno and Ramanan studied large deviation principles (LDPs) for lacunary trigonometric sums $\sum_{n=1}^N \cos(2 \pi n_k x)$, where the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ satisfies the Hadamard gap condition $n_{k+1} / n_k \geq q &gt; 1$ for $k \geq 1$. A crucial ingredient in their work were asymptotic estimates for the moment generating function (MGF) of such sums, which turned out to depend on the fine arithmetic structure of the sequence $(n_k)_{k \geq 1}$ in an intricate way. In the present paper we carry out a detailed study of the MGF for lacunary trigonometric sums (without any structural assumptions on the underlying sequence, other than lacunarity), and we determine the sharp threshold where arithmetic effects start to play a role. As an application, we prove moderate deviation principles for lacunary trigonometric sums, and show that the tail probabilities are in accordance with Gaussian behavior throughout the whole range between the central limit theorem and the LDP regime.</description>

      <title>Square-Root Cancellation, Averages over Hyperplanes, and the Structure of Finite Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a form of square-root cancellation for the operator which sums a mean-zero function over a hyperplane in $R^d$ for $R$ a possibly noncommutative finite ring. Using an argument of Hart, Iosevich, Koh, and Rudnev, we show that this square-root cancellation occurs when $R$ is a finite field. We then show that this square-root cancellation does not occur over finite rings which are not finite fields. This extends an earlier result of the author to an operator which is not translation-invariant.</description>
