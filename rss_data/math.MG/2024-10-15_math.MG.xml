      <title>Antipodality of spherical designs with odd harmonic indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the smallest size of a non-antipodal spherical design with harmonic indices $\{1,3,\dots,2m-1\}$ to be $2m+1$, where $m$ is a positive integer. This is achieved by proving an analogous result for interval designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare ambient and outer Lipschitz geometry of Lipschitz normally embedded H\"older triangles in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In contrast to the case of $\mathbb{R}^3$ there are infinitely many equivalence classes. The equivalence classes are related to the so-called microknots.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension, diverging Schottky representations and the infinite dimensional hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of our main goals in this paper is to understand the behavior of limit sets of a diverging sequence of Schottky groups in the group of isometries of the N-dimensional hyperbolic space. This leads us to a generalization of a classical theorem of Bowen on variations of Hausdorff dimension of limit sets; and to a method of transforming a diverging sequence of Schottky groups into an almost converging sequence in the group of isometries of the infinite dimensional hyperbolic space. Our results apply in particular to an example of McMullen and generalize a previous work by Mehmeti and Dang.</description>

      <title>Intersections of Poisson k-flats in hyperbolic space: completing the picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years there has been a lot of interest in the study of isometry invariant Poisson processes of $k$-flats in $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$, for $0\le k\le d-1$. A phenomenon that has no counterpart in euclidean geometry arises in the investigation of the total $k$-dimensional volume $F_r$ of the process inside a spherical observation window $B_r$ of radius $r$ when one lets $r$ tend to infinity. While $F_r$ is asymptotically normally distributed for $2k\leq d+1$, it has been shown to obey a nonstandard central limit theorem for $2k&gt;d+1$.
  The intersection process of order $m$, for $d-m(d-k) \geq 0$, of the original process $\eta$ consists of all intersections of distinct flats $E_1,\ldots,E_m \in \eta$ with $\dim(E_1\cap\ldots\cap E_m) = d-m(d-k)$. For this intersection process, the total $d-m(d-k)$-dimensional volume $F^{(m)}_r$ of the process in $B_r$, again as $r \to \infty$, is of particular interest. For $2k \leq d+1$ it has been shown that $F^{(m)}_r$ is again asymptotically normally distributed. For $m \geq 2$, the limit is so far unknown, although it has been shown for certain $d$ and $k$ that it cannot be a normal distribution.
  We determine the limit distribution for all values of $d,k,m$. In addition, we establish explicit rates of convergence in the Kolmogorov distance and discuss properties of the limit distribution. Furthermore we show that the asymptotic covariance matrix of the vector $(F^{(1)}_r,\ldots,F^{(m)}_r)^\top$ has full rank when $2k &lt; d+1$ and rank one when $2k \geq d+1$.</description>

      <title>Volume entropy of a family of rank one, split-solvable Lie groups of Abelian type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of metrics on Euclidean space that generalize the left-invariant metric of the SOL group and the metric of the logarithmic model of Hyperbolic space. Suppose G is a connected, simply-connected, Heintze group of Abelian type with diagonalizable derivation or the horospherical product of two such groups. In this scenario, G is isometric to Euclidean space with a metric of the type considered. We have derived a formula for the volume entropy of metrics in this family and used it to solve a conjecture related to a family of 3-manifolds that interpolates between the SOL group and hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Finite index rigidity of hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the topological complexity of a finite index subgroup of a hyperbolic group is linear in its index. This follows from a more general result relating the size of the quotient of a free cocompact action of hyperbolic group on a graph to the minimal number of cells in a simplicial classifying space for the group. As a corollary we prove that any two isomorphic finite-index subgroups of a non-elementary hyperbolic group have the same index.</description>

      <title>Order-2 Delaunay Triangulations Optimize Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local angle property of the (order-$1$) Delaunay triangulations of a generic set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ asserts that the sum of two angles opposite a common edge is less than $\pi$. This paper extends this property to higher order and uses it to generalize two classic properties from order-$1$ to order-$2$: (1) among the complete level-$2$ hypertriangulations of a generic point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the order-$2$ Delaunay triangulation lexicographically maximizes the sorted angle vector; (2) among the maximal level-$2$ hypertriangulations of a generic point set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the order-$2$ Delaunay triangulation is the only one that has the local angle property. We also use our method of establishing (2) to give a new short proof of the angle vector optimality for the (order-1) Delaunay triangulation. For order-$1$, both properties have been instrumental in numerous applications of Delaunay triangulations, and we expect that their generalization will make order-$2$ Delaunay triangulations more attractive to applications as well.</description>

      <title>Introduction to graph theory and basic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book collects the lectures about graph theory and its applications which were given to students of mathematical departments of Moscow State University and Peking University. Graph theory is a very wide field with a lot of applications in almost every scientific area: in many branches of mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology and also in psychology, arts, philosophy and many others. Nowadays, graph theory becomes especially more important because of the rapid development of molecular biology, neural networks and AI fields. One of the aims of writing this book was to give students thorough knowledge about graphs to understand modern scientific fields more deeply. Here we tried to give classical and modern theorems and algorithms in more understandable and simple way. We spent many time to rewrite them and close the gaps in several simplest well-known proofs to provide more precise and accurate material for students.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04885v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that if $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ is a Borel set of Hausdorff dimension $\dim A&gt;1$, and if $\rho_{\theta}$ is orthogonal projection to the line spanned by $( \cos \theta, \sin \theta, 1 )$, then $\rho_{\theta}(A)$ has positive length for all $\theta$ outside a set of Hausdorff dimension at most $\frac{3-\dim A}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Gap phenomena under curvature restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper we discuss gap phenomena of three different types related to Ricci (and sectional) curvature. The first type is about spectral gaps. The second type is about sharp gap metric-rigidity, originally due to Anderson. The third is about sharp gap topological-rigidity. We also propose open problems along these directions.</description>
