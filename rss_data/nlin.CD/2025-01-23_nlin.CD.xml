      <title>Synchronization of branching chain of coupled maps: application to the logistic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the synchronization dynamics in a chain of coupled chaotic maps organized in a single-parent family tree, whose properties can be captured considering each parent node connected to two children, one of which also serves as the parent for the subsequent node. Our analysis focuses on two distinct synchronization behaviors: parent-child synchronization, defined by the vanishing distance between successive nodes along the chain, and sibling synchronization, corresponding to the convergence of the states of two child nodes. Our findings reveal significant differences in these two type of synchronization mechanisms, which are closely associated with the probability distribution of the state of parent node. Theoretical analysis and simulations with the logistic map support our findings. We further investigate numerical aspects of the implementation corresponding to cases for which the simulated regimes differ from the theoretically predicted one due to computational finite accuracy. We perform a detailed study on how instabilities are numerically suppressed or amplified along the chain. In some cases, a properly adjusted computational scheme can solve this problem.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium and Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work concentrates on relations, which are general and model independent in chaotic system, between time averages of a few (typically {\it very few}) observables. Equilibrium thermodynamics provides a guide and here is attempted to argue that the viewpoint of Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen can be regarded as a generalization to nonequilibrum phenomena of the theory of the ensembles proposing an answer to classical question like which distributions describe the statistics of stationary states (hence extend the analysis selecting canonical, or equivalent distributions, equilibrim between the uncountably many possibilities). The special name "Chaothic Hypothesis" (CH) is given to the above attempt and its mathematical meaning is discussed. General properties are presented and applied (eg. 'Fluctuation Theorem', 'Fluctuation Patterns', 'Pairing Symmetry') and related to the basic Time Reversal symmetry: which presents irreversibility as due to chaotic motion rather than to viscous forces. The case of a simple incompressible fluid is discussed in some detail. The possibility that CH is violated in various cases is considered: and in the end it is suggested that CH is the paradigm of chaotic evolution, as the harmonic oscillators are a paradigm of ordered motions, but of course {\it tertium datur}. The exposition is informal and often restricted to heuristic analysis, with detailed references to the literature and attention to numerical simulations and importance of stressing strongly the discrete models of Physics, trying to imitate the vision of Boltzmann, is widely considered.</description>

      <title>Graph Structure of the Generalized Tent Map over Ring $\mathbb{Z}_{2^e}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of functional graphs of nonlinear systems provides one of the most intuitive methods for analyzing their properties in digital domain. The generalized Tent map is particularly suitable for studying the degradation of dynamic behaviors in the digital domain due to its significantly varied dynamical behaviors across different parameters in the continuous domain. This paper quantifies the generalized Tent map under various parameters to investigate the dynamic degradation that occurs when implemented in fixed-precision arithmetic. Additionally, the small period problem caused by the indeterminate point in the fixed-point domain is addressed by transforming the parameters. The period of the mapping in the fixed-point domain is optimized by introducing disturbances, resulting in an optimized mapping that is a permutation mapping. Furthermore, the paper reveals the dynamic degradation of analogous one-dimensional maps in fixed-precision domains and provides a more orderly design for this map.</description>

      <title>Propagation of extreme events in multiplex neuronal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous studies, the propagation of extreme events across nodes in monolayer networks has been extensively studied. In this work, we extend this investigation to explore the propagation of extreme events between two distinct layers in a multiplex network. We consider a two-layer network, where one layer is globally coupled and exhibits extreme events, while the second layer remains uncoupled. The interlayer connections between the layers are either unidirectional or bidirectional. We find that unidirectional coupling between the layers can induce extreme events in the uncoupled layer, whereas bidirectional coupling tends to mitigate extreme events in the globally coupled layer. To characterize extreme and non-extreme states, we use probability plots to identify distinct regions in the parameter space. Additionally, we study the robustness of extreme events emergence by examining various network topologies in the uncoupled layer. The mechanism behind the occurrence of extreme events is explored, with a particular focus on the transition from asynchronous states to a fully synchronized excitable state. For numerical simulations, we use nonidentical FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons at each node, which captures the dynamical behavior of both coupled and uncoupled layers. Our findings suggest that extreme events in the uncoupled layer emerge through the gradual disappearance of disorder, accompanied by occasional bursts of synchronized activity. Results obtained in this work will serve a starting point in understanding the dynamics behind the propagation of extreme events in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Spacing ratios in mixed-type systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of the consecutive level-spacing ratio is now widely used as a tool to distinguish integrable from chaotic quantum spectra, mostly due to its avoiding of the numerical spectral unfolding. Similar to the use of the Rosenzweig-Porter approach to obtain the Berry-Robnik distribution of level-spacings in mixed-type systems, in this work we extend this approach to derive analytically the distribution of spacing ratios, for random matrices comprised of independent integrable blocks and chaotic blocks. We have numerically confirmed this analytical result using random matrix theory in paradigmatic models such as the quantum kicked rotor and the H\'enon-Heiles system.</description>

      <title>Bailout Embedding and Stability Analysis of a Dynamical Mean-Field Ising Model of Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of a discrete-time dynamical mean-field Ising model to perturbations. This model belongs to a broader class of models often used in the study of opinion dynamics in financial markets. In the presence of noise, these iterated maps are known to exhibit dynamics which resemble empirically observed behavior of financial markets, such as volatility clustering. Research in the recent past has identified attractor bubbling as one of the underlying mechanisms that lead to clustering of high volatility events in models of opinion dynamics. In this work, we employ the method of bailout embedding to create an extended, higher-dimensional system of iterated maps where the bubbling dynamics is isolated from dynamics in the original lower-dimensional space. The bailout embedding technique also introduces a bailout parameter and an associated bailout function which allows us to systematically induce several regimes of stability in the opinion dynamics and thus enables us to better understand the onset of attractor bubbling in this system. We demonstrate the occurrence of intermittency in opinion dynamics under appropriate conditions, with the discrete opinion dynamics sharing characteristics of empirically observed financial time series with volatility clustering. Inspired by the original context under which bailout embeddings were introduced, we propose an interpretation of the bailout function as a measure of investor inertia in the markets. This work hopes to demonstrate the usefulness of bailout embeddings as a tool to study mathematical models of financial market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong turbulence in self-focusing and defocusing media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the focusing and defocusing Nonlinear Schrodinger Equations have similar behavior in the weak turbulence regime, they must differ dramatically in the strong turbulence regime. Here, we show that this difference is already present at next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity in the weak turbulence regime: The one-loop correction to the interaction vertex suppresses repulsion (like screening in electrodynamics), leading to a steeper spectrum in the defocusing case. In contrast, attraction enhancement (like antiscreening in chromodynamics) makes the spectrum less steep in the focusing case. To describe strong turbulence, we consider a vector model in the limit of a large number of components. A large-N kinetic equation, valid at all scales, can be derived analytically. It has an inverse-cascade solution whose two asymptotics, at high and low wavenumbers, describe weak and strong turbulence, respectively. We find two forms of universality in the strong turbulence spectrum: in focusing media it is independent of the flux magnitude, while in defocusing media it is independent of the bare coupling constant, with the largest scale appearing instead.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of a charged particle subject to two non-stationary currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non relativistic motions of a charged particle in the electromagnetic field generated by two parallel electrically neutral vertical wires carrying time depends currents. Under quantitative conditions on the currents we prove the existence of a vertical strip of stable motions of the particle. The stable strip is contained in the plane of the two wires and the stability is understood in a stronger sense than the isoenergetic stability of Hamiltonian systems. Actually, also variations of the integral given by the linear momentum will be allowed.</description>
