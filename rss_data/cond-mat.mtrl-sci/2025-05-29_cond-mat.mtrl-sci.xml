      <title>Ultra-long-living magnons in the quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence time is the property of a quantum system that determines how long a state can hold quantum information. This parameter is directly bound to their lifetime in solid-state systems, where quantum information could be stored in quasiparticles. For decades, quasiparticles associated with magnetization order disturbance - magnons, had reported lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, restricting their use as a quantum information carrier. Here, we report on the observation of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18{\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment has been performed in an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet sphere in a wide range of temperatures from ambient down to 30 mK. Our results open doors for using magnons as data carriers in modern solid-state quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>PdNeuRAM: Forming-Free, Multi-Bit Pd/HfO2 ReRAM for Energy-Efficient Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristor technology shows great promise for energy-efficient computing, yet it grapples with challenges like resistance drift and inherent variability. For filamentary Resistive RAM (ReRAM), one of the most investigated types of memristive devices, the expensive electroforming step required to create conductive pathways results in increased power and area overheads and reduced endurance. In this study, we present novel HfO2-based forming-free ReRAM devices, PdNeuRAM, that operate at low voltages, support multi-bit functionality, and display reduced variability. Through a deep understanding and comprehensive material characterization, we discover the key process that allows this unique behavior: a Pd-O-Hf configuration that capitalizes on Pd innate affinity for integrating into HfO2. This structure actively facilitates charge redistribution at room temperature, effectively eliminating the need for electroforming. Moreover, the fabricated ReRAM device provides tunable resistance states for dense memory and reduces programming and reading energy by 43% and 73%, respectively, using spiking neural networks (SNN). This study reveals novel mechanistic insights and delineates a strategic roadmap for the realization of power-efficient and cost-effective ReRAM devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry tuning topological states of an axion insulator with noncollinear magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological properties of quantum materials are intimately related to symmetry. Here, we tune the magnetic order of the axion insulator candidate EuIn$_2$As$_2$ from its broken-helix ground state to the field-polarized phase by applying an in-plane magnetic field. Using results from neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements with ab inito theory and symmetry analysis, we determine how the field tunes the magnetic symmetry within individual magnetic domains and examine the resulting changes to the topological surface states and hinge states existing on edges shared by certain surfaces hosting gapped Dirac states. We predict field-tunable complex and domain-specific hinge-state patterns, with some crystal surfaces undergoing a field-induced topological phase transition. We further find that domain walls have pinned hinge states when intersecting certain crystal surfaces, providing another channel for tuning the chiral-charge-transport pathways.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Stability and Linearly Polarized Emission from CsPbI3 Perovskite Nanoplatelets through A-site Cation Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropy of perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) opens up many opportunities in optoelectronics, including enabling the emission of linearly polarized light. But the limited stability of PeNPLs is a pressing challenge, especially for red-emitting CsPbI3. Herein, we address this limitation by alloying FA into the perovskite cuboctahedral site. Unlike Cs/FA alloying in bulk thin films or nonconfined nanocubes, FA incorporation in nanoplatelets requires meticulous control over the reaction conditions, given that nanoplatelets are obtained in kinetically-driven growth regimes instead of thermodynamically-driven conditions. Through in-situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements, we find that excess FA leads to uncontrolled growth, where phase-impurities and nanoplatelets of multiple thicknesses co-exist. Restricting the FA content to up to 25% Cs substitution enables monodisperse PeNPLs, and increases the PL quantum yield (from 53% to 61%), exciton lifetime (from 18 ns to 27 ns), and stability in ambient air (from ~2 days to &gt;7 days) compared to CsPbI3. This arises due to hydrogen bonding between FA and the oleate and oleylammonium ligands, anchoring them to the surface to improve optoelectronic properties and stability. The reduction in non-radiative recombination, improvement in the nanoplatelet aspect ratio, and higher ligand density lead to FA-containing PeNPLs more effectively forming edge-up superlattices, enhancing the PL degree of linear polarization from 5.1% (CsPbI3) to 9.4% (Cs0.75FA0.25PbI3). These fundamental insights show how the stability limitations of PeNPLs could be addressed, and these materials grown more precisely to improve their performance as polarized light emitters, critical for utilizing them in next-generation display, bioimaging and communications applications.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale quantum imaging of field-free deterministic switching of a chiral antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) with tunable spin generation open new pathways for designing novel magnetization control for cutting-edge spintronics innovations. A leading research thrust is to develop field-free deterministic magnetization switching for implementing scalable and energy favorable magnetic recording and storage applications, which have been demonstrated in conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic material systems. Here we extend this advanced magnetization control strategy to chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using spin currents with out-of-plane canted polarization generated from low-symmetry van der Waals (vdW) material WTe2. Numerical calculations suggest that damping-like SOT of spins injected perpendicular to the kagome plane of Mn3Sn serves as a driving force to rotate the chiral magnetic order, while the field-like SOT of spin currents with polarization parallel to the kagome plane provides the bipolar deterministicity to the magnetic switching. We further introduce scanning quantum microscopy to visualize nanoscale evolutions of Mn3Sn magnetic domains during the field-free switching process, corroborating the exceptionally large magnetic switching ratio up to 90%. Our results highlight the opportunities provided by hybrid SOT material platforms consisting of noncollinear antiferromagnets and low-symmetry vdW spin source materials for developing next-generation, transformative spintronic logic devices.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Transverse Dielectric Response in Ferroelectric Dielectric Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the emergence of a transverse dielectric response in PbTiO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ superlattices hosting polar vortex structures. Using second-principles simulations, we find that an electric field applied along one direction induces significant local polarization responses along orthogonal directions, with magnitudes approaching half that of the diagonal susceptibility components. These off-diagonal responses are strongly dependent on the topology of the vortex structure and can be deterministically tuned or even reversed via homogeneous electric fields or epitaxial strain. Notably, the transverse susceptibilities become comparable to the diagonal components during a field- or strain-induced transition to a polarization wave state. This discovery opens avenues for engineering reconfigurable nanoscale dielectric responses in topologically textured ferroelectric systems.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are severely limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, which reveals a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating. Evaporation rates dramatically increase with short-wavelength illumination. Violet-light illumination achieves 4-10x higher evaporation enhancement compared to orange and IR light. Our results identify a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation and opportunities to employ ceramic wicks for salt harvesting. Such low-cost, low-energy desalination systems would reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.</description>

      <title>Diverse edge states of nanoribbons and excitonic insulator states of the monolayer Ta2Ni3Te5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ta2Ni3Te5, a layered transition metal chalcogenide with quasi-one-dimensional electronic states, exhibits rich topological and correlated phenomena. Using first-principles calculations, we explore Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons, demonstrating tunable electronic and magnetic properties-ranging from metallic to semimetallic and semiconducting (band gaps of 29.7-60.8 meV), and from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic-controlled by edge (Ni or Ta), ribbon width, and H/F saturation. Additionally, GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations, complemented by metaGGA-based modified BSE, reveal that the Ta2Ni3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator, with an exciton binding energy exceeding its band gap. These diverse properties position Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons and monolayers as promising candidates for nanoelectronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics, motivating further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Parametric Instability in Discrete Models of Spatiotemporally Modulated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of parametric instability in discrete models of spatiotemporally modulated materials. These materials are celebrated in part because they exhibit nonreciprocal transmission characteristics. However, parametric instability may occur for strong modulations, or occasionally even at very small modulation amplitudes, and prevent the safe operation of spatiotemporally modulated devices due to an exponential growth in the response amplitude. We use Floquet theory to conduct a detailed computational investigation of parametric instability. We explore the roles of modulation parameters (frequency, amplitude, wavenumber), the number of modulated units, and damping on the stability of the system. We highlight the pivotal role of spatial modulation in parametric instability, a feature that is predominantly overlooked in this context. We use the perturbation method to obtain analytical expressions for modulation frequencies at which the response becomes unstable. We hope that our findings enable and inspire new applications of spatiotemporally modulated materials that operate at higher amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Framework for Characterizing Processing-Structure Relationship in Block Copolymer Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ &gt; 0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ &lt; 0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.</description>

      <title>Optical Controllable Spin-Polarization in Two Dimensional Altermagnets via Robust Spin-Momentum Locking Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking (SML) excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors are appealing to programmable optical control of spin-polarized carriers in ultrafast spintronics. To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($&gt;$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics.</description>

      <title>Sequential tilting 4D-STEM for improved momentum-resolved STEM field mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Momentum-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (MRSTEM) is a powerful phase-contrast technique that can map lateral magnetic and electric fields ranging from the micrometer to the subatomic scale. Resolving fields ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers, as well as across material junctions, is particularly important since these fields often determine the functional properties of devices. However, it is also challenging since they are orders of magnitude smaller than atomic electric fields. Thus, subtle changes in diffraction conditions lead to significant changes in the measured MRSTEM signal. One established approach to partially overcome this problem is precession electron diffraction, in which the incident electron beam is continuously precessed while precession-averaged diffraction patterns are acquired. Here, we present an alternative approach in which we sequentially tilt the incident electron beam and record a full diffraction pattern for each tilt and spatial position. This approach requires no hardware modification of the instrument and enables the use of arbitrary beam tilt patterns that can be optimized for specific applications. Furthermore, recording diffraction patterns for every beam tilt allows access to additional information. In this work, we use this information to create virtual large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (vLACBED) patterns to assess MRSTEM data quality and improve field measurements by applying different data analysis methods beyond simple averaging. The presented data acquisition concept can readily be applied to other 4D-STEM applications.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Temperature Dependence of Exciton Diamagnetism in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered hybrid perovskites containing larger organic cations have demonstrated superior environmental stability, but the presence of these insulating spacers also strengthens the exciton binding energy, which contributes to reduced carrier separation. The consequences of increased binding energy on device efficiency are still not fully documented, and binding energy measurements are often conducted at cryogenic temperatures where linewidths are decreased and a series of hydrogen-like bound states can be identified, but not under ambient conditions where devices are expected to operate. In contrast to the quenching observed in 3D perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide, where exciton binding energies are thought to decrease at higher temperatures, we present evidence for a smaller excitonic radius at higher temperatures in the $n=5$ member of butylammonium-spaced methylammonium lead iodide, (BA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$Pb$_n$I$_{3n+1}$. We measured the temperature-dependent diamagnetic shift coefficient in magnetic fields up to 40\,T, which is one-third as large at room temperature as those at cryogenic temperatures. In both the ideal 2D and 3D hydrogen models, this trend would indicate that the exciton binding energy more than triples at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Si(100)-SiO$_2$ Trap Density Dependence on Sample Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As silicon-based devices continue to shrink to the nanoscale, traps at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface pose increasing challenges to device performance. These traps reduce channel carrier mobility and shift threshold voltages in integrated circuits, and introduce charge noise in quantum systems, reducing their coherence times. Knowledge of the precise location of such traps aids in understanding their influence on device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (fm-AFM) allows the detection of individual traps. We use this to study how sample preparation, specifically the introduction of a buried hydrogen termination layer, and post-processing annealing in forming gas (N$_2$+H$_2$), affects the density of donor-like traps in Si(100)-SiO$_2$ systems. We spatially map and quantify traps in both conventionally prepared ("pristine") silicon samples and those processed under ultra-high vacuum for hydrogen resist lithography (HRL). We confirm previous studies demonstrating hydrogen passivation of traps and find that hydrogen termination further reduces the donor-like trap density. We also observe a significant reduction in two-level donor-like traps in the hydrogen-terminated samples compared to pristine silicon samples. These findings suggest that HRL-prepared silicon may offer advantages for high-performance nanoscale and atomic-scale devices due to reduced trap densities.</description>

      <title>Localized Triplons and Site Stuffing in the Quantum Dimer Magnet BiYbGeO$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e order from diffuse nesting near higher-order Van Hove points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translation symmetry-breaking order is assumed to be suppressed by the lack of Fermi surface nesting near certain higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS). We show the anisotropic band-flattening inherent to such HOVHS, combined with broadening of the Fermi surface due to elevated critical temperatures, results in the Fermi surface becoming approximately nested at a wavevector unrelated to the precise shape of the Fermi surface - leading to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ Kekul\'e density wave formation. The effect is demonstrated using unbiased renormalization group calculations for a model of the breathing kagome lattice. Our mechanism - termed diffuse nesting - represents an entirely new notion in the study of Fermi surface instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Similar to other perovskites in its family, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits a significant softening of the ferroelectric mode with decreasing temperature, a behavior that typically heralds the onset of a ferroelectric transition. However, this material remains paraelectric down to 0K due to the Heisenberg quantum uncertainty principle that prevents atoms from localizing in the ferroelectric minima, a fundamental limit that appears impossible to overcome. This work shows that in the strong out-of-equilibrium regime induced by resonant mid-IR pulses, quantum fluctuations can be suppressed, effectively cooling the material below the 0K ground state and inducing a ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ that is otherwise impossible. The appearance of a metastable state, that is distinct from the conventional ground state, is the first demonstration of how it is possible to leverage and control quantum fluctuations with pulsed light to qualitatively alter the free energy landscape of a quantum system. We predict the conditions and system parameter under which induced non-equilibrium state can be long-lived and even permanent. In providing a quantitative description, based on first principles machine learned potential energy surface, we explain recent experimental observations of light-induced ferroelectric transition in this material.</description>

      <title>Selenization of V2O5/WO3 Bilayers for Tuned Optoelectronic Response of WSe2 Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable and controlled doping of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is essential for tuning their electronic and optoelectronic properties. In this work, we demonstrate a robust approach for substitution of vanadium in tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) via the selenization of pre-deposited V$_2$O$_5$/WO$_3$ thin films. By adjusting the thickness of the vanadium oxide layer, the V concentration in W$_{1-x}$V$_x$Se$_2$ is systematically varied. Electrical measurements on field-effect transistors reveal a substantial enhancement in hole conduction, with drain current increasing by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to undoped WSe$_2$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity indicates a clear insulator-to-metal transition with increasing V content, likely due to band structure modifications. Concurrently, the photoconductive gain decreases, suggesting enhanced recombination and charge screening effects. These results establish vanadium doping via selenization of V$_2$O$_5$/WO$_3$ films as a scalable strategy for modulating the transport and photoresponse of WSe$_2$, offering promising implications for wafer-scale optoelectronic device integration.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>Dynamic signature of the thermodynamic transition in a novel mean field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbours. These pseudo neighbours enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T_K. We propose a phenomenological relation between T_K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Control of Topological End States in Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons on a 2D Ferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailor-made graphene nanostructures can exhibit symmetry-protected topological boundary states that host localized spin-$1/2$ moments. However, one frequently observes charge transfer on coinage metal substrates, which results in spinless closed-shell configurations. Using low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate here that pristine topologically nontrivial chiral graphene nanoribbons synthesized directly on the ferromagnet $\textrm{GdAu}_2$ can either maintain a charge-neutral diradical singlet or triplet configuration, or exist in a singly anionic doublet state. As an underlying mechanism, we identify a moir\'{e}-modulated work function and exchange field, as corroborated by Kelvin-probe force microscopy and spin-flip spectroscopy. The joint electrostatic and magnetic interactions allow reversibly switching between the three spin multiplicities by atomic manipulation. We introduce an effective Hubbard dimer model that unifies the effects of local electrostatic gating, electron-electron-correlation, hybridization and exchange field to outline the phase diagram of accessible spin states. Our results establish a platform for the local control of $\pi$-radicals adsorbed on metallic substrates.</description>

      <title>Dominant Kitaev interaction and field-induced quantum phase transitions in triangular-lattice KCeSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing Kitaev interactions on triangular lattices offers a compelling platform for exploring quantum-spin-liquid physics beyond the conventional honeycomb lattice framework. Here, we investigate the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet KCeSe2, where multiple probes reveal strong magnetic anisotropy suggesting significant Kitaev physics. Through detailed and combined analysis of magnetization, neutron scattering, and thermodynamic experiments, we identify dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev ($K = -1.82$ K) and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ($J = 1.34$ K) interactions that stabilize a stripe-$yz$ ordered ground state via an order-by-disorder mechanism. Magnetic fields applied along the Kitaev bond direction induce two phase transitions at 1.67 T and 3.8 T, consistent with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations predictions of a progression from stripe-$yz$ to stripe-canted and spin-polarized phases. Near the 1.67 T quantum critical point, enhanced quantum fluctuations suggest conditions favorable for exotic excitations. These results establish KCeSe2 as a platform for exploring Kitaev physics on triangular lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop a fully analytic algorithm to compute its expansion coefficients. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. Moreover, the analytic frequency dependence in the expansion allows for stable analytic continuation to the real-frequency dynamic structure factor. This important application is discussed in a companion letter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling are responsible for important cooperative phenomena in metals such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. The same interaction mechanisms produce strong collision rates in the normal phase of correlated metals, causing sizeable reductions of the dc conductivity and reflectivity. As a consequence, low-energy excitations like phonons, which are crucial for materials characterization, become visible in optical infrared spectra. A quantitative assessment of vibrational resonances requires the evaluation of dynamical Born effective charges, which quantify the coupling between macroscopic electric fields and lattice deformations. We show that the Born effective charges of metals crucially depend on the collision regime of conducting electrons. In particular, we describe, within a first principles framework, the impact of electron scattering on the infrared vibrational resonances, from the undamped, collisionless regime to the overdamped, collision-dominated limit. Our approach enables the interpretation of vibrational reflectance measurements of both super and bad conducting metals, as we illustrate for the case of strongly electron-phonon coupled superhydride H$_3$S.</description>

      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is introduced, which, for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll-gaps. The model is based on multiple-scales asymptotics, assuming a long thin roll-gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long lengthscale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab models. The next-order correction varies on both this long lengthscale and a short lengthscale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. This model can form the foundation of further improved models with more complicated mechanics in the future. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is a universal effect that generates electric polarization due to broken inversion symmetry caused by local strain gradient. The large strain gradient at nanoscale makes flexo-electric effects, especially in nanoscopic ferroelectric materials, promising in sensors, actuator, energy harvesting, and memory applications. In this work, we studied flexoelectricity in hexagonal ferrites h-YbFeO3, an improper ferroelectric expected to have weak piezoelectricity and low sensitivity to depolarization field, which are advantageous for studying flexoelectric effects. We show that in h-YbFeO3 epitaxial thin films, strain gradient on the order of 10^6 m-1 occurs near grain boundaries and edge dislocation, which has a significant impact on the non-polar K3 structural distortion that induces spontaneous polarization. The phenomenological model based on the Landau theory of improper ferroelectricity suggests an indirect flexoelectric effect on the order of 10 nC/m in h-YbFeO3, which is substantially larger than the expectation from Kogan mechanism. These results reveal a novel microscopic mechanism of coupling between strain gradient and polarization mediated by structural distortion, which we call improper flexoelectricity.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Gradient-Based Methods: Multi-Property Materials Design Beyond Differentiable Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at which the other methods fail entirely.</description>

Abstract: We explore the Fano resonance in ZrTe5, using Raman scattering measurements. We identified two closely spaced B2g phonon modes, B2g I and B2g II, around 9 meV and 10 meV, respectively. Interestingly, only B2g I exhibited the Fano resonance, an outcome of quantum interference between discrete phonon modes and continuous electronic excitations. This is consistent with the much stronger electron-phonon coupling of B2g I mode demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Additionally, temperature-dependent measurements highlight an enhanced Fano asymmetry at elevated temperatures, contributed by the thermal renormalization of the band structure and electron-phonon coupling. This study offers insights into the complex interrelation of electron-phonon coupling, thermal effects, and Fano resonances in ZrTe5.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Favorability of the 1T Phase over the 1H Phase in Group III Metal Monochalcogenide Zigzag Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05971</link>

Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectronic and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that non-polar 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically more favorable than polar 1H MX ZNRs at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence bands. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</description>

Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

      <title>Charge Orders in Fully Intercalated Bilayer TaSe$_2$: Dependence on Interlayer Stacking and Intercalation Sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative models for the quasi-static and dynamic response due to slip in an elastic body containing a single slip plane of vanishing thickness are developed. Discrete dislocations with continuously distributed cores can glide on this plane, and the models are developed as special cases of a fully three-dimensional theory of plasticity induced by dislocation motion. The reduced models are compared and contrasted with the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics. A primary distinguishing feature of the reduced models is the a-priori accounting of space-time conservation of Burgers vector during dislocation evolution. A physical shortcoming of the developed models as well as the Peierls model with regard to a dependence on the choice of a distinguished, coherent reference configuration is discussed, and a testable model without such dependence is also proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a local regional chemical potential (RCP) analysis method based on an energy window scheme to quantitatively estimate the selectivity of atomic and molecular adsorption on surfaces, as well as the strength of chemical bonding forces between a probe tip and a surface in atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. In particular, focusing on the local picture of covalent bonding, we use a simple H$_2$ molecular model to demonstrate a clear relationship between chemical bonding forces and the local RCP. Moreover, density functional theory calculations on molecular systems and diamond C(001) surfaces reveal that the local RCP at the surfaces successfully visualizes electron-donating regions such as dangling bonds and double bonds. These results suggest that the local RCP can serve as an effective measure to analyze high-resolution non-contact or near-contact AFM images enhanced by chemical bonding forces.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.</description>

      <title>A Straightforward Gradient-Based Approach for High-Tc Superconductor Design: Leveraging Domain Knowledge via Adaptive Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties. However, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional element-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various domain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast, deep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet they struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these trade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines these strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method, chemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using property prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce diverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as oxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and their abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the integer loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising candidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from unfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach demonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates, uncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than conventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could propose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including new hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share compositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of domain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust foundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for superconductors and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at https://tkreiman.github.io/projects/mlff_distribution_shifts/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for a quantum-well-exciton resonance with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Is GGAG:Ce@SiO$_2$-RB composite a prospective material for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanocomposite material ($\mathrm{GGAG:Ce^{3+}@SiO_2-RB}$) for potential use in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) was developed, thoroughly characterized, and evaluated. It consists of a scintillating $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga_{1-x}Al_x)_5O_{12}:Ce^{3+}}$ core encapsulated in silica layer and functionalized with the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Radioluminescence measurements confirmed the energy transfer from the scintillating core to Rose Bengal. Dark toxicity and radiosensitisation effects were evaluated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The nanocomposite showed minimal dark toxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mg/mL. However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.</description>
