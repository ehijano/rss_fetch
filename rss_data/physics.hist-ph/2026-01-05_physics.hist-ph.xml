      <title>From Grounding to Stabilisation: Adequacy as a Criterion for Scientific Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a process-based account of scientific explanation that reconceives grounding in terms of stabilisation. Grounding theories capture hierarchical dependence but lack criteria for when explanations remain adequate under model updates, perturbations, and theory change. Stabilisation is formally defined by a schema \(C \to P(I)\), where explanatory relations are sufficient when they preserve specified relational invariants under admissible transformations. This replaces the search for ultimate foundations with operational adequacy tests indexed to measurable invariance, resolving infinite regress worries while preserving a modest scientific realism. Applications show unifying power: theory change becomes an empirical question about structural continuity; quantum measurement becomes apparatus-dependent pattern selection; the effectiveness of mathematics reflects convergence on transformation-invariant descriptions; and emergence versus reduction reduces to stability of cross-level mappings. The black hole event horizon illustrates how ontologically identical states can diverge in admissible evolution, revealing process as explanatorily fundamental. Companion work develops apparatus-dependent adequacy protocols, including pointer-basis rotation and coupling-spectra methods, turning the framework into a falsifiable research programme across quantum, thermodynamic, and relativistic domains.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</description>

      <title>Mathematics in the liturgical books of the Catholic Church: phases of the ecclesiastical moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00474v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use contemporary mathematical notation to describe the method for determining the age of the ecclesiastical moon as mandated by pope Gregory XIII and elaborated in the book of Christopher Clavius \emph{Romani calendarii explicatio}. The algorithm is first introduced by using the tabular method employed by liturgical books such as the Roman Missal, Breviary and Martyrology. Then we construct the recurrence equation for the epacts, derive its solution, and give a simple expression for the age of the moon on a given day of the year. We also consider the problems which can occur at the transition from December 31 to January 1 of the next year, when there could be a ``jump'' in moon's age ("saltus lunae") in years when epact corrections are applied. We propose a simple solution which fixes these problems. A summary of the formulae and listing of the implementation of relevant functions in Python is provided in the last section.</description>
