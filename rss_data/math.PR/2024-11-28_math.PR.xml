      <title>Ordered random walks and the Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Airy line ensemble is a random collection of continuous ordered paths that plays an important role within random matrix theory and the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. The aim of this paper is to prove a universality property of the Airy line ensemble. We study growing numbers of i.i.d. continuous-time random walks which are then conditioned to stay in the same order for all time using a Doob h-transform. We consider a general class of increment distributions; a sufficient condition is the existence of an exponential moment and a log-concave density. We prove that the top particles in this system converge in an edge scaling limit to the Airy line ensemble in a regime where the number of random walks is required to grow slower than a certain power (with a non-optimal exponent 3/50) of the expected number of random walk steps. Furthermore, in a similar regime we prove that the law of large numbers and fluctuations of linear statistics agree with non-intersecting Brownian motions.</description>

      <title>Besov regularity of random wavelet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Besov regularity of wavelet series on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with randomly chosen coefficients. More precisely, each coefficient is a product of a random factor and a parameterized deterministic factor (decaying with the scale $j$ and the norm of the shift $m$). Compared to the literature, we impose relatively mild conditions on the moments of the random variables in order to characterize the almost sure convergence of the wavelet series in Besov spaces $B^s_{p,q}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and the finiteness of the moments as well as of the moment generating function of the Besov norm. In most cases, we achieve a complete characterization, i.e., the derived conditions are both necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a stationary sequence of random variables we derive a self-normalized functional limit theorem under joint regular variation with index $\alpha \in (0,2)$ and weak dependence conditions. The convergence takes place in the space of real-valued cadlag functions on $[0,1]$ with the Skorokhod $M_{1}$ topology.</description>

      <title>Large systems of symmetrized trapped Brownian Bridges and Schrodinger processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a large system of $N$ Brownian motions in $\R ^d$ fixed on a time interval $[0,\beta]$ with symmetrized initial and terminal conditions, under the influence of a trap potential. Such systems describe systems of bosons at positive temperatures confined in a spatial domain. We describe the large $N$ behavior of the averaged path (that is, their empirical path measure) and its connection with a well known optimal transport problem formulated by Erwin Schr\"odinger. We also explore the asymptotic behavior of the Brownian motions in terms of Large Deviations. In particular, the rate function that governs the mean of occupation measures turns out to be the well-known Donsker-Varadhan rate function. We therefore prove a simple formula for the large $N$ asymptotic of the symmetrized trace of $e^{-\beta \Hcal_N}$, where $\Hcal_N$ is an $N$ particle Hamilton operator in a trap</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give excursion theoretical proofs of Lehoczky's formula (in an extended form allowing a lower bound for the underlying diffusion) for the joint distribution of the first drawdown time and the maximum before this time, and of Malyutin's formula for the joint distribution of the first hitting time and the maximum drawdown before this time. It is remarkable -- but there is a clean explanation -- that the excursion theoretical approach which we developed first for Lehoczky's formula provides also a proof for Malyutin's formula. Moreover, we discuss some generalizations and analyze the pure jump process describing the maximum before the first drawdown time when the size of the drawdown is varying</description>

      <title>A unimodular random graph with large upper growth and no growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a unimodular random rooted graph with maximal degree $d\geq 3$ and upper growth rate $d-1$, which does not have a growth rate. Ab\'ert, Fraczyk and Hayes showed that for a unimodular random tree, if the upper growth rate is at least $\sqrt{d-1}$, then the growth rate exists, and asked with some scepticism if this may hold for more general graphs. Our construction shows that the answer is negative. We also provide a non-hyperfinite example of a unimodular random graph with no growth rate. This may be of interest in light of a conjecture of Ab\'ert that unimodular Riemannian surfaces of bounded negative curvature always have growth.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Analysis for Canonical Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a large deviation theory developed for functionals of canonical Gibbs processes, i.e., Gibbs processes with respect to the binomial point process. We study the regime of a fixed intensity in a sequence of increasing windows. Our method relies on the traditional large deviation result for local bounded functionals of Poisson point processes noting that the binomial point process is obtained from the Poisson point process by conditioning on the point number. Our main methodological contribution is the development of coupling constructions allowing us to handle delicate and unlikely pathological events. The presented results cover three types of Gibbs models - a model given by a bounded local interaction, a model given by a non-negative possibly unbounded increasing local interaction and the hard-core interaction model. The derived large deviation principle is formulated for the distributions of individual empirical fields driven by canonical Gibbs processes, with its special case being a large deviation principle for local bounded observables of the canonical Gibbs processes. We also consider unbounded non-negative increasing local observables, but the price for treating this more general case is that we only get large-deviation bounds for the tails of such observables. Our primary setting is one with the periodic boundary condition, however, we also discuss generalizations for different choices of the boundary condition.</description>

      <title>A characterization of mutual absolute continuity of probability measures on a filtered space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new characterization for mutual absolute continuity of probability measures on a filtered space. For this, we introduce a martingale limit $M$ that measures the similarity between the tails of the probability measures restricted to the filtration. The measures are mutually absolutely continuous if and only if $M = 1$ holds almost surely for both measures. In this case, the square roots of the Radon-Nikodym derivatives on the filtration converge in $L^2$. Finally, we apply the result to families of random variables and stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Lower tails for triangles inside the critical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability that the random graph $G(n,p)$ is triangle-free. When $p =o(n^{-1/2})$ or $p = \omega(n^{-1/2})$ the asymptotics of the logarithm of this probability are known via Janson's inequality in the former case and via regularity or hypergraph container methods in the latter case. We prove for the first time an asymptotic formula for the logarithm of this probability when $p = c n^{-1/2}$ for $c$ a sufficiently small constant.
  More generally, we study lower-tail large deviations for triangles in random graphs: the probability that $G(n,p)$ has at most $\eta$ times its expected number of triangles, when $p = c n^{-1/2}$ for $c$ and $\eta \in [0,1)$ constant. Our results apply for all $c$ if $\eta \ge .4993$ and for $c$ small enough otherwise.
  For $\eta$ small (including the case of triangle-freeness), we prove that a phase transition occurs as $c$ varies, in the sense of a non-analyticity of the rate function, while for $\eta \ge .4993$ we prove that no phase transition occurs.
  On the other hand for the random graph $G(n,m)$, with $m = b n^{3/2}$, we show that a phase transition occurs in the lower-tail problem for triangles as $b$ varies for \emph{every} $\eta \in [0,1)$.
  Our method involves ingredients from algorithms and statistical physics including the cluster expansion and concentration inequalities for contractive Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic well-posedness of generalized cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with strong dispersion using higher order expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local well-posedness of the cubic Schr\"odinger equation $$(i\partial_t + \mathcal{L}) u = \pm |u|^2 u \qquad \textrm{on} \quad \ I\times \mathbb{R}^d ,$$ with initial data being a Wiener randomization at unit scale of a given function $f$ and $\mathcal{L}$ being an operator of degree $\sigma\geq 2$. In particular, we prove that a solution exists almost-surely locally in time provided $f\in H^{S}_{x}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ with $S&gt;\frac{2-\sigma}{4}$ for $d\leq \frac{3\sigma}{2}$, i.e. even if the initial datum is taken in certain negative order Sobolev spaces. The solutions are constructed as a sum of an explicit multilinear expansion of the flow in terms of the random initial data and of an additional smoother remainder term with deterministically subcritical regularity. We develop the framework of directional space-time norms to control the (probabilistic) multilinear expansion and the (deterministic) remainder term and to obtain improved bilinear probabilistic-deterministic Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <title>On the thresholds of degenerate hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n$-vertex $k$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate if $m_1(G)\le{d}$ and there exists a constant $\varepsilon &gt;0$ such that for every subset $U\subseteq{V(G)}$ with size $2\le|U|\le{\varepsilon n}$, we have $e\left(G[U]\right)\le{d\left(|U|-1\right)-\alpha}$. These hypergraphs include many natural graph classes, such as the degenerate hypergraphs, the planar graphs, and the power of cycles. In this paper, we consider the threshold of the emergence of a $(d,\alpha)$-degenerate hypergraph with bounded maximum degree in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model. We show that its threshold is at most $n^{-1/d}$, improving previous results of Riordan and Kelly-M\"uyesser-Pokrovskiy.</description>

      <title>Optimal root recovery for uniform attachment trees and $d$-regular growing trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider root-finding algorithms for random rooted trees grown by uniform attachment. Given an unlabeled copy of the tree and a target accuracy $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, such an algorithm outputs a set of nodes that contains the root with probability at least $1 - \varepsilon$. We prove that, for the optimal algorithm, an output set of size $\exp(O(\log^{1/2}(1/\varepsilon)))$ suffices; this bound is sharp and answers a question of Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi (2017). We prove similar bounds for random regular trees that grow by uniform attachment, strengthening a result of Khim and Loh (2017).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis of dynamical systems driven by Poisson random measures with periodic sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the dynamics of a nonlinear system governed by an ordinary differential equation under the combined influence of fast periodic sampling with period $\delta$ and small jump noise of size $\varepsilon, 0&lt; \varepsilon,\delta \ll 1.$ The noise is a combination of Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. The instantaneous rate of change of the state depends not only on its current value but on the most recent measurement of the state, as the state is measured at certain discrete-time instants. As $\varepsilon,\delta \searrow 0,$ the stochastic process of interest converges, in a suitable sense, to the dynamics of the deterministic equation. Next, the study of rescaled fluctuations of the stochastic process around its mean is found to vary depending on the relative rates of convergence of small parameters $\varepsilon, \delta$ in different asymptotic regimes. We show that the rescaled process converges, in a strong (path-wise) sense, to an effective process having an extra drift term capturing both the sampling and noise effect. Consequently, we obtain a first-order perturbation expansion of the stochastic process of interest, in terms of the effective process along with error bounds on the remainder.</description>

Abstract: Some problems in the theory and applications of stochastic processes can be reduced to solving integral equations. While explicit solutions for these equations are often elusive, valuable insights can be gained through their asymptotic analysis with respect to relevant parameters. This paper is a brief survey of some recent progress in the study of such equations related to processes with fractional covariance structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide non-asymptotic, relative deviation bounds for the eigenvalues of empirical covariance and gram matrices in general settings. Unlike typical uniform bounds, which may fail to capture the behavior of smaller eigenvalues, our results provide sharper control across the spectrum. Our analysis is based on a general-purpose theorem that allows one to convert existing uniform bounds into relative ones. The theorems and techniques emphasize simplicity and should be applicable across various settings.</description>

However, the most of the works of the last decades are focused on multivariate regular variation, while the rest of the heavy-tailed distribution classes were not studied extensively. About the multivariate subexponentiality we can find several approximations, but none of them get established widely. Having in mind the single big jump and further the multivariate subexponentiality suggested by Samorodnitsky and Sun (2016), we introduce the multivariate long, dominatedly and constistently varying distribution classes. We examine the closure properties of these classes with respect to product convolution, to scale mixture and convolution of random vectors. Especially in the class of multivariate subexponential and dominatedly varying distributions we provide the asymptotic behavior of the random vector and its normalized Levy measure, through their linear combination, that leads to their characterization. Furthermore, we study the single big jump in finite and in random sums of random vectors, permitting some dependence structures, which contain the independence as special case. Finally, we present an application on the asymptotic evaluation of the present value of the total claims in a risk model, with common Poisson counting process, general financial factors and independent, identically distributed claims, with common multivariate subexponential distribution.</description>

      <title>Local limits of random spanning trees in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the edge overlap and local limit of the random spanning tree in random environment (RSTRE) on the complete graph with $n$ vertices and weights given by $\exp(-\beta \omega_e)$ for $\omega_e$ uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$. We show that for $\beta$ growing with $\beta = o(n/\log n)$, the edge overlap is $(1+o(1)) \beta$, while for $\beta$ much larger than $n \log^2 n$, the edge overlap is $(1-o(1))n$. Furthermore, there is a transition of the local limit around $\beta = n$. When $\beta = o(n/ \log n)$ the RSTRE locally converges to the same limit as the uniform spanning tree, whereas for $\beta$ larger than $n \log^\lambda n$, where $\lambda = \lambda(n) \rightarrow \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, the local limit of the RSTRE is the same as that of the minimum spanning tree.</description>

      <title>The diameter of random spanning trees interpolating between the UST and the MST of the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ as the weighted spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ w.r.t. the random electric network of conductances $\{\exp(-\beta_nU_{e})\}_{e\in E(K_n)}$ with $\mathrm{Unif}[0,1]$ i.i.d. $U_e$'s.
  Moving from $\beta_n\equiv 0$ to faster and faster growing $\beta_n$'s, the model interpolates between the \emph{uniform} and the \emph{minimum} spanning trees: $\mathsf{WST}^0(K_n)=\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$, and there are phase transitions for $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ behaving more and more like $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$:
  - around $\beta_n=n^{3+o(1)}$ regarding the agreement of the two standard algorithms generating these models : Aldous-Broder and Prim's invasion algorithms,
  - around $\beta_n=n^{2+o(1)}$ regarding the models consisting of exactly the same edges, and
  - around $\beta_n=n^{1+o(1)}$ regarding the expected total length $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{e\in \mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)}U_e\right]$.
  But most importantly, we study the global geometry of the model: we prove that the typical diameter of $\mathsf{WST}^{\beta_n}(K_n)$ grows like $\Theta(n^{1/3})$ for $\beta_n\ge n^{4/3+o(1)}$ likewise the $\mathsf{MST}(K_n)$ case, and it grows like $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ for $\beta_n\le n^{1+o(1)}$ similarly to the $\mathsf{UST}(K_n)$ case. For $\beta_n=n^{\alpha}$ with $1&lt;\alpha&lt;4/3$, the behavior of the typical diameter is a more delicate open question, but we conjecture that its exponent strictly between 1/2 and 1/3.</description>

      <title>Liouville's theorems for L\'evy operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a L\'evy operator. A function $h$ is said to be harmonic with respect to $L$ if $L h = 0$ in an appropriate sense. We prove Liouville's theorem for positive functions harmonic with respect to a general L\'evy operator $L$: such functions are necessarily mixtures of exponentials. For signed harmonic functions we provide a fairly general result, which encompasses and extends all Liouville-type theorems previously known in this context, and which allows to trade regularity assumptions on $L$ for growth restrictions on $h$. Finally, we construct an explicit counterexample which shows that Liouville's theorem for signed functions harmonic with respect to a general L\'evy operator $L$ does not hold.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modeling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My work uses ideas from statistical physics, calculus of variations, and SPDEs, providing alternative methods that complement the measure-theoretic martingale approach that is more common in the literature.</description>

      <title>Median Based Unit Weibull (MBUW): a new unit distribution Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new 2 parameter unit Weibull distribution is defined on the unit interval (0,1). The methodology of deducing its PDF, some of its properties and related functions are discussed. The paper is supplied by many figures illustrating the new distribution and how this can make it illegible to fit a wide range of skewed data. The new distribution holds a name (Attia) as a nickname.</description>
