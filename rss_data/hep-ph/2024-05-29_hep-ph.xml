      <title>Photon self-energy at all temperatures and densities in all of phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an isotropic background comprised of free charges, the transverse and longitudinal modes of the photon acquire large corrections to their dispersion relations, described by the in-medium photon self-energy. Previous work has developed simple approximations that describe the propagation of on-shell photons in plasmas of varying temperatures and densities. However, off-shell excitations can also receive large medium-induced corrections, and the on-shell approximations have often been used in an effort to capture these effects. In this work we show that the off-shell self-energy can be qualitatively very different than the on-shell case. We develop analytic approximations that are accurate everywhere in phase space, especially in classical and degenerate plasmas. From these, we recover the on-shell expressions in the appropriate limit. Our expressions also reproduce the well-known Lindhard response function from solid-state physics for the longitudinal mode.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of $V_{ud}$ determinations from superallowed $\beta$ decays critically hinges on control over radiative corrections. Recently, substantial progress has been made on the single-nucleon, universal corrections, while nucleus-dependent effects, typically parameterized by a quantity $\delta_\text{NS}$, are much less well constrained. Here, we lay out a program to evaluate this correction from effective field theory (EFT), highlighting the dominant terms as predicted by the EFT power counting. Moreover, we compare the results to a dispersive representation of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and show that the expected momentum scaling applies even in the case of low-lying intermediate states. Our EFT framework paves the way towards ab-initio calculations of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and thereby addresses the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression for Beyond the Standard Model Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Catalyzed Baryon Destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WIMP-type dark matter may have additional interactions that break baryon number, leading to induced nucleon decays which are subject to direct experimental constraints from proton decay experiments. In this work, we analyze a possibility of continuous baryon destruction, deriving strong limits from the dark matter accumulating inside old neutron stars, as such a process leads to excess heat generation. We construct the simplest particle dark matter model that breaks baryon and lepton numbers separately but conserves $B-L$. Virtual exchange by DM particles in this model results in di-nucleon decay via $nn\to n\bar\nu$ and $np\to ne^+$ processes.</description>

      <title>Baryon number violation involving tauons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon number violation is our most sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model, especially through the study of nucleon decays. Angular momentum conservation requires a lepton in the final state of such decays, kinematically restricted to electrons, muons, or neutrinos. We show that operators involving tauons, which are at first sight too heavy to play a role in nucleon decays, still lead to clean nucleon decay channels with tau neutrinos. While many of them are already constrained from existing two-body searches such as $p\to \pi^+\nu$, other operators induce many-body decays such as $p \to \eta \pi^{+} \bar\nu_\tau$ and $n\to K^+ \pi^-\nu_\tau$ that have never been searched for.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to Kaon Decays to ALPs at Fixed Target Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of fixed target experiments to hadronically-coupled axion like particles (ALPs) produced in kaon decays, with a particular emphasis on current and upcoming short-baseline neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that below the kaon decay mass threshold ($m_a &lt; m_K - m_\pi$) kaon decay is the dominant production mechanism for ALPs at neutrino experiments, larger by many orders of magnitude than production in psuedo-scalar mixing. Such axions can be probed principally by the di-photon and di-muon final states. In the latter case, even if the axion does not couple to muons at tree level, such a coupling is induced by the renormalization group flow from the UV scale. We reinterpret prior results by CHARM and MicroBooNE through these channels and show that they constrain new areas of heavy axion parameter space. We also show projections of the sensitivity of the SBN and DUNE experiments to axions through these channels, which reach up to multiple decades higher in the axion decay constant beyond existing constraints. DUNE projects to have a sensitivity competitive with other world-leading upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Genuine LFUV observables in $\tau-\mu$ sector in $B \to (K,\,K^*) \ell \ell $ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was previously shown that unlike the ratios $R_K^{\mu e} \equiv R_K \equiv \Gamma(B \to K \mu^+ \mu^-)/\Gamma(B \to K e^+ e^-)$ and $R_{K^*}^{\mu e} \equiv R_{K^*} \equiv \Gamma(B \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-)/\Gamma(B \to K^* e^+ e^-)$, the ratios $R_K^{\tau \mu}$ and $R_{K^*}^{\tau \mu}$ can deviate from their Standard Model (SM) predictions even with universal new physics couplings. This observation highlights the critical need to identify and establish genuine lepton flavor universality violating (LFUV) observables in the $\tau-\mu$ sector. This work embarks on establishing genuine LFUV ratio observables in \(B \to K \ell \ell\) and \(B \to K^* \ell \ell\) decays through comprehensive analysis of their angular distributions. We find that like $R_{K^*}^{\tau \mu}$, the ratios $R_{A_{FB}}^{\tau \mu}$ and $R_{f_L}^{\tau \mu}$ do not qualify as genuine LFUV observables, whereas the ratios of all optimized observables in $B \to K^* \ell \ell$ decays within the $\tau-\mu$ sector definitively do. In the case of $B \to K \ell \ell$ decays, similar to $R_K^{\tau \mu}$, the ratio $R_{F_H}$ is influenced by mass effects and therefore cannot be considered a genuine LFUV observable in the $\tau-\mu$ sector. However, the ratio $\Gamma_\tau(1-F_{H}^{\tau})/\Gamma_\mu(1-F_{H}^{\mu})$ stands as the sole genuine LFUV observable in $B \to K \ell \ell$ decays. Furthermore, by making use of new physics Lorentz structures which provide a better fit to the current $b \to s \ell \ell$ data as compared to the SM, we demonstrate how the non-genuine LFU ratios $R_{A_{FB}}^{\tau \mu}$ and $R_{f_L}^{\tau \mu}$ can be employed to distinguish between framework with solely universal lepton couplings and those with both universal and non-universal couplings.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and linear holographic hard wall models for light unflavored mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider anomalous and linear holographic hard wall (HW) models for light unflavored mesons inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The anomalous dimensions depend on the logarithm of the spin $S$ of the meson state and come from a semiclassical analysis of gauge/string duality. The anomalous HW model produces very good masses and good Regge trajectories for mesons compared with PDG data. Inspired by this anomalous HW model we also propose a phenomenological modification of the dimension of the boundary operators such that the model produces asymptotic linear Regge trajectories.</description>

      <title>Monopoles and Fermions in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider all magnetic monopoles that could have settled in the Standard Model after descending from a generic microscopic theory. These monopoles have Standard Model quantum numbers, are stable, and we also require that their magnetic fluxes are consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking. Scattering processes involving quarks, leptons and protons on these monopoles are studied using partial waves decomposition. These processes in the lowest partial wave are known to be unsuppressed by the monopole mass and are relevant for monopole catalysis of proton decay. We provide estimates for scattering cross-sections and investigate and confirm the applicability of the twisted sector approach to scattering processes on these Standard Model monopoles.</description>

      <title>Locating Quark-Antiquark String Breaking in QCD through Chiral Symmetry Restoration and Hawking-Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between QCD and the string model offers a valuable perspective for exploring the interaction potential between quarks. In this study, we investigate the restoration of chiral symmetry in connection with the Unruh effect experienced by accelerating observers. Utilizing the Schwinger model, we analyze the critical point at which the string or chromoelectric flux tube between quark-antiquarks breaks with increasing separation between quarks. In this study, the critical distance for quark-antiquark chromoelectric flux tube or string breaking is determined to be $r_c=1.294\pm0.040$ fm. The acceleration and Unruh temperature corresponding to this critical point signify the transition of the system's chiral symmetry from a broken to a restored state. Our estimates for the critical acceleration ($a_c=1.14\times 10^{34}$ cm/s$^{2}$) and Unruh temperature ($T_c=0.038$ GeV) align with previous studies. This analysis illuminates the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration, the Unruh effect, and the breaking of the string or chromoelectric flux tube within the context of quark interactions.</description>

      <title>Two classes of Majorana neutrinos in the seesaw model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commonly used pseudo-C symmetry $(\nu_{L})^{c}=C\overline{\nu_{L}}^{T}$ is not defined in Lagrangian field theory. In general, there exist two classes of Majorana fermions; the first is associated with the chiral fermion with the conventional C and P symmetries, and the second is associated with the Weyl fermion defined by CP symmetry only and formally characterised by the pseudo-C symmetry. Taking the seesaw model as an example, it is shown that a generalized Pauli--G\"{u}rsey (or Bogoliubov-type) canonical transformation converts the neutrino defined by the Weyl fermion to the neutrino defined by the chiral fermion and thus to the conventional Majorana fermion, while preserving the anti-commutation relations. The mixing angles in the weak lepton sector are not modified by this generalized Pauli--G\"{u}rsey transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the realization of spontaneous CP violation through moduli stabilization. In modular flavor models, the source of CP violation is the vacuum expectation values of the complex structure moduli of toroidal compact space. We demonstrate that the combined effects of Type IIB flux compactifications with modular invariant couplings between the moduli and matter fields can induce spontaneous CP violation without or with supersymmetry breaking. Furthermore, some general properties of CP and modular invariant scalar potentials are presented. It is found that certain modifications or partial breakings of modular symmetry are useful in generating spontaneous CP violation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Exotic Decays of the Higgs Boson to Multi-Photons at the LHC via Multimodal Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, the most recently discovered elementary particle, may still serve as a mediator between the SM sector and a new physics sector related to dark matter (DM). The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has not yet fully constrained the physics associated with the Higgs boson, leaving room for such possibilities. Among the various potential mass scales of the dark sector, the sub-GeV mass range is particularly intriguing. This parameter space presents significant challenges for DM direct detection experiments that rely on nuclear recoils. Various innovative experimental methods are currently under investigation to explore this sub-GeV dark sector. The LHC, functioning as a Higgs factory, could explore this sector once the challenge of identifying DM signals is resolved. Due to the significantly lower mass of particles in the dark sector compared to the Higgs boson, these particles are expected to be highly boosted following the Higgs boson's decay. However, detecting and identifying these highly boosted particles remains a considerable challenge at the LHC, despite their eventual decay into SM particles. We employ a well-motivated leptophobic $Z^{\prime}_B$ model as a prototype to analyze the distinctive signatures from Higgs boson exotic decays into multi-photons. These signatures consist of collimated photons that fail to meet the photon isolation criteria, forming jet-like objects. Conventional analyses relying solely on the purity of energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter would fail to detect these signatures, as they would be overwhelmed by background events from Quantum Chromodynamics. To effectively distinguish between such novel signal signatures and SM background events, we leverage advanced machine learning techniques, specifically the transformer encoder in a multimodal network structure.</description>

      <title>Analytic NNLO QCD corrections to top quark pair production in electron-positron collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analytic total cross section of top quark pair production in electron-positron annihilation at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). By utilizing the optical theorem, the NNLO corrections are related to the imaginary parts of three-loop self-energy Feynman diagrams, of which the master integrals are calculated with canonical differential equations. The analytic results for the NNLO corrections are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms as well as elliptic functions. We discuss the asymptotic expansions near the threshold and in the high energy limit in detail. Numerical results are provided for the total cross section of top quark pair production at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>The Process $gg\to h^0 Z^{*}$ in the Inverted Hierarchy Scenario of the 2HDM Type-I at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While searching at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the production and decay of the CP-odd scalar ($A^0$) in the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) with Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) via the channels $gg\to A^0$ (through one-loop triangle diagrams) and $A^0\to h^0 Z^*$ (with $m_{h^0} =125$ GeV or $m_{h^0} &lt; 125$ GeV, with $Z$ off-shell), respectively, a factorisation of the two processes is normally performed, with the $A^0$ state being on-shell. While this approach is gauge-invariant, it is not capturing the presence of either of the following two channels: $gg\to Z^*\to h^0Z^*$ (through one-loop triangle diagrams) or $gg\to h^0Z^*$ (through one-loop box diagrams). As the resolution of the $A^0$ mass cannot be infinitely precise, we affirm that all such contributions should be computed simultaneously, whichever the $h^0$($Z^{*}$) decay(splitting) products, thereby including all possible interferences amongst themselves. The cross section of the ensuing complete process is significantly different from that obtained in the factorisation case, being of the order up to ten percent in either direction at the integrated level and larger (including changes in the shape of kinematical observables) at the differential level. We thus suggest that the complete calculation ought to be performed while searching for $A^0$ in this channel. We illustrate this need for the case of a 2HDM of Type-I in the inverted hierarchy scenario with $m_{h^0}&lt;125$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the work of Capstick and Isgur [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.34.2809}{Phys.~Rev.~D~34,~2809~(1986)}], we systematically study the mass spectrum of the heavy baryons in the relativized quark potential model with chromodynamics. Besides the original Godfrey-Isgur (GI) model, we also adopt a modified GI model which replaces the linear confinement by a screened one. The two models give similar results in our work. All heavy baryons observed so far can be explained as three-quark states. In particular, we identify the $\Omega_{c}(3000)$/$\Omega_{b}(6316)$, $\Omega_{c}(3050)$/$\Omega_{b}(6330)$, $\Omega_{c}(3065)$/$\Omega_{b}(6340)$ and $\Omega_{c}(3090)$/$\Omega_{b}(6350)$ states as the $p_{\lambda}$ excitations with quantum numbers $1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$. The $\Omega_{c}(3120)$ is a $3/2^{-}$ state with the $p_{\rho}$ excitation, whose bottom partner is predicted to be $\Omega_{b}(6446/6457,3/2^{-})$. The higher state $\Omega_{c}(3188)$ is the $2s_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $1/2^{+}$, and $\Omega_{c}(3327)$ is a $d_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $3/2^{+}$ or $5/2^{+}$. In addition, the $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ with quantum numbers $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ could be explained as the $p_{\rho}$ excitation.</description>

      <title>Triple-gauge couplings in LHC diboson production: a SMEFT view from every angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores fully leptonic WZ and WW production at the LHC within the SMEFT framework at NLO in QCD, focusing on both CP-even and CP-odd triple-gauge-coupling dimension-six operators. We investigate the off-shell processes, contrasting our findings in inclusive setups with those in the presence of realistic fiducial selections. Alongside the conventional kinematic observables, we examine polarisation-sensitive observables and angular coefficients. Moreover, we assess potential SMEFT effects on asymmetry observables. Through a sensitivity analysis, we identify critical LHC observables that are particularly sensitive to SMEFT-induced modifications, thereby shedding light on potential avenues for new-physics searches in diboson production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Impacts of ALP on the Constraints of Dark Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark sector may exist and interact with Standard Model (SM) through the $U(1)$ kinetic mixing. Through this portal-type interaction, dark photon from dark sector couples to SM fermions, and may explain the discrepancy between experimental data and SM calculations on muon anomalous magnetic moment, muon $g-2$. However, current searches for dark photon impose stringent constraints on the mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ for various dark photon masses, excluding the favorite parameter space for muon $g-2$. In this paper, we study the case where a global $U(1)$ in dark sector is spontaneously broken, resulting a light pseudo-Goldstone, axion-like particle (ALP) $a$, which couples to dark photon and SM photon, $g_{a\gamma\gamma'}$. Through this interaction, dark photon may decay into photon and ALP when this channel is kinematically allowed. As a result, the experimental constraints on dark photon change significantly, and dark photon is able to explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly when its mass is heavier than $10$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Transport model study of transverse momentum distributions of Pion, kaon, and (anti-)proton production in U+U collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 193 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra of $\pi ^{\pm }$, $k ^{\pm }$ and $p(\bar{p})$ in midrapidity ($\left | y \right | &lt; 0.1$) for nine centrality classes : $0-5\%$, $5-10\%$, $10-20\%$, $20-30\%$, $30-40\%$, $40-50\%$, $50-60\%$, $60-70\%$ and $70-80\%$ in $^{238} U$+$^{238} U$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=193 GeV are studied within the framework of the cascade and soft momentum dependent equation of state (SM-EoS) mode of the UrQMD model. Other extracted observables from $p_{T}$ spectra such as average transverse momentum ($\left \langle p_{T} \right \rangle$), particle yields ($dN/dy$) and particle ratios are also shown as functions of collision centrality. It is found that the U+U collision process is segmented. Before the collision centrality is $50-60\%$, the experimental data are described well using cascade mode when the $p_{T} &lt; 1.2 GeV/c$. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data using the SM-EoS mode at $p_{T} &gt; 1.2 GeV/c$. For the case of $60-80\%$ centrality, the SM-EoS mode describes the data better. Anti-particle to particle yield ratios indicating pair production is the dominant mechanism of particle production at RHIC energy.</description>

      <title>Towards the understanding of heavy quarks hadronization: from leptonic to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of hadrons is a fundamental process in nature that can be investigated at particle colliders. As several recent findings demonstrate, with \ensuremath{\mathrm{e^+e^-}}\xspace collisions as a "vacuum-like" reference at one extreme, and central AA as a dense, extended-size system characterized by flow and local equilibrium at the opposite extreme, different collision systems offer a lever arm that can be exploited to probe with a range of heavy-flavour hadron species the onset of various hadronization processes. In this review, we present an overview of the theoretical and experimental developments. The focus is on open-heavy-flavour measurements. The comparison with model predictions and connections among the results in electron-positron, proton--proton, proton--nucleus, nucleus--nucleus collisions are discussed. After reviewing the current state, we suggest some prospects and future developments.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Higgs spin and parity in $H\to \ell^-\ell^+ Z$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective and methodical algorithm for the construction of general covariant four-point $H\ell\ell Z$ vertices, accommodating leptons $\ell=e, \mu$, and designed to handle a Higgs boson $H$ of any integer spin, not merely confined to spins up to 2. While our numerical analysis assumes the Higgs boson mass to be $m_H=125\,{\rm GeV}$, the analytical framework we propose is versatile, enabling the examination of various mass scenarios. These meticulously devised general covariant four-point $H\ell\ell Z$ vertices are pivotal in the systematic determination of the spin and parity of the Standard Model Higgs boson, especially via one of its primary decay channels, the three-body decay process $H\to \ell^-\ell^+ Z$, observable at the Large Hadron Collider. Our innovative strategy extends beyond the limitations of previous investigations on the Higgs spin and parity determinations. It not only encompasses the analysis of the two-step cascade decay $H\to Z^{\star} Z \to \ell^-\ell^+ Z$, featuring an intermediate virtual $Z^{\star}$ exchange but also integrates consideration for the direct 4-point contact $H\ell\ell Z$ interaction. Our significantly expanded scheme provides a definitive and unequivocal platform for determining and confirming the spinless nature and even parity of the SM Higgs boson by leveraging threshold effects and angular correlations, even though achieving such conclusive results in practical and exhaustive analyses necessitates high event rates.</description>

      <title>Measuring differential particle correlations in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependencies of Symmetric and Asymmetric Correlations (SC and ASC) with one and two particles of interest in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Leveraging the AMPT model, the investigation delves into the sensitivity of these correlations to the final state effects, providing valuable insights into their potential for constraining the final state effects' $p_T$ dependencies. The HIJING model is employed as a benchmark for non-flow correlations, shedding light on their impact on interpreting SC and ASC data. Moreover, the study points out that differential SC and ASC with one and two particles of interest (POIs) typically incorporate contributions from event-plane angle fluctuations. Consequently, this work highlights the significance of SC and ASC with one and two POIs as valuable tools for investigating the $p_T$ nature of the final state effects and advocates for comprehensive experimental measurements across various beam energies and system sizes to enhance our understanding and provide additional constraints for theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discovery prospects for a charged Higgs boson via the $b g\to c H^- \to c \bar t b$ process at the Large Hadron Collier (LHC). Focusing on the general Two Higgs Doublet Model (G2HDM) that possesses extra Yukawa couplings, the process is controlled by extra top couplings $\rho_{tc}$ and $\rho_{tt}$, which can drive electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) to account for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU). We propose benchmark points (BPs) and demonstrate that evidence could emerge at the LHC with 14 TeV collision energy and luminosity of 300 fb$^{-1}$, with discovery potential at 600 fb$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Bottomed mesons and baryons in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5 \, TeV$ LHC energy within a Coalescence plus Fragmentation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental data from $pp$ collisions have shown a significant increase in heavy baryon production leading to a baryon over meson ratio which is one order of magnitude higher than elementary collisions ($e^+e^-$, $ep$). From a theoretical point of view this large production of baryon can be explained with hadronization via quark coalescence assuming a QGP medium in $pp$ collisions. In this study, we extend this analysis to include hadrons containing bottom quarks. Employing a coalescence plus fragmentation approach, we present predictions for $p_T$ spectra and the heavy baryon/meson ratio of charmed hadrons with and without strangeness content, specifically: $\bar{B^0}$, $B_s$, $\Lambda_b$, $\Xi_b^{0,-}$, $\Omega_b$, and the $B_c$ meson. We have found that coalescence is the dominant mechanism in the B meson production, especially at low momenta, at variance with what found in the charm sector where the D meson were mainly produced via fragmentation. Our model predicts a $\Lambda_b/\bar{B^0}\approx0.5\!-\!1$ and $\Xi_b^0/\bar{B^0}$ ratio around 0.3 at very low transverse momentum, which are about $1.5$ larger then those of the corresponding charmed hadron ratios at the same collision energy. Furthermore, we discuss the relative ratios between charmed and bottomed hadrons, emphasizing how these observables can provide information about the distribution of charm and bottom quarks and, if experimentally observed, would further support the idea of quark-gluon plasma formation even in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays and their impact on $V_{ud}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are essential for an accurate determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed $\beta$ decays. In view of recent progress in the single-nucleon sector, the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical description of nucleus-dependent effects, limiting the precision that can currently be achieved for $V_{ud}$. In this work, we provide a detailed account of the electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory (EFT), including the power counting, potential and ultrasoft contributions, and factorization in the decay rate. We present a first numerical evaluation of the dominant corrections in light nuclei based on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, confirming the expectations from the EFT power counting. Finally, we discuss strategies how to extract from data the low-energy constants that parameterize short-distance contributions and whose values are not predicted by the EFT. Combined with advances in ab-initio nuclear-structure calculations, this EFT framework allows one to systematically address the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$, as illustrated in detail for the $^{14}$O $\to$ $^{14}$N transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a covariant method of constructing entire trajectories of physical states in superstring theory in the critical dimension. It is inspired by a recently developed covariant technology of excavating bosonic string trajectories, that is facilitated by the observation that the Virasoro constraints can be written as linear combinations of lowering operators of a bigger algebra, namely a symplectic algebra, which is Howe dual to the spacetime Lorentz algebra. For superstrings, it is the orthosymplectic algebra that appears instead, with its lowest weight states forming the simplest class of physical trajectories in the NS sector. To construct the simplest class in the R sector, the lowest weight states need to be supplemented with other states, which we determine. Deeper trajectories are then constructed by acting with suitable combinations of the raising operators of the orthosymplectic algebra, which we illustrate with several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

Abstract: Spatial structuring of materials at subwavelength scales underlies the concept of metamaterials possessing exotic properties beyond those of the constituent media. Temporal modulation of material parameters enables further functionalities. Here, we show that high-frequency oscillations of spatially uniform magnetization generate an effective dynamic axion field embedding the amplitude and phase of magnetization oscillations. This allows one to map ultrafast magnetization dynamics using a probe signal with much lower frequency.</description>

Abstract: We report the first ab initio calculation of the nuclear-structure-dependent radiative correction $ \delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } $ to the $ {}^{10}\mathrm{C} \rightarrow {}^{10}\mathrm{B} $ superallowed transition, computed with the no-core shell model and chiral effective field theory. We obtain $\delta_{ \mathrm{NS} } = - 0.400 (29)_{ \mathrm{nuc} } (12)_{n,\mathrm{el} } $ with a $1.7$-times reduction in the nuclear uncertainty when compared to the current literature estimate based on the shell model and Fermi gas picture. This work paves the way for a precise determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed beta decays.</description>

Abstract: In this study, computational analysis of neutral Higgs bosons $h$, $H$ and $A$ is carried out within the parameter space of Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) type-I in exact alignment limit of $\sin{(\beta - \alpha)} = 1$ at compact linear collider. Assuming Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) scenario where the electron-positron beams will be collided at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.5 TeV. Two different values of predicted integrated luminosities are used in our calculations, 1000 $fb^{-1}$ and 2500 $fb^{-1}$. Three signal processes $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Zhh \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$, $e^+ e^- \rightarrow ZHH \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $e^+ e^- \rightarrow Zhh \rightarrow jjb\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ are selected for analysis. The polarized colliding beams are used to enhance the signal production cross-section. Low $\tan{\beta}$ and equal Higgs masses regime is chosen in favor of Hadronic decay of $Z$ boson and $H \rightarrow b\bar{b}$. Different signal scenarios are selected and event generation is performed for each process separately. The $W$ and $Z$ boson, as well as top quark backgrounds are analyzed. Signal significance is computed at each Higgs mass hypothesis for three signal processes. After a comprehensive study, we did not find sizeable amount of signal events on top of the background but still, signal significance is found to be larger than 1, without taking into account the detector effects and systematics. The maximum calculated value of signal significance is observed to lie in the range of 150 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 250 GeV for $Zhh$ while for $ZHH$ the range is 175 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 200 GeV at 1000 $fb^{-1}$ and 175 $\leq$ $m_H$ $\leq$ 225 GeV region at 2500 $fb^{-1}$. Similarly, for $ZAA$ process, the significance is highest at $m_A$ = 175 GeV for both 1000 and 2500 $fb^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Global fit to $b \to c\tau\nu$ anomalies 2022 mid-autumn</title>

Abstract: Recently, the LHCb collaboration announced a preliminary result of the test of lepton flavor universality (LFU) in $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ semi-leptonic decays: $R_{D}^{\rm LHCb2022} = 0.441 \pm 0.089$ and $R_{D^{\ast}}^{\rm LHCb2022} = 0.281 \pm 0.030$ based on the LHC Run 1 data. This is the first result of $R_{D}$ for the LHCb experiment, and its precision is comparable to the other $B$-factory data. Interestingly, those data prefer the violation of the LFU again. A new world average of the data from the BaBar, Belle, and LHCb collaborations is $R_{D} = 0.358 \pm 0.027$ and $R_{D^{\ast}} = 0.285 \pm 0.013$. Including this new data, we update a circumstance of the $b \to c \tau \overline\nu$ measurements and their implications for new physics. Incorporating recent developments for the $B \to D^{(\ast)}$ form factors in the Standard Model (SM), we observe a $4.1 \sigma$ deviation from the SM predictions. Our updates also include; model-independent new physics (NP) formulae for the related observables; and the global fittings of parameters for leptoquark scenarios as well as single NP operator scenarios. Furthermore, we show future potential to indirectly distinguish different new physics scenarios with the use of the precise measurements of the polarization observables in $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau \overline\nu$ at the Belle II and the high-$p_{\rm T}$ flavored-tail searches at the LHC. We also discuss an impact on the LFU violation in $\Upsilon \to l^+ l^-$.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the impact of the recent LHCb update on the two lepton-flavour universality ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$, and the CMS update of $B({B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-})$ regarding the possibility of New Physics in $b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ decays. We perform global fits of the New Physics Wilson coefficients defined in the model-independent approach of the Weak Effective Theory at the $b$-quark mass. We discuss three different frameworks for this analysis: i) an update limited to the experimental data using the same theoretical framework as in earlier works, ii) a full update concerning both the experimental inputs and the theoretical framework, iii) an analysis without the LHCb results on electron modes. The comparison between these sets of results allows us to identify the differences stemming from the various components of the analysis: new experimental results, new inputs for the hadronic form factors, the role played by LHCb data on electron modes. As expected, the significance of all New Physics hypotheses gets reduced after the LHCb announcements on $R_{K^{(\ast)}}$ while the hypothesis of a lepton-flavour-universal contribution to the Wilson coefficient of the semileptonic $O_{9\ell}$ operators (possibly with a very small lepton-flavour-universality violating component) is reinforced. We also discuss the possibility of a long-distance charm-loop contribution through a mode-by-mode analysis and we find that the preferred values for the $\mathcal{C}_{9\mu}$ Wilson coefficient are consistent throughout the different $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ modes and that there is no significant evidence of non-constant $q^2$ dependencies, which would indicate the presence of a long-distance charm-loop contribution beyond those already included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the charged-current Higgs boson production process at future electron-proton colliders, $e^-p \to H j \nu_e$, with the subsequent decay of the Higgs boson into a $b\bar{b}$ pair, to probe the Standard Model effective field theory with dimension-six operators involving the Higgs boson and the bottom quark. The study is performed for two proposed future high-energy electron-proton colliders, the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC) and the Future Circular Collider (FCC-he) at the center-of-mass energies of 1.3 TeV and 3.46 TeV, respectively. Constraints on the CP-even and CP-odd $Hb\bar{b}$ couplings are derived by analyzing the simulated signal and background samples. A realistic detector simulation is performed and a multivariate technique using the gradient Boosted Decision Trees algorithm is employed to discriminate the signal from background. Expected limits are obtained at $95\%$ Confidence Level for the LHeC and FCC-he assuming the integrated luminosities of 1, 2 and 10 ab$^{-1}$. We find that using 1 ab$^{-1}$ of data, the CP-even and CP-odd $Hb\bar{b}$ couplings can be constrained with accuracies of the order of $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-2}$, respectively, and a significant region of the unprobed parameter space becomes accessible.</description>

      <title>Different versions of soft-photon theorems exemplified at leading and next-to-leading terms for pion-pion and pion-proton scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the photon emission in pion-pion and pion-proton scattering in the soft-photon limit where the photon energy $\omega \to 0$. The expansions of the $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ and the $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p \gamma$ amplitudes, satisfying the energy-momentum relations, to the orders $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^{0}$ are derived. We show that these terms can be expressed completely in terms of the on-shell amplitudes for $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0}$ and $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$, respectively, and their partial derivatives with respect to $s$ and $t$. The~structure term which is non singular for $\omega \to 0$ is determined to the order $\omega^{0}$ from the gauge-invariance constraint using the generalized Ward identities for pions and the proton. For the reaction $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ we discuss in detail the soft-photon theorems in the versions of both F.E. Low and S. Weinberg. We show that these two versions are different and must not be confounded. Weinberg's version gives the pole term of a Laurent expansion in $\omega$ of the amplitude for $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ around the phase-space point of zero radiation. Low's version gives an approximate expression for the above amplitude at a fixed phase-space point, corresponding to non-zero radiation. Clearly, the leading and next-to-leading terms in theses two approaches must be, and are indeed, different. We show their relation. We also discuss the expansions of differential cross sections for $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ with respect to $\omega$ for $\omega \to 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logarithm of the soft function can be organized into sets of Feynman diagrams known as Cwebs. We introduced a new formalism in~\cite{Agarwal:2022wyk}, that allows to determine several of the building blocks of Cweb mixing matrices without explicit computations. In~\cite{Agarwal:2022xec} we used this formalism to obtain the diagonal blocks of four general classes of Cwebs to all orders in perturbation theory which also covered all the four loop Boomerang Cwebs connecting four Wilson lines. In this work we present complete mixing matrices and exponentiated colour factors for Boomerang Cwebs at four loops that connect three and four Wilson lines. Also, we present a more efficient version of the algorithm of generating Cwebs that was presented in~\cite{Agarwal:2020nyc}. This new algorithm has been used to generate the Cwebs in the present work.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis through Asymmetric Reheating in the Mirror Twin Higgs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the $\nu\phi$MTH, a Mirror Twin Higgs (MTH) model realizing asymmetric reheating, baryogenesis and twin-baryogenesis through the out-of-equilibrium decay of a right-handed neutrino without any hard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking. The MTH is the simplest Neutral Naturalness solution to the little hierarchy problem and predicts the existence of a twin dark sector related to the Standard Model (SM) by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is only softly broken by a higher twin Higgs vacuum expectation value. The asymmetric reheating cools the twin sector compared to the visible one, thus evading cosmological bounds on $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. The addition of (twin-)colored scalars allows for the generation of the visible baryon asymmetry and, by the virtue of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, also results in the generation of a twin baryon asymmetry. We identify a unique scenario with top-philic couplings for the new scalars that can satisfy all cosmological, proton decay and LHC constraints; yield the observed SM baryon asymmetry; and generate a wide range of possible twin baryon DM fractions, from negligible to unity. The viable regime of the theory contains several hints as to the possible structure of the Twin Higgs UV completion. Our results motivate the search for the rich cosmological and astrophysical signatures of twin baryons, and atomic dark matter more generally, at cosmological, galactic and stellar scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on dark matter annihilation using 14 years of publicly available Fermi-LAT data from a set of 54 dwarf spheroidal galaxies, using spectral information from 16 energy bins. We perform this analysis using our updated and publicly available code MADHATv2, which can be used to test a variety of models for dark matter particle physics and astrophysics in an accessible manner. In particular, we note that including Carina III in the analysis strengthens constraints on $s$-wave annihilation into two-body Standard Model final states by a factor of $\sim 3$ but broadens the error on the constraint due to the large uncertainty of its $J$-factor. Our findings illustrate the importance of verifying if Carina III is in fact a dwarf spheroidal galaxy and measuring more precisely its $J$-factor. More generally, they highlight the significance of forthcoming discoveries of nearby ultra-faint dwarfs for dark matter indirect detection.</description>

Abstract: Triggered by the observation of four top-quark production at the LHC by the ATLAS and CMS collaboration we report on the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the Standard Model process $pp \to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ in the $4\ell$ top-quark decay channel. We take into account higher-order QCD effects in both the production and decays of the four top quarks. The latter effects are treated in the narrow width approximation, which preserves top-quark spin correlations throughout the calculation. We present results for two selected renormalisation and factorisation scale settings and three different PDF sets. Furthermore, we study the main theoretical uncertainties that are associated with the neglected higher-order terms in the perturbative expansion and with the parameterisation of the PDF sets. The results at the integrated and differential fiducial cross-section level are shown for the LHC Run III center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV. Our findings are particularly relevant for precise measurements of the four top-quark fiducial cross sections and for the modelling of top-quark decays at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: Semi-inclusive hadron production processes in deep-inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering are important probes of the quark flavour structure of the nucleon and of the fragmentation dynamics of quarks into hadrons. We compute the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the coefficient functions for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) in analytical form. The numerical impact of these corrections for precision physics is illustrated by a detailed comparison with data on single inclusive hadron spectra from the CERN COMPASS experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations are typically studied using the lowest-order quantum kinetic equation, also known as the mean-field approximation. However, some recent quantum many-body simulations suggest that quantum entanglement among neutrinos may be important and may result in flavor equilibration of the neutrino gas. In this work, we develop new quantum models for neutrino gases in which any pair of neutrinos can interact at most once in their lifetimes. A key parameter of our models is $\gamma=\mu \Delta z$, where $\mu$ is the neutrino coupling strength, which is proportional to the neutrino density, and $\Delta z$ is the duration over which a pair of neutrinos can interact each time. Our models reduce to the mean-field approach in the limit $\gamma\to0$ and achieve flavor equilibration in time $t \gg (\gamma\mu)^{-1}$. These models demonstrate the emergence of coherent flavor oscillations from the particle perspective and may help elucidate the role of quantum entanglement in collective neutrino oscillations.</description>

Abstract: We consider top-antitop quark $(t{\bar t})$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with subsequent decays into dileptonic final states. We use and investigate a set of leptonic angular correlations and distributions with which all the independent coefficient functions of the top-spin dependent parts of the $t{\bar t}$ production spin density matrices can be experimentally probed. We compute these observables for the LHC center-of-mass energy 13.6 TeV within the Standard Model at next-to-leading order in the QCD coupling including the mixed QCD-weak corrections. We determine also the $t{\bar t}$ charge asymmetry where we take in addition also the mixed QCD-QED corrections into account. In addition we analyze and compute possible new physics (NP) effects on these observables in terms of a gauge-invariant effective Lagrangian that contains the operators up to mass dimension six that are relevant for hadronic $(t{\bar t})$ production. First we compute our observables inclusive in phase space. In order to investigate which region in phase space has, for a specific observable, a high NP sensitivity, we determine our observables also in two-dimensional $(M_{t{\bar t}},\cos\theta_t^*)$ bins, where $M_{t{\bar t}}$ denotes the $t{\bar t}$ invariant mass and $\theta_t^*$ is the top-quark scattering angle in the $t{\bar t}$ zero-momentum frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider (ILC) will allow the precise study of $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow q\bar{q}$ interactions at different center-of-mass energies from the $Z$-pole to 1 TeV. In this paper, we discuss the experimental prospects for measuring differential observables in $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}\rightarrow c\bar{c}$ at the ILC baseline energies, 250 and 500 GeV. The study is based on full simulation and reconstruction of the International Large Detector (ILD) concept. Two gauge-Higgs unification models predicting new high-mass resonances beyond the Standard Model are discussed. These models predict sizable deviations of the forward-backward observables at the ILC running above the $Z$ mass and with longitudinally polarized electron and positron beams. The ability of the ILC to probe these models via high-precision measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry is discussed. Alternative scenarios at other energies and beam polarization schemes are also discussed, extrapolating the estimated uncertainties from the two baseline scenarios.</description>

      <title>Causal third-order viscous hydrodynamics within relaxation-time approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we derive a linearly stable and causal theory of relativistic third-order viscous hydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation with relaxation-time approximation. We employ viscous correction to the distribution function obtained using a Chapman-Enskog like iterative solution of the Boltzmann equation. Our derivation highlights the necessity of incorporating a new dynamical degree of freedom, specifically an irreducible tensors of rank three, within this framework. This differs from the recent formulation of causal third-order theory from the method of moments which requires two dynamical degrees of freedom: an irreducible third-rank and a fourth-rank tensor. We verify the linear stability and causality of the proposed formulation by examining perturbations around a global equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Improved analysis of the decay width of $t\to Wb$ up to N$^{3}$LO QCD corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the top-quark decay $t\to Wb$ up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^{3}$LO) QCD corrections. For the purpose, we first adopt the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) to deal with the initial pQCD series. Then we adopt the Bayesian analysis approach, which quantifies the unknown higher-order terms' contributions in terms of a probability distribution, to estimate the possible magnitude of the uncalculated N$^{4}$LO-terms. In our calculation, an effective strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}(Q_{*})$ is determined by using all non-conformal $\{\beta_{i}\}$ terms associated with the renormalization group equation. This leads to a next-to-leading-log PMC scale $Q_{*}^{(\rm NLL)}=10.3048$ GeV, which can be regarded as the correct momentum flow of the process. Consequently, we obtain an improved scale-invariant pQCD prediction for the top-quark decay width, e.g. $\Gamma_{t}^{\rm tot} = 1.3120 \pm 0.0038$ GeV, whose error is the squared average of the uncertainties from the decay width of $W$-boson $\Delta \Gamma_{W} = \pm 0.042$ GeV, the coupling constant $\Delta \alpha_{s}(m_{Z}) = \pm 0.0009$, and the predicted N$^{4}$LO-terms. The magnitude of the top-quark pole mass greatly affects the total decay width. By further taking the PDG top-quark pole mass error from cross-section measurements into consideration, e.g. $\Delta m_{t} = \pm 0.7$ GeV, we obtain $\Gamma_{t}^{\rm tot} = 1.3120 ^{+0.0194}_{-0.0192}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlos for tau lepton -- Standard Model and New Physics signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of purposes for High Energy accelerator experiments is confrontation of theory and measurements in ever new realms. Any new agreement extends theory applicability domain, any discrepancy hints to unexplained. That calls for better calculations or new, deeper theory. Often one has to search for small contributions over large Standard Model background. Multi-dimensional signatures and complex background subtraction cuts imply that Monte Carlo techniques are indispensable.

      <title>Constraining vector dark matter and dark photon with degenerate mass in a hidden local SU(2) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss degenerate vector dark matter and dark photon that are induced from hidden $SU(2)_H$ gauge sector where it is spontaneously broken by vacuum expectation value of $SU(2)_H$ doublet. Kinetic mixing between $SU(2)_H$ and $U(1)_Y$ gauge fields can be generated by introducing dimension six operator realizing dark photon interactions. In estimating relic density we focus on the process in which dark matter annihilates into dark photons, and search for the region of dark matter mass and gauge coupling realizing observed relic density. We then discuss constraints from dark photon physics, thermalization of dark sector and direct detection of dark matter. It is then found that constraints from direct detection experiments give us the strongest upper limits on the dark photon interactions.</description>

      <title>Endothermic self-interacting dark matter in Milky Way-like dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) offers the potential to mitigate some of the discrepancies between simulated cold dark matter (CDM) and observed galactic properties. We introduce a physically motivated SIDM model to understand the effects of self interactions on the properties of Milky Way and dwarf galaxy sized haloes. This model consists of dark matter with a nearly degenerate excited state, which allows for both elastic and inelastic scattering. In particular, the model includes a significant probability for particles to up-scatter from the ground state to the excited state. We simulate a suite of zoom-in Milky Way-sized N-body haloes with six models with different scattering cross sections to study the effects of up-scattering in SIDM models. We find that the up-scattering reaction greatly increases the central densities of the main halo through the loss of kinetic energy. However, the physical model still results in significant coring due to the presence of elastic scattering and down-scattering. These effects are not as apparent in the subhalo population compared to the main halo, but the number of subhaloes is reduced compared to CDM.</description>

      <title>Complete analysis of the background and anisotropies of scalar-induced gravitational waves: primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ considered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigation of primordial non-Gaussianity holds immense importance in testing the inflation paradigm and shedding light on the physics of the early Universe. In this study, we conduct the complete analysis of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) by incorporating the local-type non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$. We develop Feynman-like diagrammatic technique and derive semi-analytic formulas for both the energy-density fraction spectrum and the angular power spectrum. For the energy-density fraction spectrum, we analyze all the relevant Feynman-like diagrams, determining their contributions to the spectrum in an order-by-order fashion. As for the angular power spectrum, our focus lies on the initial inhomogeneities, giving rise to anisotropies in SIGWs, that arise from the coupling between short- and long-wavelength modes due to primordial non-Gaussianity. Our analysis reveals that this spectrum exhibits a typical multipole dependence, characterized by $\tilde{C}_{\ell}\propto[\ell(\ell+1)]^{-1}$, which plays a crucial role in distinguishing between different sources of gravitational waves. Depending on model parameters, significant anisotropies can be achieved. We also show that the degeneracies in model parameters can be broken. The findings of our study underscore the angular power spectrum as a robust probe for investigating primordial non-Gaussianity and the physics of the early Universe. Moreover, our theoretical predictions can be tested using space-borne gravitational-wave detectors and pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Double parton scattering versus jet quenching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel observable, the double nuclear modification factor, is proposed to probe simultaneously the initial and final state effects in nucleus-nucleus collisions. An interesting competition between the combinatorial enhancement in the double parton scattering and the suppression due to parton energy loss can be observed in the production rate of two hard particles. In particular, the production of $J/\psi$ mesons in association with a $W$ boson is not suppressed but is enhanced in the region of moderate transverse momenta, unlike the case of unassociated (inclusive) $J/\psi$ production. At the same time, in the region of high enough transverse momenta the nuclear modification factor for associated $J/\psi+W$ production converges to that of unassociated $J/\psi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of an additional dimension, as proposed in Kaluza-Klein's theory, on the Casimir effect within the context of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which is represented by the ``aether field''. We demonstrate that the Casimir energy is directly influenced by the presence of the fifth dimension, as well as by the aether parameter. Consequently, the force between the plates is also subject to variations of these parameters. Furthermore, we examine constraints on both the size of the extra dimension and the aether field parameter based on experimental data. The LIV parameter can provide insights into addressing the size-related challenges in Kaluza-Klein's theory and offers a mean to establish an upper limit on the size of the extra dimension. This helps to rationalize the difficulties associated with its detection in current experiments.</description>

      <title>Varying primordial state fractions in exo- and endothermic SIDM simulations of Milky Way-mass haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is increasingly studied as a potential solution to small-scale discrepancies between simulations of cold dark matter (CDM) and observations. We examine a physically motivated two-state SIDM model with both elastic and inelastic scatterings. In particular, endothermic, exothermic, and elastic scattering occur with equal probability at high relative velocities ($v_{\rm rel}\gtrsim400~{\rm km/s})$. In a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulation of Milky Way-size haloes, we vary the primordial state fractions to understand the impact of inelastic dark matter self-interactions on halo structure and evolution. In particular, we test how the initial conditions impact the present-day properties of dark matter haloes. Depending on the primordial state fraction, scattering reactions will be dominated by either exothermic or endothermic effects for high and low initial excited state fractions respectively. We find that increasing the initial excited fraction reduces the mass of the main halo, as well as the number of subhaloes on all mass scales. The main haloes are cored, with lower inner densities and higher outer densities compared with CDM. Additionally, we find that the shape of the main halo becomes more spherical the higher the initial excited state fraction is. Finally, we show that the number of satellites steadily decreases with initial excited state fraction across all satellite masses.</description>

      <title>Novel Signatures of Radiation Reaction in Electron-Laser Sidescattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate novel signatures of radiation reaction via the angular deflection of an electron beam colliding at 90 degrees with an intense laser pulse. Due to the radiation reaction effect, the electrons can be deflected towards the beam axis for plane wave backgrounds, which is not possible in the absence of radiation reaction effects. The magnitude and size of the deflection angle can be controlled by tailoring the laser pulse shapes. The effect is first derived analytically using the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which allows to determine the important scaling behavior with laser intensity and particle energy. We then move on to full scale 3D Monte Carlo simulations to verify the effect is observable with present day laser technology. We investigate the opportunities for an indirect observation of laser depletion in such side scattering scenarios.</description>
