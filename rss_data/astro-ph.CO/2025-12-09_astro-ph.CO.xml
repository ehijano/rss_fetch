      <title>The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha intensity mapping of cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) has garnered attention as a powerful cosmological probe, with next-generation instruments such as SPHEREx preparing to map the evolution of large-scale structure during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k &gt; 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is ~4 orders of magnitude lower--providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes.</description>

      <title>Generalized tension metrics for multiple cosmological datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel estimator to quantify statistical tensions among multiple cosmological datasets simultaneously. This estimator generalizes the Difference-in-Means statistic, $Q_{\rm DM}$, to the multi-dataset regime. Our framework enables the detection of dominant tension directions in the shared parameter space. It further provides a geometric interpretation of the tension for the two- and three-dataset cases in two dimensions. According to this approach, the previously reported increase in tension between DESI and Planck from $1.9\sigma$ (DR1) to $2.3\sigma$(DR2) is reinterpreted as a more modest shift from $1.18\sigma^{\rm eff}$ (DR1) to $1.45\sigma^{\rm eff}$ (DR2). These new tools may also prove valuable across research fields where dataset discrepancies arise.</description>

      <title>Black hole merger rates for LISA and LGWA from semi-analytical modelling of light seeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the upcoming space- and Moon-based gravitational-wave detectors, LISA and LGWA respectively, a new era of GW astronomy will begin with the possibility of detections of the mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($&gt;10^5 M_\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a "light" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create "pessimistic" and "optimistic" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs. Joint observations will probe the full BH mass spectrum and constrain BH formation and seeding models.</description>

      <title>The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS): X-ray stacking analysis of Subaru's optically selected clusters spanning low richness regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series exploring the X-ray properties of galaxy clusters optically selected by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey, using data from the SRG/eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS). We aim to investigate scaling relations between observable cluster properties and mass, and to study the radial X-ray profiles of a large sample of optically selected clusters. We analyze a sample of 997 CAMIRA clusters with richness $N &gt; 15$ and redshifts of $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.3$. Using bolometric luminosities derived from count rates and a weak-lensing mass calibration, we study the $L-M$ and $N-M$ scaling relations through stacking analysis, while accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution. We also compare clusters with and without X-ray counterparts in the eFEDS catalog in terms of their scaling relations and surface brightness profiles. The best-fit $L-M$ slope ($1.56^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) is slightly steeper than the self-similar prediction, yet remains consistent with our previous findings. The $N-M$ slope ($0.766^{+0.070}_{-0.060}$) broadly agrees with theoretical expectations and other optical samples. The data do not require any additional redshift evolution beyond the standard self-similar scaling, although current constraints on evolution remain weak. X-ray detected clusters exhibit a steeper $L-M$ slope, higher central surface brightness, and more centrally concentrated X-ray profiles than undetected systems. Our results highlight systematic differences in the X-ray properties between optically and X-ray selected cluster samples. This study extends scaling relation analyses into lower mass and luminosity regimes, demonstrating the value of combining deep X-ray and optical surveys like eROSITA and Subaru HSC.</description>

      <title>A Fully Photometric Approach to Type Ia Supernova Cosmology in the LSST Era: Host Galaxy Redshifts and Supernova Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to discover nearly a million Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), offering an unprecedented opportunity to constrain dark energy. The vast majority of these events will lack spectroscopic classification and redshifts, necessitating a fully photometric approach to maximize cosmology constraining power. We present detailed simulations based on the Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), and a cosmological analysis using photometrically classified SNeIa with host galaxy photometric redshifts. This dataset features realistic multi-band light curves, non-SNIa contamination, host mis-associations, and transient-host correlations across the high-redshift Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) (~ 50 deg^2). We also include a spectroscopically confirmed low-redshift sample based on the Wide Fast Deep (WFD) fields. We employ a joint SN+host photometric redshift fit, a neural network based photometric classifier (SCONE), and BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) methodology to construct a bias-corrected Hubble diagram. We produce statistical + systematic covariance matrices, and perform cosmology fitting with a prior using Cosmic Microwave Background constraints. We fit and present results for the wCDM dark energy model, and the more general Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) w0wa model. With a simulated sample of ~6000 events, we achieve a Figure of Merit (FoM) value of about 150, which is significantly larger than the DESVYR FoM of 54. Averaging analysis results over 25 independent samples, we find small but significant biases indicating a need for further analysis testing and development.</description>

      <title>Testing the Distance Duality Relation with Cosmological Observations at high Redshift using Artificial Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic Distance Duality Relation (DDR) is a fundamental prediction of metric gravity under photon number conservation. In this work, we perform a model-independent test of the DDR using Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SN Ia), \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the FULL and GOLD samples, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing (SGL) system samples at high redshift $0.01 &lt; z \lesssim 8$ using an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. Our results show that the standard DDR is consistent with cosmological observations at high redshift within the $\sim 2 \sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Angular BAO Forecasts for the IBIS Medium-Band Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ongoing and near-future spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, DESI-II and Spec-S5, rely on imaging-based selections to construct uniform, three-dimensional tracers of large-scale structure. While spectroscopic data from these surveys constrain the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature with high precision, the imaging surveys used for target selection can provide useful information on the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. In this work we explore the feasibility of angular BAO measurements for the Intermediate-Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) using recent constraints on clustering from a pilot survey spanning $2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5$. Through Fisher forecasts, we find that a 5000 deg$^2$ survey of LAEs with realistic bias, a tracer density of $2\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^3$ and interloper fraction $f_{\rm int}=10\%$ can constrain the BAO dilation parameter $\alpha$ at $z_{\rm eff}=2.8$ with a precision of 2.6\%, with dependence on the sample properties that is consistent with shot noise-dominated measurements. We then explore medium-band survey specifications for the planned Stage-V Spectroscopic Instrument (Spec-S5) and beyond, demonstrating the potential for precise high-redshift BAO measurements. Our forecasts motivate early measurements of BAO from these imaging surveys, which may inform later spectroscopic analyses.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Magnetism with Rotation Measure-Squared-Galaxy Cross-Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for extracting information about cosmic magnetic fields using cross-correlations between extragalactic Faraday rotation measure (RM) catalogs and galaxy surveys. Specifically, we propose measuring the two-point cross-correlation between RM squared, ${\rm RM}^2$, towards background sources and the projected density field of foreground galaxies, $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$, as a function of transverse separation. This statistic is analogous to the ''projected fields'' estimator used for the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, $\langle {\rm kSZ}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$. Our estimator avoids contamination, and is also free from the noise bias that arises when correlating the absolute value of the RMs with galaxies. Moreover, by binning in foreground galaxy redshifts, $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ enables a tomographic reconstruction of the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. We model this statistic using the Illustris-TNG cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations and compare with approximate analytic predictions. We show that $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ can be related to a bispectrum involving two copies of the electron-density--weighted magnetic field strength and one of the galaxy overdensity. In Illustris-TNG, the effective field strength is primarily set by the magnetic field amplitudes within the inner regions of galaxy-hosting dark matter halos. It increases towards low redshift, driven by dynamo amplification and magnetized outflows. Our forecasts suggest that $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ is detectable at high significance with current galaxy surveys and future RM catalogs from the SKA, offering a tomographic probe of large-scale magnetic fields across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>What Galaxy Clusters Have to Say About Dynamical Dark Energy and $H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in flat $\Lambda$CDM, low-redshift structure probes -- cluster abundances, 3$\times$2-point analyses, and full-shape clustering -- are mutually consistent, jointly delivering precise constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ that agree with geometrical datasets (CMB+BAO+SN). In $w_0w_a$CDM, adding clusters to the geometry dataset reduces the evidence for evolving dark energy while relaxing the $H_0$ tension, suggesting a $\Lambda$CDM evolution of the late-time Universe and a sound horizon that differs from its standard value.</description>

      <title>An Extended WZDR Model with Interacting Scalar Field Dark Matter and Stepped Dark Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the interaction between scalar field dark matter and stepped dark radiation as an extension of the WZDR model. The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\log_{10}(\xi)&lt;4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.</description>

      <title>Probing memory-burdened Primordial Black Holes with global 21 cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the imprints of memory-burdened primordial black holes (PBH) on the global 21 cm signal during the cosmic dawn. Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\text {PBH}}&lt; 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $\delta=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{7}$ g.</description>

      <title>Core-halo scaling relations in self-interacting scalar field dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of self-interactions on the structure and evolution of scalar field dark matter (SFDM) halos. Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the late-time imprints of three dark energy (DE) models, namely, the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, and an Omnipotent DE model, on cosmological observables sensitive to the time evolution of gravitational potentials. While CPL serves as a reference parameterization, the Omnipotent and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenarios were originally proposed as possible solutions to the $H_0$ tension and are selected here because they can yield negative dark energy. These models are examined within a multi-probe framework based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the lensing-ISW bispectrum. By analyzing both two- and three-point Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) correlations, we assess how their late-time dynamics modify the growth and decay of large-scale gravitational potentials compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Despite producing nearly indistinguishable CMB angular spectra at high multipoles, these models yield distinctive signatures in the low-$\ell$ ISW plateau as well as in higher-order statistics related to ISW, highlighting the power of both large-scale CMB anisotropies and higher-order CMB statistics in testing dark energy physics. Our results demonstrate that combining complementary ISW probes provides an effective way to discriminate between dark energy scenarios and will be crucial to determine whether negative or sign-switching dark energy is ultimately favored or disfavored by forthcoming data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy in light of DESI BAO and Full-Shape Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07104v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the DESI BAO data has reported a preference of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over the \LambdaCDM cosmology. Apart from the BAO data, the DDE model should be also sensitive to low-redshift measurements of the matter power spectrum data. In this study, we address this point by combining the DESI Y1 data about the matter power spectrum, extracted from the DESI Full-Shape data, with the DESI DR2 BAO data among other probes. After building the DESI Y1 likelihood, we carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, showing that the constraints on $w_0$ and $w_a$ with DESI Y1 data included are improved over those without it for three different datasets widely considered, especially in the case of the DESY5 sample.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformers for Cosmological Fields: Application to Weak Lensing Mass Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of the universe's growth history. While traditional two-point statistics capture only the Gaussian features of the convergence field, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in extracting non-Gaussian information from small-scale, nonlinear structures. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of attention-based architectures, including variants of vision transformers (ViTs) and shifted window (Swin) transformers, in constraining the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$ from weak lensing mass maps. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare transformer-based methods to CNNs. We also examine performance scaling with the number of available $N$-body simulations, highlighting the importance of pre-training for transformer architectures. We find that the Swin transformer performs significantly better than vanilla ViTs, especially with limited training data. Despite their higher representational capacity, the Figure of Merit for cosmology achieved by transformers is comparable to that of CNNs under realistic noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Inference of $B$-mode polarization in the presence of non-Gaussian foregrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflationary $B$-mode signals encode invaluable information about the origin of our Universe and searching for potential signatures of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) is one of the major science goals for future precision observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. However, dominant $B$-mode signals of both Galactic foreground contamination and gravitational lensing effects prevent direct measurements of the PGW $B$-mode signals. There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios. This study will be important for new physics studies with $B$-mode signatures.</description>

      <title>Counting voids and filaments: Betti Curves as a Powerful Probe for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological analysis of galaxy distributions has gathered increasing attention in cosmology, as they are able to capture non-Gaussian features of large-scale structures (LSS) that are overlooked by conventional two-point clustering statistics. We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $\sigma_8$, and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$. These findings highlight Betti curves -- especially when combined with traditional two-point statistics -- as a promising, interpretable tool for future galaxy survey analyses.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy and the Unresolved Hubble Tension: Multi-model Constraints from DESI 2025 and Other Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, $\phi$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $\xi$ model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension. Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w &lt; -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w &gt; -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter. Our results demonstrate that dark energy evolves with cosmic time, challenging the cosmological constant paradigm.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Limit non-Gaussianity Estimation with Cosmic Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity using the large-scale modulation of the local lensing power spectrum. Our work extends our recently proposed $\pi$-field method for primordial non-Gaussianity estimation to spherical coordinates and applies it to galaxy lensing. Our approach is computationally efficient and only requires binned multipole power spectra $C_\ell(z_1,z_2)$ on large scales, as well as their covariance. Our method is simpler to implement than a full bispectrum estimator, but still contains the full squeezed-limit information. We validate our model using a suite of N-body simulations and demonstrate its accuracy in recovering the $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ values. We then perform a Fisher forecast for an LSST-like weak lensing survey, finding $\sigma_{f_{\mathrm{NL}}} \simeq 12$. Our approach readily combines with other $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$-sensitive fields such as kSZ velocity reconstruction and clustering-based $\pi$-fields, for a future combined $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ estimator using various large-scale galaxy and CMB observables.</description>

      <title>Phase-space perturbation theory for cosmic large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a perturbative approach to the Vlasov-Poisson system for cosmic structure formation that does not rely on any truncation of the momentum-cumulant hierarchy. The generally non-trivial linear solution is computed by solving a Volterra-type integral equation and higher orders are obtained recursively. As expected, the results of Eulerian standard perturbation theory are recovered for perfectly cold initial conditions. Deviating slightly from the latter by introducing a homogeneous and isotropic initial velocity dispersion, we show that all higher momentum cumulants are generated dynamically at any perturbative order. We support our numerical solutions by an analytical large-scale approximation. Our approach serves as a basis for exploring different background-perturbation splits of the phase-space density and non-perturbative techniques.</description>

      <title>Prospects for independent measurement of $\boldsymbol{\ell}$=1,2,3 CMB anisotropy multipoles using the anisotropic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for observing a specific spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, which occurs due to the anisotropy of the radiation when it is scattered by hot plasma of galaxy clusters. Detection of this "anisotropic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect" will allow us to independently measure the anisotropy multipoles with $\ell=1,2,3$, separate the Sachs-Wolf effect from the integrated Sachs-Wolf effect (Rees-Sciama effect) and, to a certain extent, circumvent the 'cosmic variance' problem for low multipoles. We propose a modified Least Response Method for the components separation in the data processing and estimate the required sensitivity of the experiment for such observations. We test our approach on a simulated signal that is contaminated by various foregrounds with poorly defined spectral shapes, along with distortions of the relic blackbody spectrum caused by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and its relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>ZTF-SEDm Type Ia supernova sample for Twins Embedding spectrophotometric standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>DESI Strong Lens Foundry V: A Sample of HST-Observed Strong Lenses Modeled with GIGA-Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07823v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present six galaxy-scale strong lenses with HST imaging modeled using GIGA-Lens. This is Paper V of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry series. These systems were discovered in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using ML/AI methods and confirmed with DESI, Keck/NIRES, and VLT/MUSE spectroscopy. They span $z_d = 0.39 - 1.1$ and $z_s = 1.4 - 3.3$. This is the first HST strong lens sample modeled with full forward modeling -- all lens and source parameters sampled simultaneously in a single inference -- with explicit convergence validation using both $\widehat{R}$ and effective sample size (ESS) for each system. All inferred parameters satisfy $\widehat{R} &lt; 1.1$ and ${\rm ESS} \gtrsim 10,000$, demonstrating that GIGA-Lens achieves statistically robust inference even for some of the most complex galaxy-scale lenses known. These results pave the way for scaling to much larger, high-resolution strong lens samples from HST, Euclid, JWST, and Roman. Convergence-validated modeling will be critical for key science goals, including constraining the mass-density profile of galaxies, detecting low-mass dark matter (sub)halos, and delivering precise and accurate cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>Possible $\nu$ Source Class: 3-sigma Detection of High-Energy Neutrinos from Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the sources of high-energy (TeV-PeV) astrophysical neutrinos is crucial for studies in both astrophysics and particle physics. Despite extensive searches for more than a decade, which revealed several individual potential sources and only one potential source class, the origins of these neutrinos remain largely unresolved; thus, more source classes should be investigated. In this work, we conduct the first search for high-energy neutrino emission from a new source class, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), which are also theoretically motivated. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis on our constructed catalog of 693 SMBHB candidates and 10 years of IceCube public data. Our results show positive correlations, with higher significance in more physically motivated scenarios and the highest significance at 3.0$\sigma$. In addition, we also study potential connections between SMBHBs' high-energy neutrino and nano-Hz gravitational-wave emissions, the latter being the main target of pulsar timing arrays. Our results provide the first evidence of SMBHBs being high-energy neutrino emitters.</description>

      <title>Quenching factors for Na recoils as a function of Tl dopant concentrations in NaI(Tl) crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detectors play an important role in the field of direct dark matter (DM) searches. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source. However, this effect was not observed when using a low-energy calibration line from $^{133}$Ba.</description>

      <title>From the Intergalactic to the Interstellar Scales -- EQUALS: a High-resolution Legacy Survey of Gas in the Distant Universe Using ESPRESSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the Universe evolved from diffuse primordial gas into the rich cosmic web we observe today is one of the great challenges of modern astrophysics. Quasar absorption lines - the imprints left by intervening gas on the light from distant quasars - provide key diagnostics of many aspects of this investigation, ranging from fundamental physics to cosmology and galaxy formation. The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields. In this article, we present the ESPRESSO Quasar Absorption Line Survey (EQUALS), an ESO Large Programme, designed to tackle several outstanding questions from constraining the properties of dark matter at the smallest scales probed by the Lyman-alpha forest to determining the temperature of the intergalactic medium at z ~ 4 and precisely quantifying the chemical contributions of stellar populations in the early Universe. EQUALS will provide a legacy sample of deep spectra to showcase ESPRESSO capabilities to the quasar absorption line community whilst providing epoch measurements for the key science goals of upcoming spectroscopic instrumentation on the next generations of telescopes.</description>

      <title>Apparent Phantom Crossing in Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicated the possibility that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ might change from $w&lt;-1$ to $w&gt;-1$ when the redshift $z\sim 0.5$, which is called the inverse phantom crossing. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.</description>

Abstract: We report a mm-wave search for axions from the magnetar SGR 1745-2900, based on 4.8 h of ALMA observations. No statistically significant features are detected between 133.99-135.78, 135.91-137.70, 145.99-147.78, and 147.99-149.78 GHz. Interpreting this null result via resonant conversion with a state-of-the-art star model and the dark-matter density expected at the Galactic Center, we constrain the axion-photon coupling at the level of $g_{\gamma}\gtrsim 2\times10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ within 0.55-0.62 meV, accessing for the first time the QCD axion parameter space near the meV scale.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoder Pretraining on Strong-Lensing Images for Joint Dark-Matter Model Classification and Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can reveal the influence of dark-matter substructure in galaxies, but analyzing these effects from noisy, low-resolution images poses a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in the cold vector dark matter environment</title>

Abstract: With regard to the observed dark matter density profile in galaxies and clusters, the scalar dark matter scenario has been previously studied for potential detectability through gravitational wave observations at measurable signal-to-noise ratios. In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</description>

      <title>Paucity of downward UHE neutrino tracks in IceCube versus unexpected huge KM3-230213A event: solving the puzzles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A. It appeared as the most energetic neutrino ever observed: about 200 PeV (2 10^17 eV) up to EeV (10^18 eV) energy. This huge value, is puzzling. It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy. At EeV energy such upward tau air-showers should shine AUGER telescopes or blaze future satellite in Space. A previous model in astrophysics considered energetic neutrino E&gt;&gt;100 EeV, neutrino scattering, onto cosmic, relic, light mass ones. Their ultra-relativistic Z boson resonance formation and its decay in flight would produce hadron UHECR relics around tens-hundred EeV energy. Explaining how sources located at far distances, above the usual GZK hundred Mpc, cut off ones, may shine and cluster in AUGER or TA data.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of Primordial Black Holes in a Thermal Universe: A Thermofield Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a finite temperature environment on the Hawking radiation from black holes (BHs), with particular focus on Kerr BHs immersed in a cosmological thermal bath. The emitted particles from BHs interact with the thermal background and thermalize, leading to a modification in the Hawking radiation spectrum. By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs). As a result, the lifetime of PBH shortens compared to the zero temperature vacuum and leads to interesting cosmological consequences.</description>

      <title>Revisiting PBH Accretion, Evaporation and Their Cosmological Consequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe. Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $\lambda_{\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\sim 4$--$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\sim 2.7\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors.</description>

Abstract: The distinction between weak and strong lensing is somewhat arbitrary, and both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, since they require different approaches. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be in place. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward.</description>

      <title>Probing Primordial Black Hole Formation from Domain Wall Isocurvature Perturbations: Constraints and Implications</title>

Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects produced by the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of discrete symmetry during cosmological phase transitions. Domain walls can significantly contribute to the energy density in the late-evolution stage. We propose that the density perturbations from the fluctuations in the number density of the domain walls could collapse to form primordial black holes. This mechanism becomes effective when the domain wall energy density ratio to that of the radiation reaches about 0.1 in the radiation-dominated Universe. We find that models with $Z_2$ symmetry are excluded for interpreting pulsar timing array observations on the nano-Hz gravitational wave background since this model's domain wall number density fluctuations could lead to an overabundance of the primordial black holes. Moreover, the models, which generate approximately $N\sim 10$ domain walls from the spontaneous breaking of a discrete $Z_N$ symmetry, are also subject to stringent constraints due to the overproduction of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: The study of ultralight dark matter helps to constrain the lower bound of the mass in minimally coupled dark matter models. The granular structure of ultralight dark matter density fields produces metric perturbations which have been identified as a potentially interesting probe of this model. For dark matter masses $m \gtrsim 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$, these perturbations would fluctuate on timescales comparable to observational timescales. In this paper, we estimate the expected time delay these fluctuations would generate in simulated pulsar signals. We simulate arrays of mock pulsars in a fluctuating granular density field. We calculate the expected Shapiro time delay, gravitational redshift, and Doppler shift and compare analytical estimates with the results of simulations. Finally, we provide a comparison with existing pulsar observation sensitivities.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form from gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, giving rise to rich phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology. We develop a novel, general, and systematic method based on theory of density contrast peaks to calculate the abundance of PBHs for a broad power spectrum of curvature perturbations with Gaussian statistics. We introduce a window function to account for the relevant perturbation scales associated with PBHs of different masses, along with a filter function that removes unphysical contributions from super-horizon-scale overdensities. While some uncertainties remain due to the limited understanding of the nonlinear collapse process, our approach substantially reduces the discrepancy previously observed between peaks theory and the Press-Schechter formalism.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter Archaeology with Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the complementary information to be gained from inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) signals and searches for QCD axion dark matter. We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. In scenarios where such a blue tilt is present, the enhanced GW signal allows future interferometers to place non-trivial constraints on the parameters $m_Q$ and $f_a$, thereby complementing haloscope searches. While some degeneracies with other parameters such as $m_Q$ remain, detectors such as BBO and ET will be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the small-scale web around galaxies with miniJPAS and DESI</title>

Abstract: We present the first statistical observational study detecting filaments in the immediate surroundings of galaxies, i.e. the local web of galaxies. Simulations predict that cold gas, the fuel for star formation, is channeled through filamentary structures into galaxies. Yet, direct observational evidence for this process has been limited by the challenge of mapping the cosmic web at small scales. Using miniJPAS spectro-photometric data combined with spectroscopic DESI redshifts when available, we construct a high-density observational galaxy sample spanning 0.2&lt;z&lt;0.8. Local filaments are detected within a 3 Mpc physical radius of each galaxy with stellar mass M* &gt;10^(10) Msun using all nearby galaxies as tracers, combined with a probabilistic adaptation of the DisPerSE algorithm designed to overcome limitations due to photometric redshift uncertainties. Our methodology is tested and validated using mock catalogues built with random forest models applied to a simulated lightcone. Besides recovering the expected increase in galaxy connectivity (defined as the number of filaments attached to a galaxy) with stellar mass, we show that our connectivity measurements agree with 3D reference estimates from the mock galaxies. Thanks to these filament reconstructions, we explore the relation between small-scale connectivity and galaxy star formation rate, finding a mild positive trend which needs to be confirmed by follow up studies with larger sample sizes. We propose galaxy connectivity to local filaments as a powerful and physically motivated metric of environment, offering new insights into the role of cosmic structure in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Effective Phantom Divide Crossing with Standard and Negative Quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background data from the {\it Planck} satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this {\it Letter}, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.26\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>The role of peculiar velocity uncertainties in standard siren cosmology</title>

Abstract: Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, for GW170817-like sirens located within 50 Mpc with 5% distance errors, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.</description>

Abstract: The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of modern cosmology.</description>

      <title>Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al. 2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about $2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <title>Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \sqrt{\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \kappa/\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \sim H_\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\kappa \ \simeq \ \varepsilon \ \simeq \ 1/3$ and $H_\star/H_0 \ \simeq \ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One possible way to explain the observed effective dark energy equation of state crossing $w=-1$ (the phantom divide) is through modified gravity. A key point is to not view the expansion history in isolation but to take into account the other gravitational impacts on growth of large scale structure, lensing, etc. Within shift symmetric Horndeski gravity this implies three main paths for the late time cosmic expansion. All require unusual kinetic structure and we analyze their various implications for how $w$ should behave after phantom crossing.</description>

      <title>Absorption in the 21 cm Hydrogen Line at $z&gt;10$ as a Sensitive Tool for the Construction of a Cosmological Model on Small Scales</title>

Abstract: The cosmic microwave background absorption intensity in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the presence of additional power in the form of a "bump" in the spectrum of cosmological density perturbations is calculated. The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k&gt;1$~Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Massive Black Hole Merger Host Galaxies from Cosmological Simulations II: Unique Stellar Kinematics in Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure methods for identifying the host galaxies of individual massive black hole (MBH) binaries and mergers detected by gravitational wave experiments such as LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays are currently lacking, but will be critical to a variety of science goals. Recently in Bardati et al. (2024, Paper I), we used the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to show that MBH merger host galaxies have unique morphologies in imaging, due to their stronger bulges. Here, we use the same sample of simulated MBH merger host galaxies to investigate their stellar kinematics, as probed by optical integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy. We perform stellar population synthesis and dust radiative transfer to generate synthetic 3D optical spectral datacubes of each simulated galaxy, and produce mock stellar kinematic maps. Based on a linear discriminant analysis of a combination of kinematic parameters derived from these maps, we show that this approach can identify MBH binary and merger host galaxies with accuracies that increase with chirp mass and mass ratio. For mergers with high chirp masses (&gt;10^8.2 Msun) and high mass ratios (&gt;0.5), the accuracies reach &gt;85%, and their host galaxies are uniquely characterized by slower rotation and stronger stellar kinematic misalignments. These kinematic properties are commonly associated with massive early-type galaxies that have experienced major mergers, and naturally act as signposts for MBH binaries and mergers with high chirp masses and mass ratios. These results suggest that IFU spectroscopy should also play a role in telescope follow-up of future MBH binaries and mergers detected in gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Axion forces in axion backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of an (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of their pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced in the presence of an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible experimental probes of this effect in two distinct scenarios: an axion dark matter background and a solar axion flux, using fifth-force searches and atomic spectroscopy experiments. In the axion dark matter case, we find that the background-induced axion force can place strong constraints on axion couplings and masses, comparable to existing astrophysical bounds.</description>

      <title>Insights into the highest natural scale: Finite naturalness challenges inflationary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the criterion of finite naturalness to the limiting case of a generic heavy sector decoupled from the Standard Model. The sole and unavoidable exception to this decoupling arises from gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that gravity can couple the Higgs to the heavy scale significantly earlier than the well-known three-loop top-quark-mediated diagrams discussed in previous literature. As an application, we show that finite naturalness disfavors large-field inflationary models involving super-Planckian field excursions. In contrast, in the small-field regime, achieving successful inflation requires substantial fine-tuning of the initial conditions, in agreement with previous results. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope further amplify the tension between naturalness and fine-tuning, challenging the theoretical robustness of single-field inflation as a compelling explanation for the origin of the universe.</description>

      <title>Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06454v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenology of the ``Dark Walker'' -- an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector. During inflation, its walking dynamics generate primordial non-Gaussianities through the exchange of unparticles, while accounting for the current dark matter relic abundance if we consider freeze-in of Dark Walker coupled to the Standard Model through the Higgs portal. This provides a simple yet predictive example linking strongly coupled inflationary dynamics to present-day dark matter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Cool Cores: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Cool Core Cluster Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray bright cool-core (CC) clusters contain luminous radio sources accelerating cosmic ray (CR) leptons at prodigious rates. Near the acceleration region, high-energy leptons produce synchrotron (mini)halos and sometimes observable gamma rays, but these leptons have short lifetimes and so cannot propagate far from sources without some rejuvenation. However, low-energy (~0.1-1 GeV) CRs should survive for &gt;Gyr, potentially reaching ~100 kpc before losing energy via inverse-Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons to keV X-ray energies, with remarkably thermal X-ray spectra. In groups/clusters, this will appear similar to relatively 'cool' gas in cluster cores (i.e. CCs). In lower-mass (e.g. Milky Way/M31) halos, analogous CR IC emission will appear as hot (super-virial) gas at outer CGM radii, explaining recent diffuse X-ray observations. We show that for plausible (radio/gamma-ray observed) lepton injection rates, the CR-IC emission could contribute significantly to the X-ray surface brightness (SB) in CCs, implying that CC gas densities may have been overestimated and alleviating the cooling flow problem. A significant IC contribution to diffuse X-ray emission in CC clusters also explains the tight correlation between the X-ray 'cooling luminosity' and AGN/cavity/jet power, because the apparent CC emission is itself driven by the radio source. Comparing observed Sunyaev Zeldovich to X-ray inferred pressures at $\ll 100$ kpc in CCs represents a clean test of this scenario, and existing data appears to favor significant CR-IC. A significant IC contribution also implies that X-ray inferred gas-phase metallicities have been underestimated in CCs, potentially explaining the discrepancy between X-ray (sub-Solar) and optical/UV (super-Solar) observed metallicities in the central ~10 kpc of nearby CCs. We also discuss the model's connection to observations of multiphase gas in clusters.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning the cosmological environment to scales well below the dust sublimation region. The infrared (IR) emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the active galactic nuclei (AGN) is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>Sterile neutrino dark matter from a TeV Scale Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly interacting sterile neutrino dark matter candidate within a low-scale seesaw framework. The Type-I seesaw model is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet ($\Phi_{\nu}$), which couples exclusively to the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the lepton doublet, thereby generating the neutrino Dirac mass term while the first scalar doublet is responsible for giving mass to the remaining Standard Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) acts as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced via decays of $W^\pm$, $Z$ and extra scalars present in the setup. We point out that $W^\pm$ and $Z$ contributions were overlooked in the previous studies, which actually dominate the $N_1$ production by a factor of $\sim 10^{13}$ and solely determines the relic abundance. Incorporating them leads to several novel consequences for the DM phenomenology like a new non-thermal condition which leads to smaller Yukawa couplings. We thoroughly discuss about the enhancement possibilities of $N_1$'s mass which is controlled by the small vacuum expectation value ($v_{\nu}$) of the second Higgs doublet. After incorporating the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, this setup can accommodate both warm and cold dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>jFoF: GPU Cluster Finding with Gradient Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present jFoF, a fully GPU-native Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo finder designed for both high-performance simulation analysis and differentiable modeling. Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host--device transfers. We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/bhorowitz/jFOF/.</description>

      <title>Klein Bottle Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.</description>

      <title>Popcorn EMRIs: Transient Gravitational Wave Signals and Their Analysis in Schwartz Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with orbital periods exceeding the observational timescale of mHz gravitational wave observatories. In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals ``popcorn EMRIs.'' We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P&gt;1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis.</description>
