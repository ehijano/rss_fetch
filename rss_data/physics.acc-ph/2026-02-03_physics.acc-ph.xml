      <title>KEK Accelerator Test Facility Low-Level RF and Timing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KEK Accelerator Test Facility (ATF) is a dedicated testbed for nanobeam technologies in support of the International Linear Collider (ILC). Stable pulsed operation requires synchronization of the facility timing system with the Low-Level RF (LLRF) system. The timing system distributes trigger and gate signals to key subsystems, including the DAQ, klystrons, laser systems, pulsed kicker magnets, and interlocks. The LLRF system provides phase-coherent RF references and facility-wide clock distribution for synchronization. Achieving ~100 fs-level synchronization depends critically on the phase-noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) of the distributed clock signals and on preserving this performance throughout the distribution network. We present facility-wide measurements of the KEK ATF LLRF clock PN-PSD and discuss the resulting synchronization floor imposed by the stability of the ATF Linac and Damping Ring signal generators.</description>

      <title>First Experimental Demonstration of Beam Storage by Three-Dimensional Spiral Injection Scheme for Ultra-Compact Storage Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional spiral injection scheme enables storage in ultra-compact rings with nanosecond revolution period. We report the first successful storage of a $297\,\mathrm{keV/}c$ electron beam in a $22\,\mathrm{cm}$ weak-focusing storage ring with a $4.7\,\mathrm{ns}$ revolution period using multi-turn vertical kick with a $140\,\mathrm{ns}$ kicker pulse. Using a scintillating-fiber detector, we observe a signal exceeding $5\sigma$ of the pre-injection rms noise for $\geq 1\,\mathrm{\mu s}$, confirming beam storage. By varying the weak-focusing field configuration and measuring the stored beam distribution, we show that the storage beam resides within the predicted region by Monte Carlo simulations. This result is a key proof-of-principle for realizing ultra-compact storage rings for next-generation precision measurements including the muon experiments at J-PARC and PSI.</description>

      <title>Heat load measurements for the PIP-II pHB650 cryomodule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-3 testing of the pHB650 cryomodule at the PIP-II Injector Test Facility was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of heat load mitigations performed after earlier phases of testing and to continue pinpointing any sources of unexpectedly high heat loads.. The programme measured HTTS, LTTS, and 2 K isothermal/non-isothermal loads under "standard", "linac", and "simulated dynamic" operating modes, recording data both inside the cryomodule and across the bayonet can circuits. Thermal-acoustic oscillations were eliminated by replacing the original G10 cooldown-valve stem with a stainless-steel stem fitted with wipers. A newly developed Python script automated acquisition of ACNET data, performed real-time heat-load calculations, and generated plots and tables that were posted to the electronic logbook within minutes, vastly reducing manual effort and accelerating feedback between SRF and cryogenics teams. Analysis showed that JT heat-exchanger effectiveness and temperature stratification in the two-phase and relief piping strongly influence the observed loads and helped isolate sources of excess heat. The campaign demonstrates that rigorous pre-test planning, real-time diagnostics, and automated reporting can improve both accuracy and efficiency, providing a template for future PIP-II cryomodule tests and for implementing targeted heat-load mitigations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current Model for Finite Element Simulations of Rutherford Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Distributed Inter-Strand Coupling Current (DISCC) model. It is a finite element (FE) model based on a homogenization approach enabling efficient and accurate simulation of the transient magnetic response of superconducting Rutherford cables without explicitly representing individual strands. The DISCC model reproduces the inter-strand coupling current dynamics via a novel mixed FE formulation, and can be combined with the Reduced Order Hysteretic Magnetization (ROHM) and Flux (ROHF) models in order to reproduce the effects of internal strand dynamics: hysteresis, eddy, and inter-filament coupling currents, as well as ohmic effects. The DISCC model offers a massive reduction of the computational time compared to fully detailed FE models and still accounts for all types of loss and magnetization contributions. As a result, Rutherford cables homogenized with the DISCC model can be directly included in FE models of magnet cross-sections for efficient electro-magneto-thermal simulations of their transient response. We present two possible FE formulations for the implementation of the DISCC model, a first one based on the h-phi-formulation, and a second one based on the h-phi-a-formulation, which is well suited for an efficient treatment of the ferromagnetic regions in magnet cross-sections.</description>
