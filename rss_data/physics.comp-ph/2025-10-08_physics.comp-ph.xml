      <title>SHarmonic: A fast and accurate implementation of spherical harmonics for electronic-structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors present SHarmonic, a new implementation of the spherical harmonics targeted for electronic-structure calculations. Their approach is to use explicit formulas for the harmonics written in terms of normalized Cartesian coordinates. This approach results in a code that is as precise as other implementations while being at least one order of magnitude more computationally efficient. The library can run on graphics processing units (GPUs) as well, achieving an additional order of magnitude in execution speed. This new implementation is simple to use and is provided under an open source license, it can be readily used by other codes to avoid the error-prone and cumbersome implementation of the spherical harmonics.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) QCD processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments providing further optimizations of CUDACPP for GPUs, which I consider ready for inclusion in a new release of the software. The new approach mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which has been so far performed using a single large GPU kernel, into several smaller kernels. I also take this opportunity to describe more in detail some features of the CUDACPP software that are relevant to these new developments and that have not yet been documented.</description>

      <title>msmJAX: Fast and Differentiable Electrostatics on the GPU in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present msmJAX, a Python package implementing the multilevel summation method with B-spline interpolation, a linear-scaling algorithm for efficiently evaluating electrostatic and other long-range interactions in particle-based simulations. Built on the JAX framework, msmJAX integrates naturally with the machine-learning methods that are transforming chemistry and materials science, while also serving as a powerful tool in its own right. It combines high performance with Python's accessibility, offers easy deployment on GPUs, and supports automatic differentiation. We outline the modular design of msmJAX, enabling users to adapt or extend the code, and present benchmarks and examples, including a verification of linear scaling, and demonstrations of its stability in molecular-dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds - Stabilized finite element formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a stabilized finite element formulation of the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) surface theory for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving manifolds developed in Sauer (2025). The formulation is physically frame-invariant, applicable to large deformations, and relevant to fluidic surfaces such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid membranes, which are complex and inherently unstable physical systems. It is applied here to area-incompressible surface flows using a stabilized pressure-velocity (or surface tension-velocity) formulation based on quadratic finite elements and implicit time integration. The unknown ALE mesh motion is determined by membrane elasticity such that the in-plane mesh motion is stabilized without affecting the physical behavior of the system. The resulting three-field system is monolithically coupled, and fully linearized within the Newton-Rhapson solution method. The new formulation is demonstrated on several challenging examples including shear flow on self-evolving surfaces and inflating soap bubbles with partial inflow on evolving boundaries. Optimal convergence rates are obtained in all cases. Particularly advantageous are C1-continuous surface discretizations, for example based on NURBS.</description>

      <title>Functional Connectivity Networks for Transportation Delay Analysis: from Theory to Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the endeavour of modelling and understanding the propagation of delays in transportation networks, an approach that has attracted increasing interest in the last decade is the creation of functional network representations. These graphs map elements of interest (e.g. airports or stations) as nodes, and derive pairwise propagation patterns from their dynamics through correlation and causality tests. In spite of multiple notable results, this approach still lacks a coherent framework, with decisions related to many fundamental steps being left to the judgement of the researcher. We here provide an introduction to the theory behind functional networks for transportation systems, detailing the main steps and the associated pitfalls. We further introduce a Python package, delaynet, designed to support the researcher in the reconstruction and analysis of such networks. We finally present an analysis of the propagation of delays in the Swiss train system; and discuss future research steps.</description>

      <title>TeMFpy: a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states into tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TeMFpy, a Python library for converting fermionic mean-field states to finite or infinite matrix product state (MPS) form. TeMFpy includes new, efficient, and easy-to-understand algorithms for both Slater determinants and Pfaffian states. Together with Gutzwiller projection, these also allow the user to build variational wave functions for various strongly correlated electron systems, such as quantum spin liquids. We present all implemented algorithms in detail and describe how they can be accessed through TeMFpy, including full example workflows. TeMFpy is built on top of TeNPy and, therefore, integrates seamlessly with existing MPS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tunable electronic energy level alignment and exciton diversity in organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: van der Waals stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a powerful platform for engineering material interfaces with tailored electronic and optical properties. While most van der Waals multilayers have featured inorganic monolayers, incorporating molecular monolayers introduces new degrees of tunability and functionality. Here, we investigate hybrid bilayers composed of atomically thin perylene-based molecular crystals interfaced with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically MoS2 and WS2. Using ab initio many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach, we predict emergent properties beyond those of the isolated constituent systems. Notably, we find substantial renormalization of monolayer molecular crystal band gap due to TMD-induced polarization. Furthermore, by varying the TMD monolayer, we demonstrate tuning of the energy level alignment of the bilayer and subsequent control over a diversity of lowest-energy excitons, which include strongly bound hybrid excitons and long-lived charge-transfer excitons. These findings establish organic-inorganic van der Waals heterostructures as a promising class of materials for tunable optoelectronic devices and quantum excitonic phenomena, expanding the design space for low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials Enable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Doped MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first computational framework for molecular dynamics simulation of MoS2 doped with 25 elements spanning metals, non-metals, and transition metals using Meta's Universal Model for Atoms machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP). Benchmarking against density functional theory calculations demonstrates the accuracy of the MLIP for simulating doped-MoS2 systems and highlights opportunities for improvement. Using the MLIP, we perform heating-cooling simulations of doped-MoS2 supercells. The simulations capture complex phenomena including dopant clustering, MoS2 layer fracturing, interlayer diffusion, and chemical compound formation at orders-of-magnitude reduced computational cost compared to density functional theory. This work provides an open-source computational workflow for application-oriented design of doped-MoS2, enabling high-throughput screening of dopant candidates and optimization of compositions for targeted tribological, electronic, and optoelectronic performance. The MLIP bridges the accuracy-efficiency gap between first-principles methods and empirical potentials, and the framework offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale materials discovery in two-dimensional doped material systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier Features and Attention-Driven Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer (S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder, and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.</description>

      <title>Bilevel optimization for learning hyperparameters: Application to solving PDEs and inverse problems with Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for solving scientific computing and inference problems, such as kernel- and neural network-based approaches for partial differential equations (PDEs), inverse problems, and supervised learning tasks, depend crucially on the choice of hyperparameters. Specifically, the efficacy of such methods, and in particular their accuracy, stability, and generalization properties, strongly depends on the choice of hyperparameters. While bilevel optimization offers a principled framework for hyperparameter tuning, its nested optimization structure can be computationally demanding, especially in PDE-constrained contexts. In this paper, we propose an efficient strategy for hyperparameter optimization within the bilevel framework by employing a Gauss-Newton linearization of the inner optimization step. Our approach provides closed-form updates, eliminating the need for repeated costly PDE solves. As a result, each iteration of the outer loop reduces to a single linearized PDE solve, followed by explicit gradient-based hyperparameter updates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through Gaussian process models applied to nonlinear PDEs and to PDE inverse problems. Extensive numerical experiments highlight substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to conventional random hyperparameter initialization. In particular, experiments with additive kernels and neural network-parameterized deep kernels demonstrate the method's scalability and effectiveness for high-dimensional hyperparameter optimization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Muon-induced Backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation of muon-induced backgrounds for the Colorado Underground Research Institute (CURIE), a shallow-underground facility with $\approx 415$~m.w.e. overburden. Using coupled \textsc{mute} and \textsc{geant4} frameworks, we characterize the production and transport of muon-induced secondaries through site-specific rock compositions and geometries, establishing a proof-of-concept for high-precision, end-to-end simulations. Our simulations employ angular-dependent muon energy distributions, which improve secondary flux accuracy. For the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I research spaces, we predict total muon-induced neutron fluxes of $(3.78 \pm 0.61_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(3.97 \pm 0.65_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-3}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, respectively, consistent with empirical depth parameterizations. The simulated neutron energy spectra exhibit the expected thermal, epithermal, evaporation, and spallation components extending to GeV energies. Electromagnetic backgrounds are expected to dominate the total flux, with $\gamma$-ray components of $(5.54 \pm 0.91_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $(6.51 \pm 1.06_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{-1}$~m$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the Subatomic Particle Hideout and Cryolab I facilities, respectively. These results provide quantitative background predictions for experimental design and sensitivity projections at shallow- and deep-underground facilities. They further demonstrate that local geology and overburden geometry influence muon-induced secondary yields and energy spectra, emphasizing the need for site-specific simulations for accurate underground background characterization. Therefore, the simulation framework has been made publicly available for the broader low-background physics community to enable meaningful inter-facility comparisons.</description>

      <title>The dawn of alchemical free-energy methods in biomolecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the onset of fundamental statistical mechanical constructs formulated in the late 19th century, alchemical free-energy methods slowly emerged and transitioned to become operational tools of biomolecular simulation applicable to a wide range of problems including protein-ligand binding for drug discovery research. This article reconstructs how statistical mechanical approaches such as thermodynamic integration and free-energy perturbation were reconfigured in the early 1980's to address the complexities of increasingly heterogeneous biomolecular systems. Drawing on oral history interviews and primary literature, the study examines the technical, institutional, theoretical, and infrastructural conditions under which these methods were implemented, and became progressively operational. These conditions encompassed the consolidation of lab-specific software infrastructures, the formulation of practical simulation protocols, as well as essential statistical mechanical clarifications. From this perspective, the progress of free-energy methods proceeded less from a unified convergence than from an iterative troubleshooting process of alignment involving practical and theoretical considerations. The aim of the present article is to offer a historically grounded account of how free-energy techniques acquired practical and functional reliability.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FreeBird, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Efficiency of Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Calculations of Dynamic Response Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) constitutes an essential technique for diagnosing material properties under extreme conditions, such as high pressures and intense laser heating. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is one of the most accurate available ab initio methods for modeling XRTS spectra, as well as a host of other dynamic material properties. However, strong thermal excitations, along with the need to account for variations in temperature and density as well as the finite size of the detector significantly increase the computational cost of TDDFT simulations compared to ambient conditions. In this work, we present a broadly applicable method for optimizing and enhancing the efficiency of TDDFT calculations. Our approach is based on a one-to-one mapping between the dynamic structure factor and the imaginary time density--density correlation function, which naturally emerges in Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum many-body theory. Specifically, we combine rigorous convergence tests in the imaginary time domain with a constraints-based noise attenuation technique to improve the efficiency of TDDFT modeling without the introduction of any significant bias. As a result, we can report a speed-up by up to an order of magnitude, thus potentially saving millions of CPU hours for modeling a single XRTS measurement of matter under extreme conditions.</description>
