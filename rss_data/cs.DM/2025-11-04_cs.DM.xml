      <title>An Approximation Algorithm for Monotone Submodular Cost Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the minimum submodular cost allocation (MSCA) problem. The input of MSCA is $k$ non-negative submodular functions $f_1,\ldots,f_k$ on the ground set $N$ given by evaluation oracles, and the goal is to partition $N$ into $k$ (possibly empty) sets $X_1,\ldots,X_k$ so that $\sum_{i=1}^k f_i(X_i)$ is minimized. In this paper, we focus on the case when $f_1,\ldots,f_k$ are monotone (denoted by Mono-MSCA). We provide a natural LP-relaxation for Mono-MSCA, which is equivalent to the convex program relaxation introduced by Chekuri and Ene. We show that the integrality gap of the LP-relaxation is at most $k/2$, which yields a $k/2$-approximation algorithm for Mono-MSCA. We also show that the integrality gap of the LP-relaxation is at least $k/2-\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ when $k$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>A Couple of Simple Algorithms for $k$-Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbf{R}^d$, and a positive integer $k \leq n$, the $k$-dispersion problem is that of selecting $k$ of the given points so that the minimum inter-point distance among them is maximized (under Euclidean distances). Among others, we show the following:
  (I) Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in the plane, and a positive integer $k \geq 2$, the $k$-dispersion problem can be solved by an algorithm running in $O\left(n^{k-1} \log{n}\right)$ time. This extends an earlier result for $k=3$, due to Horiyama, Nakano, Saitoh, Suetsugu, Suzuki, Uehara, Uno, and Wasa (2021) to arbitrary $k$. In particular, it improves on previous running times for small $k$.
  (II) Given a set $P$ of $n$ points in $\mathbf{R}^3$, and a positive integer $k \geq 2$, the $k$-dispersion problem can be solved by an algorithm running in $O\left(n^{k-1} \log{n}\right)$ time, if $k$ is even; and $O\left(n^{k-1} \log^2{n}\right)$ time, if $k$ is odd. For $k \geq 4$, no combinatorial algorithm running in $o(n^k)$ time was known for this problem.
  (III) Let $P$ be a set of $n$ random points uniformly distributed in $[0,1]^2$. Then under suitable conditions, a $0.99$-approximation for $k$-dispersion can be computed in $O(n)$ time with high probability.</description>

      <title>Free polynomial strong bimonoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, in weighted automata theory the weight structure of strong bimonoids has found much interest; they form a generalization of semirings and are closely related to near-semirings studied in algebra. Here, we define polynomials over a set $X$ of indeterminates as well as an addition and a multiplication. We show that with these operations, they form a right-distributive strong bimonoid, that this polynomial strong bimonoid is free over $X$ in the class of all right-distributive strong bimonoids and that it is both left- and right-cancellative. We show by purely algebraic reasoning that two arbitrary terms are equivalent modulo the laws of right-distributive strong bimonoids if and only if their representing polynomials are equivalent by the laws of only associativity and commutativity of addition and associativity of multiplication. We give effective procedures for constructing the representing polynomials. As a consequence, we obtain that the equivalence of arbitrary terms modulo the laws of right-distributive strong bimonoids can be decided in exponential time. Using term-rewriting methods, we show that each term can be reduced to a unique polynomial as normal form. We also derive corresponding results for the free idempotent right-distributive polynomial strong bimonoid over $X$. We construct an idempotent strong bimonoid which is weakly locally finite but not locally finite and show an application of it in weighted automata theory.</description>

      <title>A parallel pull labelling algorithm for the resource constrained shortest path problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Resource Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP) is a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem in which the goal is to find a least-cost path in a directed graph subject to one or more resource constraints. In this paper we present a pull labelling algorithm for the RCSPP that introduces i) a highly parallelisable approach at a label bucket level, ii) an extension to bi-directional search with a dynamic midpoint, and iii) a vectorised dominance criterion that uses vector instructions to speed-up the label comparison with another level of parallelisation. Compared to a baseline version of the algorithm the optimisations result in a speed-up of around 14x on a set of hard instances and up to 200x on some of the hardest instances. The proposed algorithm demonstrates significant computational improvements that may enhance the efficiency of column generation frameworks incorporating resource constrained shortest path sub-problems, potentially enabling the efficient solution of larger-scale instances in routing, scheduling, supply chain and transportation network optimisation applications.</description>

      <title>Reliability evaluation of Cayley graph generated by unicyclic graphs based on cyclic fault pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph connectivity serves as a fundamental metric for evaluating the reliability and fault tolerance of interconnection networks. To more precisely characterize network robustness, the concept of cyclic connectivity has been introduced, requiring that there are at least two components containing cycles after removing the vertex set. This property ensures the preservation of essential cyclic communication structures under faulty conditions. Cayley graphs exhibit several ideal properties for interconnection networks, which permits identical routing protocols at all vertices, facilitates recursive constructions, and ensures operational robustness. In this paper, we investigate the cyclic connectivity of Cayley graphs generated by unicyclic triangle free graphs. Given an symmetric group $Sym(n)$ on $\left\{ 1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ and a set $\mathcal{T}$ of transpositions of $Sym(n)$. Let $G(\mathcal{T})$ be the graph on vertex set $\left\{ 1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ and edge set $\left\{ij\colon(ij)\in \mathcal{T}\right\}$. If $G(\mathcal{T})$ is a unicyclic triangle free graphs, then denoted the Cayley graph Cay$(Sym(n),\mathcal{T})$ by $UG_{n}$. As a result, we determine the exact value of cyclic connectivity of $UG_{n}$ as $\kappa_{c}(UG_{n})=4n-8$ for $n\ge 4 $.</description>

      <title>On acyclic b-chromatic number of cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph. An acyclic $k$-coloring of $G$ is a map $c:V(G)\rightarrow \{1,\dots,k\}$ such that $c(u)\neq c(v)$ for any $uv\in E(G)$ and the subgraph induced by the vertices of any two colors $i,j\in \{1,\dots,k\}$ is a forest. If every vertex $v$ of a color class $V_i$ misses a color $\ell_v\in\{1,\dots,k\}$ in its closed neighborhood, then every $v\in V_i$ can be recolored with $\ell_v$ and we obtain a $(k-1)$-coloring of $G$. If a new coloring $c'$ is also acyclic, then such a recoloring is an acyclic recoloring step and $c'$ is in relation $\triangleleft_a$ with $c$. The acyclic b-chromatic number $A_b(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum number of colors in an acyclic coloring where no acyclic recoloring step is possible. Equivalently, it is the maximum number of colors in a minimum element of the transitive closure of $\triangleleft_a$. In this paper, we consider $A_b(G)$ of cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion: When Is the Diameter Bound Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07065v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parameterized and kernelization complexity of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion problem, a distance-bounded generalization of Cluster Edge Deletion. Given a graph G = (V, E) and integers k and s, the goal is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component in the resulting graph has diameter at most s. This captures a broad class of distance-constrained graph modification problems that lie between clustering and connectivity control.
  We prove that for s = 2 the problem is NP-hard already on split graphs, closing the gap between the polynomially solvable cases s = 1 and s = 3. For this setting we give a cubic vertex kernel parameterized by k, the first polynomial kernel for 2-Club Cluster Edge Deletion on split graphs. On the structural side, we show that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by pathwidth (and hence treewidth), implying that the diameter bound s is crucial for fixed-parameter tractability. In contrast, the problem is FPT when parameterized by treedepth, neighborhood diversity, or the cluster vertex deletion number.
  Finally, we design an FPT bicriteria approximation scheme that, for graphs excluding long induced cycles, runs in time f(k, 1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} and outputs a solution of size at most k whose components have diameter at most (1 + epsilon) * s. We further present an exact FPT algorithm for interval graphs parameterized by k and a polynomial-time algorithm for unit interval graphs. We also introduce the directed variant s-Club Cluster Arc Deletion and show it is W[1]-hard when parameterized by k, even on DAGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all connected induced subgraphs of a graph $G=(V,E)$. As a variation we enumerate all "packings of connected sets", i.e. partitions $\Pi$ of $V$ with the property that each part of $\Pi$ induces a connected subgraph. More generally, for various types $T$ of graphs we do (one or both of) the following: (i) enumerate all type $T$ (induced) subgraphs of a given graph $G$, or (ii) enumerate all packings of type $T$ subgraphs of $G$</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. We conventionally set $k = 1$ when $G$ is $2$-edge-connected. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $k &lt; N-n$. A \textit{configuration} of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A \textit{move} is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The {\it pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$} is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. Let $\D(G)$ denote the diameter of the graph $G$, and let $\CL(G)$ denote the maximum length of a shortest cycle containing a vertex $v$, taken over all vertices $v$ in all $2$-connected components of $G$. For completeness, we define $\CL(G) := 1$ when $G$ is a tree. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problem on a pair $(G, P)$ is in $\Ord\left(n\D(G) + \min\left\{k n \D(G),\ n^{2} \log\big(1+\min\{n, k\}\big)\right\}\right)$ if $G$ is an $N$-vertex tree, and in $\Ord\left(n\D(G)+\frac{n^2\min\{n,\CL(G)\}}{N-n}+n^2\log(1+\min\{n, N-n\})\right)$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. Furthermore, in the case where $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph and the number of unoccupied spaces $N - n$ is bounded by some constant, this length admits an upper bound of $\Ord(n \CL(G) \D(G))$.

Abstract: We present a construction of non-rectifiable, repetitive Delone sets in every Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. We further obtain a close to optimal repetitivity function for such sets. The proof is based on the process of encoding a non-realisable density in a Delone set, due to Burago and Kleiner.</description>

      <title>Translating between the representations of an acyclic convex geometry of bounded degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of translating between irreducible closed sets and implicational bases in closure systems. To date, the complexity status of this problem is widely open, and it is further known to generalize the notorious hypergraph dualization problem, even in the context of acyclic convex geometries, i.e., closure systems admitting an acyclic implicational base. This paper studies this later class with a focus on the degree, which corresponds to the maximal number of implications in which an element occurs. We show that the problem is tractable for bounded values of this parameter, even when relaxed to the notions of premise- and conclusion-degree. Our algorithms rely on structural properties of acyclic convex geometries and involve various techniques from algorithmic enumeration such as solution graph traversal, saturation techniques, and a sequential approach leveraging from acyclicity. They are shown to perform in incremental-polynomial time. Finally, we complete these results by showing that our running times cannot be improved to polynomial delay using the standard framework of flashlight search.</description>
