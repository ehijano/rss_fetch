      <title>Formation of nonlinear modes in one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattices with a mobility edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of steady states in one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates of repulsively interacting ultracold atoms loaded into a quasiperiodic potential created by two incommensurate periodic lattices. We study the transformations between linear and nonlinear modes and describe the general patterns that govern the birth of nonlinear modes emerging in spectral gaps near band edges. We show that nonlinear modes in a symmetric potential undergo both symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcations and saddle-node bifurcations, mimicking the prototypical behaviors of symmetric and asymmetric double-well potentials. The properties of the nonlinear modes differ for bifurcations occurring below and above the mobility edge. In the generic case, when the quasiperiodic potential consists of two incommensurate lattices with a nonzero phase shift between them, the formation of localized modes in the spectral gaps occurs through a cascade of saddle-node bifurcations. Because of the analogy between the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, our results can also be applied to optical modes guided by quasiperiodic photonic lattices.</description>

      <title>Breather bound states in a parametrically driven magnetic wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of systematic investigation of localized dynamical states in the model of a one-dimensional magnetic wire, which is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. The dissipative term in the LLG equation is compensated by the parametric drive imposed by the external AC magnetic field, which is uniformly applied perpendicular to the rectilinear wire. The existence and stability of the localized states is studied in the plane of the relevant control parameters, viz., the amplitude of the driving term and the detuning of its frequency from the parametric resonance. With the help of systematically performed simulations of the LLG equation, existence and stability areas are identified in the parameter plane for several species of the localized states: stationary single- and two-soliton modes, single and double breathers, drifting double breathers with spontaneously broken inner symmetry, and multi-soliton complexes. Multistability occurs in this system. The breathers emit radiation waves (which explains their drift caused by the spontaneous symmetry breaking, as it breaks the balance between the recoil from the waves emitted to left and right), while the multi-soliton complexes exhibit cycles of periodic transitions between three-, five-, and seven-soliton configurations. Dynamical characteristics of the localized states are systematically calculated too. These include, in particular, the average velocity of the asymmetric drifting modes, and the largest Lyapunov exponent, whose negative and positive values imply that the intrinsic dynamics of the respective modes is regular or chaotic, respectively.</description>

      <title>Ground-state phase transitions in spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate phase transitions of the ground state (GS) of spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates under the combined action of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and gradient magnetic field. Introducing appropariate raising and lowering operators, we exactly solve the linear system. Analyzing the obtained energy spectrum, we conclude that simultaneous variation of the magnetic-field gradient and SOC strength leads to the transition of excited states into the GS. As a result, any excited state can transition to the GS, at appropriate values of the system's parameters. The nonlinear system is solved numerically, showing that the GS phase transition, similar to the one in the linear system, still exists under the action of the repulsive nonlinearity. In the case of weak attraction, a mixed state appears near the GS transition point, while the GS transitions into an edge state under the action of strong attractive interaction.</description>

      <title>Engineering spectro-temporal light states with physics-trained deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-trained convolutional neural network (P-CNN) can circumvent such challenges, showing few-fold speedups over the direct approaches. We highlight three key advancements enabled by the P-CNN approach: (i) on-demand control over spectral features of SC, (ii) direct generation of sub-3-cycle pulses from the highly nonlinear fiber, and (iii) the production of high-order solitons, capturing distinct "breather" dynamics in both spectral and temporal domains. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal state engineering, with transformative implications for ultrafast and quantum science.</description>
