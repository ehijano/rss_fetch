      <title>An Improved Multi-Agent Algorithm for Cooperative and Competitive Environments by Identifying and Encouraging Cooperation among Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an improved algorithm by identifying and encouraging cooperative behavior in multi-agent environments. First, we analyze the shortcomings of existing algorithms in addressing multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. Then, based on the existing algorithm MADDPG, we introduce a new parameter to increase the reward that an agent can obtain when cooperative behavior among agents is identified. Finally, we compare our improved algorithm with MADDPG in environments from PettingZoo. The results show that the new algorithm helps agents achieve both higher team rewards and individual rewards.</description>

      <title>MAHL: Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Hierarchical Chiplet Design with Adaptive Debugging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity, the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles, innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis, placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However, LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.</description>

      <title>Macroeconomic Foundation of Monetary Accounting by Diagrams of Categorical Universals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a category theoretical formulation of the Monetary Macroeconomic Accounting Theory (MoMaT) of Men\'endez and Winschel [2025]. We take macroeconomic (national) accounting systems to be composed from microeconomic double-entry systems with real and monetary units of accounts. Category theory is the compositional grammar and module system of mathematics which we use to lift micro accounting consistency to the macro level. The main function of money in MoMaT is for the repayment of loans and not for the exchange of goods, bridging the desynchronisation of input and output payments of producers. Accordingly, temporal accounting consistency is at the macroeconomic level. We show that the accounting for macroeconomies organised by a division of labor can be consistent and stable as a prerequisite for risk and GDP sharing of societies. We exemplify the theory by five sectoral agents of Labor and Resource owners, a Company as the productive sector, a Capitalist for profits, and a Bank as the financial sector providing loans to synchronise the micro and the macro levels of an economy. The dynamics is described by eight sectoral macroeconomic bookings in each period demonstrating stable convergence of the MoMaT in numerical simulations. The categorical program implements a consistent evolution of hierarchical loan repayment contracts by an endofunctor. The universal constructions of a limit verify all constraints as the sectoral investment and learning function at the macroeconomic level. The dual colimit computes the aggregated informations at the macro level as usual in the mathematics of transitions from local to global structures. We use visual diagrams to make complex economic relationships intuitive. This paper is meant to map economic to categorical concepts to enable interdisciplinary collaboration for digital twins of monetary accounting systems.</description>

      <title>MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works, such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge. Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Against Poaching: Latent Composite Flow Matching for Wildlife Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spore in the Wild: A Case Study of Spore.fun as an Open-Environment Evolution Experiment with Sovereign AI Agents on TEE-Secured Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has usually been pursued within isolated, closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an open-environment system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN), which provides permissionless computational substrates, enables the deployment of Large Language Model-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether open-environment ALife systems "in the wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.</description>

      <title>Congestion Mitigation Path Planning for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Navigation in Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-density environments where numerous autonomous agents move simultaneously in a distributed manner, streamlining global flows to mitigate local congestion is crucial to maintain overall navigation efficiency. This paper introduces a novel path-planning problem, congestion mitigation path planning (CMPP), which embeds congestion directly into the cost function, defined by the usage of incoming edges along agents' paths. CMPP assigns a flow-based multiplicative penalty to each vertex of a sparse graph, which grows steeply where frequently-traversed paths intersect, capturing the intuition that congestion intensifies where many agents enter the same area from different directions. Minimizing the total cost yields a set of coarse-level, time-independent routes that autonomous agents can follow while applying their own local collision avoidance. We formulate the problem and develop two solvers: (i) an exact mixed-integer nonlinear programming solver for small instances, and (ii) a scalable two-layer search algorithm, A-CMTS, which quickly finds suboptimal solutions for large-scale instances and iteratively refines them toward the optimum. Empirical studies show that augmenting state-of-the-art collision-avoidance planners with CMPP significantly reduces local congestion and enhances system throughput in both discrete- and continuous-space scenarios. These results indicate that CMPP improves the performance of multi-agent systems in real-world applications such as logistics and autonomous-vehicle operations.</description>

      <title>Nash Convergence of Mean-Based Learning Algorithms in First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03906v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence properties of learning dynamics in repeated auctions is a timely and important question, with numerous applications in, e.g., online advertising markets. This work focuses on repeated first-price auctions where bidders with fixed values learn to bid using mean-based algorithms -- a large class of online learning algorithms that include popular no-regret algorithms such as Multiplicative Weights Update and Follow the Perturbed Leader. We completely characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, under two notions of convergence: (1) time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium converges to 1; (2) last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of bidders converges to a Nash equilibrium. Specifically, the results depend on the number of bidders with the highest value:
  - If the number is at least three, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in both time-average and last-iterate.
  - If the number is two, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in time-average but not necessarily last-iterate.
  - If the number is one, the dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average or last-iterate.
  Our discovery opens up new possibilities in the study of the convergence of learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>On the $h$-majority dynamics with many opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first upper bound on the convergence time to consensus of the well-known $h$-majority dynamics with $k$ opinions, in the synchronous setting, for $h$ and $k$ that are both non-constant values. We suppose that, at the beginning of the process, there is some initial additive bias towards some plurality opinion, that is, there is an opinion that is supported by $x$ nodes while any other opinion is supported by strictly fewer nodes. We prove that, with high probability, if the bias is $\omega(\sqrt{x})$ and the initial plurality opinion is supported by at least $x = \omega(\log n)$ nodes, then the process converges to plurality consensus in $O(\log n)$ rounds whenever $h = \omega(n \log n / x)$. A main corollary is the following: if $k = o(n / \log n)$ and the process starts from an almost-balanced configuration with an initial bias of magnitude $\omega(\sqrt{n/k})$ towards the initial plurality opinion, then any function $h = \omega(k \log n)$ suffices to guarantee convergence to consensus in $O(\log n)$ rounds, with high probability. Our upper bound shows that the lower bound of $\Omega(k / h^2)$ rounds to reach consensus given by Becchetti et al.\ (2017) cannot be pushed further than $\widetilde{\Omega}(k / h)$. Moreover, the bias we require is asymptotically smaller than the $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ bias that guarantees plurality consensus in the $3$-majority dynamics: in our case, the required bias is at most any (arbitrarily small) function in $\omega(\sqrt{x})$ for any value of $k \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required for safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, simulation is used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how group pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are quantitatively meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.</description>

      <title>MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field.</description>
