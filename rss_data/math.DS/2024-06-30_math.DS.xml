      <title>Strict Lyapunov functions and energy decay in Hamiltonian chains with degenerate damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Hamiltonian chain of rotators (in general nonlinear) in which the first rotator is damped. Being motivated by problems of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of crystals, we construct a strict Lyapunov function that allows us to find a lower bound for the total energy dissipation rate when the energy and time are large. Our construction is explicit and its analysis is rather straightforward. We rely on a method going back to Matrosov, Malisoff and Mazenc, which we review in our paper. The method is rather universal and we show that it is applicable to a chain of oscillators as well.</description>

      <title>Separation of horocycle orbits on moduli space in genus 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative closing lemma for the horocycle flow induced by the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-action on the moduli space of Abelian differentials with a double-order zero on surfaces of genus 2. The proof proceeds via construction of a Margulis function measuring the discretized fractal dimension of separation of a horocycle orbit of a point from itself, in a direction transverse to the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-orbit. From this, we deduce that small transversal separation guarantees the existence of a nearby point with a pseudo-Anosov in its Veech group. This is reminiscent of the initial dimension phases in Bourgain-Gamburd for random walks on compact groups, Bourgain-Lindenstrauss-Furman-Mozes for quantitative equidistribution in tori, and quantitative equidistribution of horocycle flow for a product of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ with itself due to Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi-Wang, and multiple other works.</description>

      <title>On an Interaction Model of General Language Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the following article, we construct an interaction model (a variant of the SIR-model) of general language change. In the context of language change it is desirable to deduce the long-term behaviour of the corresponding dynamical system (for example to decide if complete of reversible language change are going to happen). We analyse this dynamical system by first proving non-existence of periodic orbits and then invoking the Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson theorem to show convergence to critical points only. Non-existence of periodic orbits is established by contradiction in showing that the average position of a potential periodic orbit must coincide with a certain critical point $C$ which cannot be encircled by the flow of the dynamical system so that the average position would be pulled to that side. Thus the long-term behaviour of the model for any given initial constellation of speakers depends only on four interaction parameters and can be easily analysed by looking at the four critical points. Subsequent numerical analysis of real data on language change is used to justify the relevance of the constructed model for the practicing quantitative linguist. We show how data-fitting methods can be used to determine the four interaction parameters and predict from them the long-term behaviour of the system, i.e. if complete language change or reversible language change will take place.</description>

      <title>Ergodic optimization for continuous functions on the Dyck-Motzkin shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodic optimization aims to describe dynamically invariant probability measures that maximize the integral of a given function. The Dyck and Motzkin shifts are well-known examples of transitive subshifts over a finite alphabet that are not intrinsically ergodic. We show that the space of continuous functions on any Dyck-Motzkin shift splits into two subsets: one is a dense $G_\delta$ set with empty interior for which any maximizing measure has zero entropy; the other is contained in the closure of the set of functions having uncountably many, fully supported measures that are Bernoulli. One key ingredient of a proof of this result is the path connectedness of the space of ergodic measures of the Dyck-Motzkin shift.</description>

      <title>Quasi-compactness of Frobenius-Perron Operator for Piecewise Convex Maps with Countable Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the quasi-compactness of the Frobenius-Perron operator for a piecewise convex map $\tau$ with a countably infinite number of branches on the interval $I=[0,1]$. We establish that for high enough $n$ iterates of $\tau$, $\tau^n$ are piecewise expanding. Using the Lasota-Yorke Inequality derived from references \cite{hofbauer1982} and \cite{keller1985}, adapted to meet the assumptions of the Ionescu-Tulcea and Marinescu ergodic theorem, we demonstrate the existence of absolutely continuous invariant measure (ACIM) $\mu$ for $\tau$, the exactness of the dynamical system $(I, \tau,\mu)$ and the quasi-compactness of Frobenius-Perron operator $P_\tau$ induced by $\tau$. The last fact implies a multitude of strong ergodic properties of $\tau$.</description>

      <title>Direct low-energy trajectories to Near-Earth Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are asteroids, comets and meteoroids in heliocentric orbits with perihelion below 1.3 au. Similarly to the population of the Main Asteroid Belt, NEOs are primordial bodies and their study can improve our understanding of the origins of the Solar System. With a catalog of over 30~000 known asteroids and approximately 100 listed short-period comets, the NEO population represents an inventory of exploration targets reachable with significantly lower cost than the objects of the Main Asteroid Belt. In addition, the materials present in these bodies could be used to resupply spacecraft en route to other destinations. The trajectories of past missions to NEOs have been designed with the patched-conics technique supplemented by impulsive and/or low-thrust maneuvers and planetary gravity assist. The transfer times range from some months to a few years, and the close-approach speeds relative to the target have been as high as 10 km/s. The design technique described in this work leverages the invariant structures of the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) to connect the vicinity of the Earth with NEOs in low-eccentricity, low-inclination orbits. The fundamental building blocks are periodic orbits around the collinear points L$_1$ and L$_2$ of the Sun-Earth CR3BP. These orbits are used to generate paths that follow the associated hyperbolic invariant manifolds, exit the sphere of influence of the Earth and reach NEOs on nearby orbits. The strategy is simple, can be applied to depart either a libration point orbit or the vicinity of the Earth, and offers attractive performance features.</description>

      <title>An insightful approach to bearings-only tracking in log-polar coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of coordinate system in a bearings-only (BO) tracking problem influences the methods used to observe and predict the state of a moving target. Modified Polar Coordinates (MPC) and Log-Polar Coordinates (LPC) have some advantages over Cartesian coordinates. In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions for the target state prior distribution after ownship manoeuvre: the mean, covariance, and higher-order moments in LPC. We explore the use of these closed-form expressions in simulation by modifying an existing BO tracker that uses the UKF. Rather than propagating sigma points, we directly substitute current values of the mean and covariance into the time update equations at the ownship turn. This modified UKF, the CFE-UKF, performs similarly to the pure UKF, verifying the closed-form expressions. The closed-form third and fourth central moments indicate non-Gaussianity of the target state when the ownship turns. By monitoring these metrics and appropriately initialising relative range error, we can achieve a desired output mean estimated range error (MRE). The availability of these higher-order moments facilitates other extensions of the tracker not possible with a standard UKF.</description>

      <title>Graded differential groups, Cartan-Eilenberg systems and conjectures in Conley index theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cartan-Eilenberg systems play an prominent role in the homological algebra of filtered and graded differential groups and (co)chain complexes in particular. We define the concept of Cartan-Eilenberg systems of abelian groups over a poset. Our main result states that a filtered chain isomorphism between free, P-graded differential groups is equivalent to an isomorphism between associated Cartan-Eilenberg systems. An application of this result to the theory of dynamical systems addresses two open conjectures posed by J. Robbin and D. Salamon regarding uniqueness type questions for connection matrices. The main result of this paper also proves that three connection matrix theories in the literature are equivalent in the setting of vector spaces, as well as uniqueness of connection matrices for Morse-Smale gradient systems.</description>

      <title>Diagonal flow detects topology of strata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.12197v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay between the diagonal flow on, and the topology of, a stratum component of a space of rooted quadratic differentials. We prove that the flow group -- the subgroup of the fundamental group generated by almost-flow loops -- equals the fundamental group. As a corollary, we show that the plus and minus modular Rauzy-Veech groups are finite-index subgroups of their ambient modular monodromy groups. This partially answers a question of Yoccoz. Using this, and recent advances on algebraic hulls and Zariski closures of symplectic monodromy groups, we prove that the Rauzy-Veech groups are Zariski dense in their ambient symplectic groups. Density, in turn, implies the simplicity of the plus and minus Lyapunov spectra of any component of any stratum of quadratic differentials. We thus establish the Kontsevich -- Zorich conjecture.</description>

      <title>Wild attractors for Fibonacci maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existence of wild attractors -- attractors whose basin has a positive Lebesgue measure but is not a residual set -- has been one of central themes in one-dimensional dynamics. It has been demonstrated by H. Bruin et al. that Fibonacci maps with a sufficiently flat critical point admit a wild attractor. We propose a constructive trichotomy that describes possible scenarios for the Lebesgue measure of the Fibonacci attractor based on a computable criterion. We use this criterion, together with a computer-assisted proof of existence of a Fibonacci renormalization $2$-cycle for non-integer critical degrees, to demonstrate that Fibonacci maps do not have a wild attractor when the degree of the critical point is $d=3.8$ (and, conjecturally, for $2&lt; d \le 3.8$), and do admit it when $d=5.1$ (and, conjecturally, for $d \ge 5.1$).</description>

      <title>Locally moving groups and laminar actions on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove various results that, given a sufficiently rich subgroup $G$ of the group of homeomorphisms on the real line, describe the structure of the other possible actions of $G$ on the line, and address under which conditions such actions must be semi-conjugate to the natural defining action of $G$. The main assumption is that $G$ should be locally moving, meaning that for every open interval the subgroup of elements fixing pointwise its complement, acts on it without fixed points. We show that when $G$ is a locally moving group, every $C^1$ action of $G$ on the real line is semi-conjugate to its standard action or to a non-faithful action. The situation is much wilder when considering actions by homeomorphisms: for a large class of groups, we describe uncountably many conjugacy classes of faithful minimal actions. Next, we prove structure theorems for $C^0$ actions, based on the study of laminar actions, which are actions on the line preserving a lamination. When $G$ is a group of homeomorphisms of the line acting minimally, and with a non-trivial compactly supported element, then any faithful minimal action of $G$ on the line is either laminar or conjugate to its standard action. Moreover, when $G$ is a locally moving group with a suitable finite generation condition, for any faithful minimal laminar action there is a map from the lamination to the line, called a horograding, which is equivariant with respect to the action on the lamination and the standard one, and with some extra suitable conditions. This establishes a tight relation between all minimal actions on the line of such groups, and their standard actions. Finally, based on an analysis of the space of harmonic actions, we show that for a large class of locally moving groups, the standard action is locally rigid, in the sense that sufficiently small perturbations in the compact-open topology give semi-conjugate actions.</description>
