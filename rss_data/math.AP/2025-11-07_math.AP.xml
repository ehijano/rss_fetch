      <title>On blow-ups of sets with finite fractional variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and a set $E \subset \mathbb R^N$ with locally finite fractional $\alpha$-variation, we show that for almost every $x \in \mathbb R^N$ with respect to the $\alpha$-variation measure of $\mathbf 1_E$, if $E$ admits a non-trivial tangent set at $x$ with locally finite integer perimeter, then $E$ also admits a tangent half-space oriented by the fractional unit normal of $E$ at $x$.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of Stokes waves with piecewise smooth vorticity in deep water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of Stokes waves with piecewise smooth vorticity in a two-dimensional, infinitely deep fluid domain. These waves represent traveling water waves propagating over sheared currents in a semi-infinite cylinder, where the vorticity may exhibit discontinuities. The analysis is carried out by applying a hodograph transformation, which reformulates the original free boundary problem into an abstract elliptic boundary value problem. Compared to previously studied steady water waves, the present setting introduces several novel features: the presence of an internal interface, an unbounded spatial domain, and a non-Fredholm linearized operator. To address these difficulties, we introduce a height function formulation, casting the problem as a transmission problem with suitable transmission conditions. A singular bifurcation approach is then employed, combining global bifurcation theory with Whyburns topological lemma. Along the global bifurcation branch, we show that the resulting wave profiles either attain arbitrarily large wave speed or approach horizontal stagnation.</description>

      <title>The Kato problem and extensions for degenerate elliptic operators of higher order in weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Kato problem and extensions for degenerate elliptic operators of arbitrary order $2m$ ($m\geq 1$), whose coefficients are measurable, complex-valued and satisfy the G$\mathring{a}$rding inequality with respect to a Muckenhoupt $A_{2}$-weight; this generalizes the work of [Cruz-Uribe, Martell and Rios 2018]. As an application, the unweighted $L^{p}$-Dirichlet, regularity and Neumann boundary value problems associated to such an operator are solved when $p$ is sufficiently close to $2.$</description>

      <title>A variational Lippmann-Schwinger-type approach for the Helmholtz impedance problem on bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, reduced order modeling methods have been applied to solving inverse boundary value problems arising in frequency domain scattering theory. A key step in projection-based reduced order model methods is the use of a sesquilinear form associated with the forward boundary value problem. However, in contrast to scattering problems posed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, boundary value formulations lose certain structural properties, most notably the classical Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation is no longer available. In this paper we derive a Lippmann-Schwinger type equation aimed at studying the solution of a Helmholtz boundary value problem with a variable refractive index and impedance boundary conditions. In particular, we start from the variational formulation of the boundary value problem and we obtain an equivalent operator equation which can be viewed as a bounded domain analogue of the classical Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We first establish analytical properties of our variational Lippmann-Schwinger type operator. Based on these results, we then show that the parameter-to-state map, which maps a refractive index to the corresponding wavefield, maps weakly convergent sequences to strongly convergent ones when restricted to refractive indices in Lebesgue spaces with exponent greater than 2. Finally, we use the derived weak to strong sequential continuity to show existence of minimizers for a reduced order model based optimization methods aimed at solving the inverse boundary value problem as well as for a conventional data misfit based waveform inversion method.</description>

      <title>Fujita exponent for heat equation with H\"{o}rmander vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show global existence and non-existence results for the heat equation with some of the squares of smooth vector fields on $\Rn$ satisfying H\"{o}rmander's rank condition with a non-linearity of the form $f(u)$, where $f$ is a suitable function and $u$ is the solution. In particular, when $f(u)=u^p$, we calculate the critical Fujita exponent. We also give necessary conditions for blow-up or, alternatively, a sufficient condition for the existence of positive global solutions for time-dependent nonlinearities of the type $\varphi(t)f(u)$.</description>

      <title>NLS with mass-subcritical combined nonlinearities: small mass $L^2$-scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove small data scattering in the mass-subcritical regime for the NLS equation with double nonlinearities, where a focusing leading term is perturbed by a lower order defocusing nonlinear term. Our proof relies on the pseudo-conformal transformation in conjunction with a general variational argument used to obtain the positivity of certain modified energies. Moreover, the smallness assumption is only on the mass of the initial data, and not on the whole $\Sigma$-norm.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering dynamics in the Vlasov-Poisson equation near an attractive point mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of radially symmetric solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson equation consisting of an attractive point mass and a small, suitably localized and absolutely continuous distribution of particles: if the latter is initially localized on hyperbolic trajectories for the associated Kepler problem, we obtain global in time, unique Lagrangian solutions that asymptotically undergo a modified scattering dynamics (in the sense of distributions). A key feature of this result is its low regularity regime, which does not make use of derivative control, but can be upgraded to strong solutions and strong convergence by propagation of regularity.</description>

      <title>2D Navier-Stokes with Navier Slip: Strong Vorticity Convergence and Strong Solutions for Unbounded Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a smooth, bounded domain with Navier boundary conditions. Starting from an initial vorticity in $L^p$ with $p&gt;2$, we show strong convergence of the vorticity in the vanishing viscosity limit. We utilize a purely interior framework from Seis, Wiedemann, and Wo\'{z}nicki, originally derived for no-slip, and upgrade local to global convergence. Under the same assumptions, we also show that the velocity is in fact a strong solution and satisfies the Navier slip conditions for any positive time. The key idea is to study the Laplacian subject to Navier boundary conditions and prove that this boundary-value problem is elliptic in the sense of Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg.</description>

      <title>Regularizing effect of the interplay between coefficients in linear and semilinear $X$-elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the regularizing effect arising from the interaction between the coefficient \(a\) of the zero order term and the datum \(f\) in the problem $$ \left\lbrace \begin{array}{ll}
  -\mathcal{L}u + a(x) g(u) = f(x) \quad &amp;\mbox{in} \;\; \Omega,
  u = 0 \quad &amp;\mbox{on} \;\; \partial\Omega, \end{array} \right. $$ where $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded domain and $\mathcal{L}$ is an $X$-elliptic operator introduced by Lanconelli and Kogoj. If $f \in L^1(\Omega)$, we prove that the \(Q\)-condition introduced by Arcoya and Boccardo is sufficient to ensure the existence and boundedness of solutions in the framework of $X$-elliptic operators as well. Finally, we prove the existence of a bounded solution for linear problems under a more general condition between $f$ and $a$.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow-up for a multi-dimensional model of the Kiselev-Sarsam equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study a multi-dimensional nonlocal active scalar equation of the form \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+g\mathcal{R}_a\rho\cdot \nabla\rho= 0,~\rho(\cdot,0)=\rho_{0}, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $\mathcal{R}_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} \mathcal{R}_af(x)=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{n+1}{2})}{\pi^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}P.V.\int\limits_{\mathbb{R}^n}\Big(\frac{x-y}{|x-y|^{n+1}}-\frac{x-y}{(|x-y|^2+a^2)^{\frac{n+1}{2}}}\Big)f(y)dy. \end{eqnarray*} This model can be viewed as a natural generalization of the well-known Kiselev-Sasarm equation, which was introduced in [14] as a one-dimensional model for the two-dimensional incompressible porous media equation. We show the local well-posedness for this multi-dimensional model as well as the gradient blow-up in finite time for a class of initial data.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates and $\eta-$compactness for anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau minimizers with tangential anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minimizers $u_\varepsilon$ of the Ginzburg-Landau energy with quadratic divergence or curl penalization on a simply-connected two-dimensional domain $\Omega$. On the boundary, strong tangential anchoring is imposed. We prove a priori estimates for $u_\varepsilon$ in $L^\infty$ uniform in $\varepsilon$ and that the Lipschitz constant of $u_\varepsilon$ blows up like $\varepsilon^{-1}$. We then deduce compactness for a subsequence that converges to an $\mathbb{S}^1-$valued map with either one interior point defect or two boundary half-defects. We conclude our study with a proof that no boundary vortices can occur in the divergence penalized case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G\'erard and Grellier proposed, under the name of the cubic Szeg\H{o} equation, a remarkable classical field theory on a circle with a quartic Hamiltonian. The Lax integrability structure that emerges from their definition is so constraining that it allows for writing down an explicit general solution for prescribed initial data, and at the same time, the dynamics is highly nontrivial and involves turbulent energy transfer to arbitrarily short wavelengths. The quantum version of the same Hamiltonian is even more striking: not only the Hamiltonian itself, but also its associated conserved hierarchies display purely integer spectra, indicating a structure beyond ordinary quantum integrability. Here, we initiate a systematic study of this quantum system by presenting a mixture of analytic results and empirical observations on the structure of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, conservation laws, ladder operators, etc.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Ott-Antonsen Manifold is an Unstable Manifold in the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interacting particle systems of Kuramoto-type. Our focus is on the dynamical relation between the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the continuum limit (CL) and the one obtained in the mean-field limit (MFL). Both equations arise when we are considering the limit of infinitely many interacting particles but the classes of PDEs are structurally different. The CL tracks particles effectively pointwise, while the MFL is an evolution for a typical particle. First, we briefly discuss the relation between solutions of the CL and the MFL showing how to generate solutions of the CL starting from solutions of the MFL. Our main result concerns a dynamical relation between important invariant manifolds of the CFL and the MFL. In particular, we give an explicit proof that the unstable manifold of the homogeneous steady state of the CL is the direct dynamical analogue of the famous Ott-Antonsen manifold for the MFL.</description>

      <title>The Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise in critical $H^{1/2}$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Navier-Stokes equations with transport noise in critical function spaces. Assuming the initial data belongs to $H^{1/2}$ almost surely, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a local-in-time probabilistically strong solution. Moreover, we show that the probability of global existence can be made arbitrarily close to $1$ by choosing the initial data norm sufficiently small, and that the solution norm remains small for all time. Our analysis is independent of the compactness of the spatial domain, and consequently, the results apply both to the three-dimensional torus and to the whole space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in the present paper the Navier-Stokes equations on quantum Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^d_{\theta}$ with $\theta$ being a $d\times d$ antisymmetric matrix, which is a standard example of non-compact noncommutative manifolds. The quantum analogues of Ladyzhenskaya and Kato's results are established, that is, we obtain the global well-posedness in the 2D case and the local well-posedness with solution in $L_d(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in higher dimensions. To achieve these optimal results, we develop the related theory of harmonic analysis and function spaces on $\mathbb{R}^d_{\theta}$, and apply the sharp estimates around noncommutative $L_p$-spaces to quantum Navier-Stokes equations. Moreover, our techniques, which are independent of the deformed parameter $\theta$, allow us to conclude some results on the semiclassical limits. This is the first instance of systematical applications to the theory of quantum partial differential equations of the powerful real analysis techniques around noncommutative $L_p$-spaces, which date back to the seminal work \cite{PiXu97} in 1997 on noncommutative martingale inequalities. As in classical case, one may expect numerous similar applications in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study infinite dimensional holomorphic vector fields on sequence spaces, having a fixed point at $0$. Under suitable hypotheses we prove the existence of analytic invariant submanifolds passing through the fixed point. The restricted dynamics is analytically conjugate to the linear one under some Diophantine-like condition.</description>

      <title>Scalar curvature rigidity for products of spheres and tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Llarull-type rigidity for $S^{n-m}\times\mathbb{T}^m$ ($3\le n\le 7$, $1\le m\le n-2$). If a closed spin $(M^n,g)$ admits a degree-nonzero map to $S^{n-m}\times\mathbb{T}^m$ whose spherical projection is area non-increasing, and there exists $\psi\in C^\infty(M)$ with $-\Delta_M\psi-\frac{1}{2}|D_M\psi|^2+\frac{1}{2}\big(R_M-(n-m)(n-m-1)\big)\ge0$, then $(M,g)$ is isometrically covered by $S^{n-m}\times\mathbb{R}^m$. For bands, we extend Gromov's torical inequality and obtain sharp width bounds: $\text{dist}(\partial_-M,\partial_+M)\le 2\pi\sqrt{n/((n+1)\sigma)}$ when $R_M\ge (n-m)(n-m-1)+\sigma$. The method combines stable weighted slicing with a spectral Dirac operator argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Fefferman's classical square function estimate for the parabola to a weighted setting. Our weighted square function estimate is derived from a weighted wave envelope estimate for the parabola. The bounds are formulated in terms of families of multiscale tubes together with weight parameters that quantify the distribution of the weight. As an application, we obtain some weighted L^p-estimates for a class of Fourier multiplier operators and for solutions to free Schrodinger equation.</description>

      <title>Trend to equilibrium and diffusion limit for the inertial Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inertial Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation for interacting oscillatory systems. On the one hand, we prove the convergence toward corresponding phase-homogeneous stationary states in weighted Lebesgue norm sense when the coupling strength is small enough. In [10], it is proved that when the noise intensity is sufficiently large, equilibrium of the inertial Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation is asymptotically stable. For generic initial data, every solutions converges to equilibrium in weighted Sobolev norm sense. We improve this previous result by showing the convergence for a larger class of functions and by providing a simpler proof. On the other hand, we investigate the diffusion limit when all oscillators are identical. In [19], authors studied the same problem using an energy estimate on renormalized solutions and a compactness method, through which error estimates could not be discussed. Here we provide error estimates for the diffusion limit with respect to the mass m $\ll$ 1 using a simple proof by imposing slightly more regularity on the solution.</description>

Abstract: We study the minimization of anisotropic total variation functionals with additional measure terms among functions of bounded variation subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition. More specifically, we identify and characterize certain isoperimetric conditions, which prove to be sharp assumptions on the signed measure data in connection with semicontinuity, existence, and relaxation results. Furthermore, we present a variety of examples which elucidate our assumptions and results.</description>

      <title>Spreading properties of the Fisher--KPP equation when the intrinsic growth rate is maximal in a moving patch of bounded size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with spreading properties of space-time heterogeneous Fisher--KPP equations in one space dimension. We focus on the case of everywhere favorable environment with three different zones, a left half-line with slow or intermediate growth, a central patch with fast growth and a right half-line with slow or intermediate growth. The central patch moves at various speeds. The behavior of the front changes drastically depending on the speed of the central patch. Among other things, intriguing phenomena such as nonlocal pulling and locking may occur, which would make the behavior of the front further complicated. The problem we discuss here is closely related to questions in biomathematical modelling. By considering several special cases, we illustrate the remarkable diversity of possible behaviors. In particular, when the central patch has constant size and constant speed, we provide a complete set of explicit formulas for the spreading speed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the 3D fractional Schr\"odinger equation with quadratic interaction of $u\bar u$ type. We prove the global existence of solutions and scattering properties for small initial data. For the proof, one novelty is that we combine the normal form methods and the space-time resonance methods. Using the normal form transform enables us more flexibilities in designing the resolution spaces so that we can control various interactions. It is also convenient for the final data problem.</description>

      <title>Global Well-posedness and Long-time Behavior of the Two-dimensional General Ericksen--Leslie System in the Isotropic Case under a Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the global well-posedness and long-time dynamics of the general Ericksen--Leslie system for isotropic nematic liquid crystals under a constant magnetic field. On the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, a liquid crystal molecule coincides with itself under rotations by integer multiples of $\pi$, which results in special boundary conditions. We prove the existence of global-in-time strong solutions by developing novel high-order energy estimates and employing compactness techniques. A key challenge lies in controlling the orientation of the liquid crystal molecules. After achieving a uniform bound for the molecular orientation angle in $\mathbb{S}^1$, we further characterize the long-time behavior of the solutions. This is accomplished by applying the Lojasiewicz--Simon inequality, which reveals the convergence of the solutions as time approaches infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the mathematical relationship between nonlocal interactions of convolution type and multiple diffusive substances in high dimensions. Motivated by that the nonlocal evolution equations reproduce similar patterns to those in reaction-diffusion systems, we approximate nonlocal interactions in evolution equations by the solution to a reaction-diffusion system in any dimensional Euclidean space. The key aspect of this approach is that any absolutely integrable radial kernels can be approximated by a linear combination of specific Green functions. This enables us to demonstrate that any nonlocal interactions of convolution type can be approximated by a linear sum of auxiliary diffusive substances. Moreover, we show that the parameters in the reaction-diffusion system can be specified depending on the kernel shape up to three dimensions. Our results establish a connection between a broad class of nonlocal interactions and diffusive chemical reactions in dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We obtain optimal space-time estimates in $L^q_{t,x}$ spaces for all $q\ge 2$ for solutions to the Schr\"odinger equation on Zoll manifolds, including, in particular, the standard round sphere $S^d$. The proof relies on the arithmetic properties of the spectrum of the Laplacian on Zoll manifolds, as well as bilinear oscillatory integral estimates, which allow us to relate the problem to Strichartz estimate on one-dimensional tori.</description>

      <title>Gevrey regularity solution for initial data in Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces via single norm defined by nonlinearity of frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations, including well-posedness and Gevrey regularity, are a class of highly interesting problems. We are inspired by the location result on Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz space of Hobus and Saal in 2019. In order to overcome the difficulties they encountered when dealing with global well-posedness, we introduce the single norm iterative space ${^{m'}_{m} \dot{F}}^{\frac{n}{p}-1,q}_{p,r}$ and utilize tools such as the Fefferman-Stein inequality to investigate the properties of our iterative spaces. As a result, we establish the global well-posedness of Navier-Stokes equations in critical Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz space and obtain the Gevrey regularity of the mild solution. Regarding that there're many regularity studies focused on Besov spaces, such as Bae-Biswas-Tadmor(2012) and Liu-Zhang (2024), our Triebel-Lizorkin-Lorentz spaces contain more general initial value spaces, including part of Besov spaces and all of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces, etc.. Furthermore, compared with Germain-Pavlovi\'c-Staffilani (2007), our Gevrey estimation also implies spatial analyticity and is more convenient to unify the estimates of gradient of any order.</description>

Abstract: Within the FTBDNK family of formulations of relativistic Navier-Stokes (H. Freist\"uhler and B. Temple, Proc. R. Soc. A 470, 20140055 (2014), Proc. R. Soc. A 473 (2017), 20160729; F. S.

High Energy Phys. 2019, 034 (2019)), this paper collects some consistency properties for certain causal hyperbolic five-field theories obtained from the Landau-Lifshitz formulation via Eulerian gradient shifts, a family, EGS(L), of models that slightly generalize a class identified in H. Freist\"uhler, J. Math.\ Phys. 61, 033101 (2020). With $\epsilon$ the magnitude of the dissipation coefficients that quantify viscosity and heat conduction, the paper shows that any element of EGS(L) is $O(\epsilon^2)$ equivalent to the Landau-Lifshitz formulation, has an $O(\epsilon^3)$ excess entropy production, represents heterogeneous local thermodynamic equilibria cleanly, and admits regular heteroclinic profiles for all shock waves of sufficiently small amplitude.</description>

      <title>Note on the Rate of Vortex Stretching for Axisymmetric Euler Flows Without Swirl</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Childress's conjecture proposed in [Phys.D 237(14-17):1921-1925, 2008] on the growth rate of the vorticity maximum for axisymmetric swirl-free Euler flows in three and higher dimensions. We consider the setting that the axial vorticity is non-positive in the upper half space and odd in the last coordinate, which corresponds to the flow setup for head-on collision of anti-parallel vortex rings. By introducing the \emph{generalized vertical moment} and proving its monotonicity, we obtain a lower bound for the growth of the vorticity maximum, contingent on the initial decay rate in the $z$-direction. Specifically, for three-dimensional flows with initial vorticity sufficiently fast decay in $z$, we obtain a lower bound of $t^{\frac{1}{2}-}$, thereby improving upon existing results.</description>

      <title>The global well-posedness for the Q-tensor model of nematic liquid crystals in the half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Q-tensor model of nematic liquid crystals, which couples the Navier-Stokes equations with a parabolic-type equation describing the evolution of the directions of the anisotropic molecules, in the half-space. The aim of this paper is to prove the global well-posedness for the Q-tensor model in the $L_p$-$L_q$ framework. Our proof is based on the Banach fixed point argument. To control the higher-order terms of the solutions, we prove the weighted estimates of the solutions for the linearized problem by the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity. On the other hand, the estimates for the lower-order terms are obtained by the analytic semigroup theory. Here, the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity and the generation of an analytic semigroup are provided by the R-solvability for the resolvent problem arising from the Q-tensor model. It seems to be the first result to discuss the unique existence of a global-in-time solution for the Q-tensor model in the half-space.</description>

      <title>Long Time Behavior and Stabilization for Displacement Monotone Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the long time behavior of Nash equilibria in Mean Field Games within the framework of displacement monotonicity. We first show that any two equilibria defined on the time horizon $[0,T]$ must be close as $T \to \infty$, in a suitable sense, independently of initial/terminal conditions. The way this stability property is made quantitative involves the $L^2$ distance between solutions of the associated Pontryagin system of FBSDEs that characterizes the equilibria. Therefore, this implies in particular the stability in the 2-Wasserstein distance for the two flows of probability measures describing the agent population density and the $L^2$ distance between the co-states of agents, that are related to the optimal feedback controls. We then prove that the value function of a typical agent converges as $T \to \infty$, and we describe this limit via an infinite horizon MFG system, involving an ergodic constant. All of our convergence results hold true in a unified way for deterministic and idiosyncratic noise driven Mean Field Games, in the case of strongly displacement monotone non-separable Hamiltonians. All these are quantitative at exponential rates.</description>

Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we establish equivalent conditions for the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78 (2025), no. 9, 1523--1608].</description>
