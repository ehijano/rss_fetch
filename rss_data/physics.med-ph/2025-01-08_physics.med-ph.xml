      <title>3D Single-shot CEST imaging at 3T Based on True FISP Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectrally selective 3D chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging typically demands single-shot readouts for the sake of time-saving, so as to simultaneously fit multiple CEST effects. However, up to now, only fast low angle shot (FLASH) and echo planar imaging (EPI) have been predominantly utilized for this purpose. In this work, we developed a 3D single-shot CEST sequence using true fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP) readout and optimized the scanning parameters through simulations. The performance of the CEST sequence was validated using an egg white phantom, ten healthy volunteers, and a patient with a brain tumor on a 3T human scanner. Subsequently, the proposed CEST sequence utilizing True FISP was compared to the commonly used FLASH-based CEST sequence. This comparison focused on SNR and image contrast, maintaining identical pre-saturation modes, TR, TE and scanning times. In the simulation experiments, the maximum CEST signal obtained from the True FISP was significantly greater than that obtained from the FLASH sequence. In the egg white phantom, the SNRs of amide proton transfer (APT) and nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effect images obtained from the True FISP were 68.3% and 57.0% higher than those obtained from the FLASH sequence, respectively. In healthy volunteers, saturated images collected with the True FISP sequence at 3.5 ppm showed an approximate 84% increase in mean temporal SNR compared to those collected with the FLASH sequence. Compared to the FLASH sequence, the CEST images obtained from the True FISP sequence could display more detailed brain tissue structures of both normal individuals and the patient with a brain tumor. Therefore, due to the high SNR inherent in the sequence, True FISP has the potential to be used for fast and high-quality 3D image readout of CEST contrasts in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent F-Numbers Suppress Grating Lobes and Improve the Lateral Resolution in Line-by-Line Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line-by-line scanning with linear arrays is a standard image formation method in clinical ultrasound. This method examines progressively a given region of interest by conducting focused pulse-echo measurements with dynamic transmit and receive apertures. Such apertures widen with the focal length as a function of a given F-number and improve the image quality by extending the depth of field (DOF) and suppressing grating lobes. Fixed F-numbers, however, limit the lateral resolution. Herein, frequency dependence of the F-number is incorporated into both the transmit and the receive focusing to widen the apertures for low frequencies and improve the lateral resolution. Frequency-dependent transmit and receive F-numbers are proposed. These F-numbers, which can be expressed in closed form, maximize the lateral resolution under constraints on the DOF and the grating lobes. A phantom experiment showed that the proposed F-numbers eliminate grating lobe artifacts and improve both image uniformity and contrast to a similar extent as fixed F-numbers. These metrics, compared to the usage of the full apertures, improved by up to 14.1 % and 8.3 %, respectively. The proposed F-numbers, however, improved the lateral resolution by up to 24 % compared to the fixed F-numbers.</description>

      <title>Rapid, High-resolution and Distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$ Mapping of Fetal Brain using Multi-echo Radial FLASH and Model-based Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a rapid, high-resolution and distortion-free quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping technique for fetal brain at 3 T.
  Methods: A 2D multi-echo radial FLASH sequence with blip gradients is adapted for fetal brain data acquisition during maternal free breathing at 3 T. A calibrationless model-based reconstruction with sparsity constraints is developed to jointly estimate water, fat, $R_{2}^{*}$ and $B_{0}$ field maps directly from the acquired k-space data. Validations have been performed on numerical and NIST phantoms and five fetal subjects ranging from 27 weeks to 36 weeks gestation age.
  Results: Both numerical and experimental phantom studies confirm good accuracy and precision of the proposed method. In fetal studies, both the parallel imaging compressed sensing (PICS) technique with a Graph Cut algorithm and the model-based approach proved effective for parameter quantification, with the latter providing enhanced image details. Compared to commonly used multi-echo EPI approaches, the proposed radial technique shows improved spatial resolution (1.1 $\times$ 1.1 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$ vs. 2-3 $\times$ 2-3 $\times$ 3 mm$^{3}$) and reduced distortion. Quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ results confirm good agreement between the two acquisition strategies. Additionally, high-resolution, distortion-free $R_{2}^{*}$-weighted images can be synthesized, offering complementary information to HASTE.
  Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of radial acquisition for motion-robust quantitative $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping of the fetal brain. This proposed multi-echo radial FLASH, combined with calibrationless model-based reconstruction, achieves accurate, distortion-free fetal brain $R_{2}^{*}$ mapping at a nominal resolution of $1.1 \times 1.1 \times 3$ mm$^{3}$ within 2 seconds.</description>
