      <title>Model-free spectral reconstruction via Lagrange duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various physical quantities -- including real-time response, inclusive cross-sections, and decay rates -- may not be directly determined from Euclidean correlators. They are, however, easily determined from the spectral density, motivating the task of estimating a spectral density from a Euclidean correlator. This spectral reconstruction problem can be written as an ill-posed inverse Laplace transform; incorporating positivity constraints allows one to obtain finite-sized bounds on the region of spectral density functions consistent with the Euclidean data. Expressing the reconstruction problem as a convex optimization problem and exploiting Lagrange duality, bounds on arbitrary integrals of the spectral density can be efficiently obtained from Euclidean data. This paper applies this approach to reconstructing a smeared spectral density and determining smeared real-time evolution. Bounds of this form are information-theoretically complete, in the sense that for any point within the bounds one may find an associated spectral density consistent with both the available Euclidean data and positivity.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan this parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints, e.g. from Bayesian studies adjusted to agree with pQCD. All this allows us to infer and hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Lanczos, the transfer matrix, and the signal-to-noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than standard energy estimators, which are related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in standard energy estimators.</description>

      <title>Fermion Mass Generation without Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of fermion mass in a context where interactions break a discrete chiral symmetry. Then, fermion mass is not protected by a symmetry, no symmetry is broken by the generation of mass, and a vanishing mass no longer enhances a symmetry. We elaborate these scenarios for template fermionic and Yukawa theories in three dimensions where mass can be generated either by fluctuations, strong dynamics, or the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field. We find that fluctuation-induced contributions to fermion mass are parametrically suppressed in the number of fermion flavours $N$. The generation of fermion mass then takes the form of a rapid crossover which turns into a second order quantum phase transition for large $N$, much like in settings with fundamental chiral symmetry. We further discuss theories where fermion mass can be generated spontaneously without breaking any symmetry other than scale symmetry. Implications of our findings are discussed.</description>
