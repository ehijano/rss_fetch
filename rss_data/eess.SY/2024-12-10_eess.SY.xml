      <title>Error Feedback Approach for Quantization Noise Reduction of Distributed Graph Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an error feedback approach for reducing quantization noise of distributed graph filters. It comes from error spectrum shaping techniques from state-space digital filters, and therefore establishes connections between quantized filtering processes over different domains. Quantization noise expression incorporating error feedback for finite impulse response (FIR) and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) graph filters are both derived with regard to time-invariant and time-varying graph topologies. Theoretical analysis is provided, and closed-form error weight coefficients are found. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in noise reduction for the graph filters regardless of the deterministic and random graph topologies.</description>

      <title>Constant di/dz Scanning Tunneling Microscopy: Atomic Precision Imaging and Hydrogen Depassivation Lithography on a Si(100) - 2 x 1 : H Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel control mode for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) that leverages di/dz feedback. By superimposing a high-frequency sinusoidal modulation on the control signal, we extract the amplitude of the resulting tunneling current to obtain a di/dz measurement as the tip is scanned over the surface. A feedback control loop is then closed to maintain a constant di/dz, enhancing the sensitivity of the tip to subtle surface variations throughout a scan. This approach offers distinct advantages over conventional constant-current imaging. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique through high-resolution imaging and lithographic experiments on several Si(100)-2x1:H surfaces. Our findings, validated across multiple STM systems and imaging conditions, pave the way for a new paradigm in STM control, imaging, and lithography.</description>

      <title>Constrained Control for Autonomous Spacecraft Rendezvous: Learning-Based Time Shift Governor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a Time Shift Governor (TSG)-based control scheme to enforce constraints during rendezvous and docking (RD) missions in the setting of the Two-Body problem. As an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system, the TSG generates a time-shifted Chief spacecraft trajectory as a target reference for the Deputy spacecraft. This modification of the commanded reference trajectory ensures that constraints are enforced while the time shift is reduced to zero to effect the rendezvous. Our approach to TSG implementation integrates an LSTM neural network which approximates the time shift parameter as a function of a sequence of past Deputy and Chief spacecraft states. This LSTM neural network is trained offline from simulation data. We report simulation results for RD missions in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and on the Molniya orbit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The proposed scheme reduces the time to compute the time shift parameter in most of the scenarios and successfully completes rendezvous missions.</description>

      <title>f-P vs P-f based Grid-forming Control under RoCoF Event Considering Power and Energy Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) converter is deemed as one enabler for high penetration of renewable energy resources in power system. However, as will be pointed out in this letter, the conventional power-to-frequency (P-f) GFM control will face a dilemma in keeping power limit and grid synchronization when the energy resource of the converter reaches the limit. To address this challenge, a f-P and Q-V hybrid control is proposed, which exhibits similar GFM performance, particularly under weak grid condition, but is superior in power-limiting and grid synchronization as demonstrated by comparative studies.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic and Inertial Combined Navigation Approach Based on Flexible Correction-Model Predictive Control Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a geomagnetic and inertial combined navigation approach based on the flexible correction-model predictive control algorithm (Fc-MPC). This approach aims to overcome the limitations of existing combined navigation methods that require prior geomagnetic maps and the inertial navigation drift of long-range missions. The proposed method uses geomagnetic gradient information and the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with heading control and state constraints, eliminating the dependence on prior geomagnetic maps. Instead, the proposed method achieves real-time measurements of the geomagnetic declination, geomagnetic inclination, and inertial navigation data and introduces uniform compensation conditions to adjust and correct the predictive results in real-time. Simulation and real experiment results demonstrate that the proposed Fc-MPC algorithm significantly improves the precision, efficiency, and stability of the geomagnetic and inertial combined navigation system.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Capacity Expansion for Real-World DER Deployment via End-to-End Network Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of distributed energy resource (DER) devices plays a critical role in distribution grids, offering multiple value streams, including decarbonization, provision of ancillary services, non-wire alternatives, and enhanced grid flexibility. However, existing research on capacity expansion suffers from two major limitations that undermine the realistic accuracy of the proposed models: (i) the lack of modeling of three-phase unbalanced AC distribution networks, and (ii) the absence of explicit treatment of model uncertainty. To address these challenges, we develop a two-stage robust optimization model that incorporates a 3-phase unbalanced power flow model for solving the capacity expansion problem. Furthermore, we integrate a predictive neural network with the optimization model in an end-to-end training framework to handle uncertain variables with provable guarantees. Finally, we validate the proposed framework using real-world power grid data collected from our partner distribution system operators. The experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid framework, which combines the strengths of optimization models and neural networks, provides tractable decision-making support for DER deployments in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage AI-Powered Motif Mining Method for Efficient Power System Topological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph motif, defined as the microstructure that appears repeatedly in a large graph, reveals important topological characteristics of the large graph and has gained increasing attention in power system analysis regarding reliability, vulnerability and resiliency. However, searching motifs within the large-scale power system is extremely computationally challenging and even infeasible, which undermines the value of motif analysis in practice. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage AI-powered motif mining method to enable efficient and wide-range motif analysis in power systems. In the first stage, a representation learning method with specially designed network structure and loss function is proposed to achieve ordered embedding for the power system topology, simplifying the subgraph isomorphic problem into a vector comparison problem. In the second stage, under the guidance of the ordered embedding space, a greedy-search-based motif growing algorithm is introduced to quickly obtain the motifs without traversal searching. A case study based on a power system database including 61 circuit models demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Input-to-State Stability of Newton Methods in Nash Equilibrium Problems with Applications to Game-Theoretic Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove input-to-state stability (ISS) of perturbed Newton methods for generalized equations arising from Nash equilibrium (NE) and generalized NE (GNE) problems. This ISS property allows the use of inexact computation in equilibrium-seeking to enable fast solution tracking in dynamic systems and plays a critical role in the analysis of interconnected plant-optimizer feedback systems such as model predictive control (MPC) with iterative optimization algorithms. For NE problems, we address the local convergence of perturbed Newton methods from the variational inequality (VI) stability analysis and point out that the ISS of the perturbed Josephy-Newton can be established under less restrictive stability/regularity conditions compared to the existing results established for nonlinear optimizations. Agent-distributed Josephy-Newton methods are then developed to enable agent-wise local computations. For GNE problems, since they cannot be reduced to VI problems in general, we use semismooth Newton methods to solve the semismooth equations arising from the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems of the GNE problem and show that the ISS of the perturbed semismooth Newton methods can be established under a quasi-regularity condition. Agent-distributed updates are also developed for the GNE-seeking. To illustrate the use of the ISS in dynamic systems, applications to constrained game-theoretic MPC (CG-MPC) are studied. A real-time CG-MPC solver with both time- and agent- distributed computations is developed and is proven to have bounded solution tracking errors.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Distribution Steering using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal control problems with state distribution constraints have attracted interest for their expressivity, but solutions rely on linear approximations. We approach the problem of driving the state of a dynamical system in distribution from a sequential decision-making perspective. We formulate the optimal control problem as an appropriate Markov decision process (MDP), where the actions correspond to the state-feedback control policies. We then solve the MDP using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). This renders our method suitable for any dynamics model. A key component of our approach is a novel, easy to compute, distance metric in the distribution space that allows our algorithm to guide the distribution of the state. We experimentally test our algorithm under both linear and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Tracking for an Uncertain and Nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE System: Preventing Induced Seismicity in Underground Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust control strategy for output tracking of a nonlinear 3D PDE-ODE system. The output feedback control was developed by bounding the solution and its time derivative for both the infinite-dimensional system and the nonlinear ODE, and leveraging these bounds to ensure the boundedness of the control coefficient and error dynamics perturbations. The mathematical framework demonstrates the controller's ability to manage two output types within the system, overcoming model uncertainties and heterogeneities using minimal system information and a continuous control signal. A case study addressing induced seismicity mitigation while ensuring energy production in the Groningen gas reservoir highlights the control's effectiveness. The strategy guarantees precise tracking of target seismicity rates and pressures across reservoir regions, even under parameter uncertainties. Numerical simulations validate the approach in two scenarios: gas extraction with minimal seismicity and the addition of CO$_2$ injections achieving net-zero environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Tracking control of latent dynamic systems with application to spacecraft attitude control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When intelligent spacecraft or space robots perform tasks in a complex environment, the controllable variables are usually not directly available and have to be inferred from high-dimensional observable variables, such as outputs of neural networks or images. While the dynamics of these observations are highly complex, the mechanisms behind them may be simple, which makes it possible to regard them as latent dynamic systems. For control of latent dynamic systems, methods based on reinforcement learning suffer from sample inefficiency and generalization problems. In this work, we propose an asymptotic tracking controller for latent dynamic systems. The latent variables are related to the high-dimensional observations through an unknown nonlinear function. The dynamics are unknown but assumed to be affine nonlinear. To realize asymptotic tracking, an identifiable latent dynamic model is learned to recover the latents and estimate the dynamics. This training process does not depend on the goals or reference trajectories. Based on the learned model, we use a manually designed feedback linearization controller to ensure the asymptotic tracking property of the closed-loop system. After considering fully controllable systems, the results are extended to the case that uncontrollable environmental latents exist. As an application, simulation experiments on a latent spacecraft attitude dynamic model are conducted to verify the proposed methods, and the observation noise and control deviation are taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Memory-Based Control with Event-Triggered Protocol for interval type-2 fuzzy network system under fading channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the challenges in networked environments and control problems associated with complex nonlinear uncertain systems, this paper investigates the design of a membership-function-dependent (MFD) memory output-feedback (MOF) controller for interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems under fading channels, leveraging a memory dynamic event-triggering mechanism (MDETM). To conserve communication resources, MDETM reduces the frequency of data transmission. For mitigating design conservatism, a MOF controller is employed. A stochastic process models the fading channel, accounting for phenomena such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction that occur during data packet transmission through networks. An actuator failure model addresses potential faults and inaccuracies in practical applications. Considering the impacts of channel fading and actuator failures, the non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) strategy enhances the robustness and anti-interference capability of the MDETM MOF controller. By fully exploiting membership function information, novel MFD control design results ensure mean-square exponential stability and $\mathscr H_{\infty}$ performance $\gamma$ for the closed-loop system. Simulation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security in AmBC-NOMA Networks with Random Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the physical layer security (PLS) of ambient backscatter communication non-orthogonal multiple access (AmBC-NOMA) networks where non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves) are randomly distributed. In the proposed system, a base station (BS) transmits a superimposed signal to a typical NOMA user pair, while a backscatter device~(BD) simultaneously transmits its unique signal by reflecting and modulating the BS's signal. Meanwhile, Eves passively attempt to wiretap the ongoing transmissions. Notably, the number and locations of Eves are unknown, posing a substantial security threat to the system. To address this challenge, the BS injects artificial noise (AN) to mislead the Eves, and a protected zone is employed to create an Eve-exclusion area around the BS. Theoretical expressions for outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) are provided to evaluate the system's reliability-security trade-off. Asymptotic behavior at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is further explored, including the derivation of diversity orders for the OP. Numerical results validate the analytical findings through extensive simulations, demonstrating that both the AN injection and protected zone can effectively enhance PLS. Furthermore, analysis and insights of different key parameters, including transmit SNR, reflection efficiency at the BD, power allocation coefficient, power fraction allocated to desired signal, Eve-exclusion area radius, Eve distribution density, and backscattered AN cancellation efficiency, on OP and IP are also provided.</description>

      <title>A switching Kalman filter approach to online mitigation and correction sensor corruption for inertial navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to detect and address faulty or corrupted external sensors in the context of inertial navigation by leveraging a switching Kalman Filter combined with parameter augmentation. Instead of discarding the corrupted data, the proposed method retains and processes it, running multiple observation models simultaneously and evaluating their likelihoods to accurately identify the true state of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to both identify the moment that a sensor becomes faulty and to correct for the resulting sensor behavior to maintain accurate estimates. We demonstrate our approach on an application of balloon navigation in the atmosphere and shuttle reentry. The results show that our method can accurately recover the true system state even in the presence of significant sensor bias, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of state estimation systems under challenging conditions. We also provide a statistical analysis of problem settings to determine when and where our method is most accurate and where it fails.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Scalability of Bi-static Backscatter Networks for Large Scale Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter radio is a promising technology for low-cost and low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. The conventional monostatic backscatter radio is constrained by its limited communication range, which restricts its utility in wide-area applications. An alternative bi-static backscatter radio architecture, characterized by a dis-aggregated illuminator and receiver, can provide enhanced coverage and, thus, can support wide-area applications. In this paper, we analyze the scalability of the bi-static backscatter radio for large-scale wide-area IoT networks consisting of a large number of unsynchronized, receiver-less tags. We introduce the Tag Drop Rate (TDR) as a measure of reliability and develop a theoretical framework to estimate TDR in terms of the network parameters. We show that under certain approximations, a small-scale prototype can emulate a large-scale network. We then use the measurements from experimental prototypes of bi-static backscatter networks (BNs) to refine the theoretical model. Finally, based on the insights derived from the theoretical model and the experimental measurements, we describe a systematic methodology for tuning the network parameters and identifying the physical layer design requirements for the reliable operation of large-scale bi-static BNs. Our analysis shows that even with a modest physical layer requirement of bit error rate (BER) 0.2, 1000 receiver-less tags can be supported with 99.9% reliability. This demonstrates the feasibility of bi-static BNs for large-scale wide-area IoT applications.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Regret for a Class of Continuous-Time Linear--Quadratic Reinforcement Learning Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17226v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for a class of continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems for diffusions, where states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent but volatilities of the state processes depend on both state and control variables. We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an actor-critic algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one, and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(N^{\frac{3}{4}})$ up to a logarithmic factor, where $N$ is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm. We also perform numerical comparisons between our method and those of the recent model-based stochastic LQ RL studies adapted to the state- and control-dependent volatility setting, demonstrating a better performance of the former in terms of regret bounds.</description>

      <title>Memristor-Based Selective Convolutional Circuit for High-Density Salt-and-Pepper Noise Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a memristor-based selective convolutional (MSC) circuit for salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise removal. We implement its algorithm using memristors in analog circuits. In experiments, we build the MSC model and benchmark it against a ternary selective convolutional (TSC) model. Results show that the MSC model effectively restores images corrupted by SAP noise, achieving similar performance to the TSC model in both quantitative measures and visual quality at noise densities of up to 50%. Note that at high noise densities, the performance of the MSC model even surpasses the theoretical benchmark of its corresponding TSC model. In addition, we propose an enhanced MSC (MSCE) model based on MSC, which reduces power consumption by 57.6% compared with the MSC model while improving performance.</description>

      <title>Enhanced 5G/B5G Network Planning/Optimization deploying RIS in Urban/Outdoor Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the fifth-generation (5G) mobile network has been developed worldwide to remarkably improve network performance and spectral efficiency. Very recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) technology has emerged as an innovative solution for controlling the propagation medium of the forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks. Specifically, RIS takes advantage of the reflected rays on the propagation environment to redirect them to a desired target, improving wireless coverage. To further improve RIS performance, an interesting technique called synchronized transmission with advanced reconfigurable surfaces (STARS) has appeared to allow simultaneous transmission and reflection of intelligent omni-surfaces. With that in mind, this paper introduces an enhanced strategy for the network planning of 5G and beyond (B5G) mobile networks in dense urban scenarios focused on the city of Quito-Ecuador. The efficacy of RIS and its cutting-edge STARS concept is emphasized, providing useful insights into coverage, quality, and throughput results. In particular, this work considers the 3.5/28 GHz frequency bands, optimizing the radio network and anticipating their applicability in B5G networks. Finally, simulation results are also shown, which allow the identification of the benefits of STAR RIS in terms of coverage, signal quality, and data performance.</description>

      <title>M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

      <title>Strategizing Equitable Transit Evacuations: A Data-Driven Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As natural disasters become increasingly frequent, the need for efficient and equitable evacuation planning has become more critical. This paper proposes a data-driven, reinforcement learning-based framework to optimize bus-based evacuations with an emphasis on improving both efficiency and equity. We model the evacuation problem as a Markov Decision Process solved by reinforcement learning, using real-time transit data from General Transit Feed Specification and transportation networks extracted from OpenStreetMap. The reinforcement learning agent dynamically reroutes buses from their scheduled location to minimize total passengers' evacuation time while prioritizing equity-priority communities. Simulations on the San Francisco Bay Area transportation network indicate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in both evacuation efficiency and equitable service distribution compared to traditional rule-based and random strategies. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to enhance system performance and urban resilience during emergency evacuations, offering a scalable solution for real-world applications in intelligent transportation systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the digital modeling and robotic reproduction of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) massage techniques. We adopt an adaptive admittance control algorithm to optimize force and position control, ensuring safety and comfort.

      <title>Teleoperation of Continuum Instruments: Investigation of Linear vs. Angular Commands through Task-Priority Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of teleoperating continuum instruments for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). We develop and adopt a novel task-priority-based kinematic formulation to quantitatively investigate teleoperation commands for continuum instruments under remote center of motion (RCM) constraints. Using redundancy resolution methods, we investigate the kinematic performance during teleoperation, comparing linear and angular commands within a task-priority scheme. For experimental validation, an instrument module (IM) was designed and integrated with a 7-DoF manipulator.
  Assessments, simulations, and experimental validations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The experiments involved several tasks: trajectory tracking of the IM tip along multiple paths with varying priorities for linear and angular teleoperation commands, pushing a ball along predefined paths on a silicon board, following a pattern on a pegboard, and guiding the continuum tip through rings on a ring board using a standard surgical kit.</description>

      <title>PowerMamba: A Deep State Space Model and Comprehensive Benchmark for Time Series Prediction in Electric Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electricity sector is undergoing substantial transformations due to the rising electrification of demand, enhanced integration of renewable energy resources, and the emergence of new technologies. These changes are rendering the electric grid more volatile and unpredictable, making it difficult to maintain reliable operations. In order to address these issues, advanced time series prediction models are needed for closing the gap between the forecasted and actual grid outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a multivariate time series prediction model that combines traditional state space models with deep learning methods to simultaneously capture and predict the underlying dynamics of multiple time series. Additionally, we design a time series processing module that incorporates high-resolution external forecasts into sequence-to-sequence prediction models, achieving this with negligible increases in size and no loss of accuracy. We also release an extended dataset spanning five years of load, electricity price, ancillary service price, and renewable generation. To complement this dataset, we provide an open-access toolbox that includes our proposed model, the dataset itself, and several state-of-the-art prediction models, thereby creating a unified framework for benchmarking advanced machine learning approaches. Our findings indicate that the proposed model outperforms existing models across various prediction tasks, improving state-of-the-art prediction error by an average of 7% and decreasing model parameters by 43%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the bottlenecks preventing Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms (DRL) from real-world applications is how to explore the environment and collect informative transitions efficiently. The present paper describes bounded exploration, a novel exploration method that integrates both 'soft' and intrinsic motivation exploration. Bounded exploration notably improved the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm's performance and its model-based extension's converging speed. It achieved the highest score in 6 out of 8 experiments. Bounded exploration presents an alternative method to introduce intrinsic motivations to exploration when the original reward function has strict meanings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become standard tools in reconnaissance and surveying for both civilian and defense applications. In the future, UAVs will likely play a pivotal role in autonomous package delivery, but current multi-rotor candidates suffer from poor energy efficiency leading to insufficient endurance and range. In order to reduce the power demands of package delivery UAVs while still maintaining necessary hovering capabilities, companies like Amazon are experimenting with hybrid Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) platforms. Tailsitter VTOLs offer a mechanically simple and cost-effective solution compared to other hybrid VTOL configurations, and while advances in hardware and microelectronics have optimized the tailsitter for package delivery, the software behind its operation has largely remained a critical barrier to industry adoption. Tailsitters currently lack a generic, computationally efficient method of control that can provide strong safety and robustness guarantees over the entire flight domain. Further, tailsitters lack a closed-form method of designing dynamically feasible transition maneuvers between hover and cruise. In this paper, we survey the modeling and control methods currently implemented on small-scale tailsitter UAVs, and attempt to leverage a nonlinear dynamic model to design physically realizable, continuous-pitch transition maneuvers at constant altitude. Primary results from this paper isolate potential barriers to constant-altitude transition, and a novel approach to bypassing these barriers is proposed. While initial results are unsuccessful at providing feasible transition, this work acts as a stepping stone for future efforts to design new transition maneuvers that are safe, robust, and computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface-aided Distributed MIMO Radar Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.</description>

Abstract: Conventional electromagnetic induction-based current transformers suffer from issues such as bulky and complex structures, slow response times, and low safety levels. Consequently, researchers have explored combining various sensing technologies with optical fibers to develop optical current transformers that could become the primary choice for power systems in the future. With the maturation of optoelectronic technology, optical current transformers have emerged. They offer outstanding advantages, including high sensitivity, integration, stability, and the ability to operate in complex environments. This review categorizes optical current transformers based on different principles, including all-fiber current transformers, those based on magnetostrictive effects, magneto-optic effects, and thermal effects. It also discusses their principles, structures, manufacturing techniques, and signal processing, while forecasting their future development trends.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the discrete network design problem, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining the corresponding charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to a Kuhn-Tucker-Karush point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links, of which hundreds can be tolled. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce Neo-FREE: a control architecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle from cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes postulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units returning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism that minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the optimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control problem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is nonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for primitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation in an environment with obstacles.</description>

      <title>Stochastic LQR Design With Disturbance Preview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.</description>

      <title>On Pooling-Based Track Fusion Strategies : Harmonic Mean Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a distributed sensor fusion architecture, using standard Kalman filter (naive fusion) can lead to degraded results as track correlations are ignored and conservative fusion strategies are employed as a sub-optimal alternative to the problem. Since, Gaussian mixtures provide a flexible means of modeling any density, therefore fusion strategies suitable for use with Gaussian mixtures are needed. While the generalized covariance intersection (CI) provides a means to fuse Gaussian mixtures, the procedure is cumbersome and requires evaluating a non-integer power of the mixture density. In this paper, we develop a pooling-based fusion strategy using the harmonic mean density (HMD) interpolation of local densities and show that the proposed method can handle both Gaussian and mixture densities without much changes to the framework. Mathematical properties of the proposed fusion strategy are studied and simulated on 2D and 3D maneuvering target tracking scenarios. The simulations suggest that the proposed HMD fusion performs better than other conservative strategies in terms of root-mean-squared error while being consistent.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Mean Density Fusion in Distributed Tracking: Performance and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A distributed sensor fusion architecture is preferred in a real target-tracking scenario as compared to a centralized scheme since it provides many practical advantages in terms of computation load, communication bandwidth, fault-tolerance, and scalability. In multi-sensor target-tracking literature, such systems are better known by the pseudonym - track fusion, since processed tracks are fused instead of raw measurements. A fundamental problem, however, in such systems is the presence of unknown correlations between the tracks, which renders a standard Kalman filter (naive fusion) useless.
  A widely accepted solution is covariance intersection (CI) which provides near-optimal estimates but at the cost of a conservative covariance. Thus, the estimates are pessimistic, which might result in a delayed error convergence. Also, fusion of Gaussian mixture densities is an active area of research where standard methods of track fusion cannot be used. In this article, harmonic mean density (HMD) based fusion is discussed, which seems to handle both of these issues. We present insights on HMD fusion and prove that the method is a result of minimizing average Pearson divergence. This article also provides an alternative and easy implementation based on an importance-sampling-like method without the requirement of a proposal density. Similarity of HMD with inverse covariance intersection is an interesting find, and has been discussed in detail.
  Results based on a real-world multi-target multi-sensor scenario show that the proposed approach converges quickly than existing track fusion algorithms while also being consistent, as evident from the normalized estimation-error squared (NEES) plots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review/tutorial article, we present recent progress on optimal control of partially observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). We first present regularity and continuity conditions for POMDPs and their belief-MDP reductions, where these constitute weak Feller and Wasserstein regularity and controlled filter stability. These are then utilized to arrive at existence results on optimal policies for both discounted and average cost problems, and regularity of value functions. Then, we study rigorous approximation results involving quantization based finite model approximations as well as finite window approximations under controlled filter stability. Finally, we present several recent reinforcement learning theoretic results which rigorously establish convergence to near optimality under both criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.13817v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new real-time intelligent optimization algorithm to minimize the voltage harmonics of a multilevel inverter. Hybrid Genetic algorithm /Particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed in a real-time simulation to identify the best fire angels of the multilevel inverter to eliminate any destructive effect, such as dc voltage variations and changes in line and dc-link resistors. The dual objective function of harmonic minimization and voltage regulation is considered in this real-time simulation. This approach can be applied to any multilevel inverter with various numbers of levels. The validity of the proposed algorithm is proven by real-time simulation of seven and an eleven-level inverter.</description>

      <title>Safe Non-Stochastic Control of Control-Affine Systems: An Online Convex Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to safely control nonlinear control-affine systems that are corrupted with bounded non-stochastic noise, i.e., noise that is unknown a priori and that is not necessarily governed by a stochastic model. We focus on safety constraints that take the form of time-varying convex constraints such as collision-avoidance and control-effort constraints. We provide an algorithm with bounded dynamic regret, i.e., bounded suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows the realization of the noise a prior. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where robots will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unpredictable disturbances such as wind gusts. To develop the algorithm, we capture our problem as a sequential game between a controller and an adversary, where the controller plays first, choosing the control input, whereas the adversary plays second, choosing the noise's realization. The controller aims to minimize its cumulative tracking error despite being unable to know the noise's realization a prior. We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of (i) an inverted pendulum aiming to stay upright, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to fly to a goal location through an unknown cluttered environment.</description>

      <title>Mobility as a Resource (MaaR) for resilient human-centric automation: a vision paper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With technological advances, mobility has been moving from a product (i.e., traditional modes and vehicles), to a service (i.e., Mobility as a Service, MaaS). However, as observed in other fields (e.g. cloud computing resource management) we argue that mobility will evolve from a service to a resource (i.e., Mobility as a Resource, MaaR). Further, due to increasing scarcity of shared mobility spaces across traditional and emerging modes, the transition must be viewed within the critical need for ethical and equitable solutions for the traveling public (i.e., research is needed to avoid hyper-market driven outcomes for society). The evolution of mobility into a resource requires novel conceptual frameworks, technologies, processes and perspectives of analysis. A key component of the future MaaR system is the technological capacity to observe, allocate and manage (in real-time) the smallest envisionable units of mobility (i.e., atomic units of mobility capacity) while providing prioritized attention to human movement and ethical metrics related to access, consumption and impact. To facilitate research into the envisioned future system, this paper proposes initial frameworks which synthesize and advance methodologies relating to highly dynamic capacity reservation systems. Future research requires synthesis across transport network management, demand behavior, mixed-mode usage, and equitable mobility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suboptimal methods in optimal control arise due to a limited computational budget, unknown system dynamics, or a short prediction window among other reasons. Although these methods are ubiquitous, their transient performance remains relatively unstudied. We consider the control of discrete-time, nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and establish sufficient conditions to analyze the finite-time closed-loop performance of such methods in terms of the additional cost incurred due to suboptimality. Finite-time guarantees allow the control design to distribute a limited computational budget over a time horizon and estimate the on-the-go loss in performance due to suboptimality. We study exponential incremental input-to-state stabilizing policies and show that for nonlinear systems, under some mild conditions, this property is directly implied by exponential stability without further assumptions on global smoothness. The analysis is showcased on a suboptimal model predictive control use case.</description>

      <title>Safe Exploration in Reinforcement Learning: Training Backup Control Barrier Functions with Zero Training Time Safety Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the reinforcement learning backup shield (RLBUS), an algorithm that guarantees safe exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating backup control barrier functions (BCBFs). RLBUS constructs an implicit control forward invariant subset of the safe set using multiple backup policies, ensuring safety in the presence of input constraints. While traditional BCBFs often result in conservative control forward-invariant sets due to the design of backup controllers, RLBUS addresses this limitation by leveraging model-free RL to train an additional backup policy, which enlarges the identified control forward invariant subset of the safe set. This approach enables the exploration of larger regions in the state space with zero safety violations during training. The effectiveness of RLBUS is demonstrated on an inverted pendulum example, where the expanded invariant set allows for safe exploration over a broader state space, enhancing performance without compromising safety.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Hybrid SAC for Joint SS-DSA in CRNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opportunistic spectrum access has the potential to increase the efficiency of spectrum utilization in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In CRNs, both spectrum sensing and resource allocation (SSRA) are critical to maximizing system throughput while minimizing collisions of secondary users with the primary network. However, many works in dynamic spectrum access do not consider the impact of imperfect sensing information such as mis-detected channels, which the additional information available in joint SSRA can help remediate. In this work, we examine joint SSRA as an optimization which seeks to maximize a CRN's net communication rate subject to constraints on channel sensing, channel access, and transmit power. Given the non-trivial nature of the problem, we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable a network of secondary users to dynamically access unoccupied spectrum via only local test statistics, formulated under the energy detection paradigm of spectrum sensing. In doing so, we develop a novel multi-agent implementation of hybrid soft actor critic, MHSAC, based on the QMIX mixing scheme. Through experiments, we find that our SSRA algorithm, HySSRA, is successful in maximizing the CRN's utilization of spectrum resources while also limiting its interference with the primary network, and outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a wide margin. We also explore the impact of wireless variations such as coherence time on the efficacy of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive tutorial on a family of Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulations, known as MPC for tracking, which are characterized by including an artificial reference as part of the decision variables in the optimization problem. These formulations have several benefits with respect to the classical MPC formulations, including guaranteed recursive feasibility under online reference changes, as well as asymptotic stability and an increased domain of attraction. This tutorial paper introduces the concept of using an artificial reference in MPC, presenting the benefits and theoretical guarantees obtained by its use. We then provide a survey of the main advances and extensions of the original linear MPC for tracking, including its non-linear extension. Additionally, we discuss its application to learning-based MPC, and discuss optimization aspects related to its implementation.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with measures of nonlinearity. In state estimation, they are utilized i) to select a suitable state estimation algorithm by assessing the nonlinearity of a system model, ii) to adapt the estimation algorithm structure or parameters, or iii) to indicate the possible effect of strong nonlinearity that leads to estimate credibility loss. This paper summarizes the state of the art of nonlinearity measures, focusing on the mean-square-error-based measure of nonlinearity. Its weak point related to unit selection is illustrated, and based on this, requirements for a new measure of nonlinearity are formulated. A new nonlinearity measure that is both unitless and normalized is designed. Its properties are demonstrated using numerical tracking experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address an optimal control problem for linear stochastic systems with unknown noise distributions and joint chance constraints using conformal prediction. Our approach involves designing a feedback controller to maintain an error system within a prediction region (PR). We define PRs as sublevel sets of a nonconformity score over error trajectories, enabling the handling of joint chance constraints. We propose two methods to design feedback control and PRs: one through direct optimization over error trajectory samples, and the other indirectly using the $S$-procedure with a disturbance ellipsoid obtained from data. By tightening constraints with PRs, we solve a relaxed problem to synthesize a feedback policy. Our method ensures reliable probabilistic guarantees based on marginal coverage, independent of data size.</description>

Abstract: Intersections pose critical challenges in traffic management, where maintaining operational constraints and ensuring safety are essential for efficient flow. This paper investigates the effect of intervention timing in management strategies on maintaining operational constraints at intersections while ensuring safe separation distance, avoiding collisions, and minimizing delay. We introduce control regions, represented as circles around the intersection, which refers to the timing of interventions by a centralized control system when agents approach the intersection. We use a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to optimize the system's performance. To analyze the effectiveness of early and late control measures, a simulation study is conducted, focusing on the safe, efficient, and robust management of agent movement within the control regions.</description>

Abstract: The paper considers a Constrained-Informed Neural Network (CINN) approximation for the Time Shift Governor (TSG), which is an add-on scheme to the nominal closed-loop system used to enforce constraints by time-shifting the reference trajectory in spacecraft rendezvous applications. We incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), an emerging architecture in the AI community, as a fundamental component of CINN and propose a Constrained-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CIKAN)-based approximation for TSG. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIKAN-based TSG through simulations of constrained spacecraft rendezvous missions on highly elliptic orbits and present comparisons between CIKANs, MLP-based CINNs, and the conventional TSG.</description>

      <title>Globally convergent homotopies for discrete-time optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homotopy methods are attractive due to their capability of solving difficult optimisation and optimal control problems. The underlying idea is to construct a homotopy, which may be considered as a continuous (zero) curve between the difficult original problem and a related, comparatively easy one. Then, the solution of the easier one is continuously perturbed along the zero curve towards the sought-after solution of the original problem. We propose a methodology for the systematic construction of such zero curves for discrete-time optimal control problems drawing upon the theory of globally convergent homotopies for nonlinear programs. The proposed framework ensures that for almost every initial guess at a solution there exists a suitable homotopy path that is, in addition, numerically convenient to track. We demonstrate the results by solving optimal path planning problems for a linear system and the nonlinear nonholonomic car (Dubins' vehicle).</description>

      <title>Q-Learning for Continuous State and Action MDPs under Average Cost Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For infinite-horizon average-cost criterion problems, there exist relatively few rigorous approximation and reinforcement learning results. In this paper, for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with standard Borel spaces, (i) we first provide a discretization based approximation method for MDPs with continuous spaces under average cost criteria, and provide error bounds for approximations when the dynamics are only weakly continuous (for asymptotic convergence of errors as the grid sizes vanish) or Wasserstein continuous (with a rate in approximation as the grid sizes vanish) under certain ergodicity assumptions. In particular, we relax the total variation condition given in prior work to weak continuity or Wasserstein continuity. (ii) We provide synchronous and asynchronous (quantized) Q-learning algorithms for continuous spaces via quantization (where the quantized state is taken to be the actual state in corresponding Q-learning algorithms presented in the paper), and establish their convergence. (iii) We finally show that the convergence is to the optimal Q values of a finite approximate model constructed via quantization, which implies near optimality of the arrived solution. Our Q-learning convergence results and their convergence to near optimality are new for continuous spaces, and the proof method is new even for finite spaces, to our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Successive Bayesian Reconstructor for Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06551v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>A novel load distribution strategy for aggregators using IoT-enabled mobile devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators (charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss improvement of at least 57.23%.</description>

      <title>Distributed Thompson sampling under constrained communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Bayesian optimization, a black-box function is maximized via the use of a surrogate model. We apply distributed Thompson sampling, using a Gaussian process as a surrogate model, to approach the multi-agent Bayesian optimization problem. In our distributed Thompson sampling implementation, each agent receives sampled points from neighbors, where the communication network is encoded in a graph; each agent utilizes their own Gaussian process to model the objective function. We demonstrate theoretical bounds on Bayesian simple regret and Bayesian average regret, where the bound depends on the structure of the communication graph. Unlike in batch Bayesian optimization, this bound is applicable in cases where the communication graph amongst agents is constrained. When compared to sequential single-agent Thompson sampling, our bound guarantees faster convergence with respect to time as long as the communication graph is connected. We confirm the efficacy of our algorithm with numerical simulations on traditional optimization test functions, illustrating the significance of graph connectivity on improving regret convergence.</description>

      <title>Anytime Acceleration of Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates stepsize-based acceleration of gradient descent with {\em anytime} convergence guarantees. For smooth (non-strongly) convex optimization, we propose a stepsize schedule that allows gradient descent to achieve convergence guarantees of $O(T^{-1.119})$ for any stopping time $T$, where the stepsize schedule is predetermined without prior knowledge of the stopping time. This result provides an affirmative answer to a COLT open problem \citep{kornowski2024open} regarding whether stepsize-based acceleration can yield anytime convergence rates of $o(T^{-1})$. We further extend our theory to yield anytime convergence guarantees of $\exp(-\Omega(T/\kappa^{0.893}))$ for smooth and strongly convex optimization, with $\kappa$ being the condition number.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal Beyond Diagonal RIS: Sum-Rate Maximization in Full-Duplex Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been envisioned as a key technology in future wireless communication networks to enable smart radio environment. To further enhance the passive beamforming capability of RIS, beyond diagonal (BD)-RIS has been proposed considering reconfigurable interconnections among different RIS elements. BD-RIS has a unique feature that cannot be enabled by conventional diagonal RIS; it can be realized by non-reciprocal circuits and thus enables an asymmetric scattering matrix. This feature provides the capability to break the wireless channel reciprocity, and has the potential to benefit full-duplex (FD) systems. In this paper, we model the BD RIS-assisted FD systems, where the impact of BD-RIS non-reciprocity and that of structural scattering, which refers to the specular reflection generated by RIS when the RIS is turned OFF, are explicitly captured. To assess the benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS, we optimise the scattering matrix, precoder and combiner to maximize the DL and UL sum-rates in the FD system. To tackle this optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordination descent (BCD) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Numerical results demonstrate surprising benefits of non-reciprocal BD-RIS that it can achieve much higher DL and UL sum-rates in the FD scenario than reciprocal BD-RIS and conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Linear Regression with Linearly Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotics of linear regression in settings with non-Gaussian covariates where the covariates exhibit a linear dependency structure, departing from the standard assumption of independence. We model the covariates using stochastic processes with spatio-temporal covariance and analyze the performance of ridge regression in the high-dimensional proportional regime, where the number of samples and feature dimensions grow proportionally. A Gaussian universality theorem is proven, demonstrating that the asymptotics are invariant under replacing the non-Gaussian covariates with Gaussian vectors preserving mean and covariance, for which tools from random matrix theory can be used to derive precise characterizations of the estimation error. The estimation error is characterized by a fixed-point equation involving the spectral properties of the spatio-temporal covariance matrices, enabling efficient computation. We then study optimal regularization, overparameterization, and the double descent phenomenon in the context of dependent data. Simulations validate our theoretical predictions, shedding light on how dependencies influence estimation error and the choice of regularization parameters.</description>
