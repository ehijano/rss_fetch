      <title>Modeling Supernova 2023ixf: Lightcurve Degeneracies and Morphological Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova 2023ixf is a type IIP supernova that was observed in May 2023 in the spiral galaxy Messier 101. This was the closest supernova observed of the decade, making this an exciting discovery. Combining the observed brightness and duration with theoretical scaling relations, we model the lightcurve of this supernova in order to reveal the properties of the progenitor star at the time of explosion, including its mass, radius, and explosion energy. We simulate these explosions using the stellar evolution and radiation-hydrodynamics codes MESA+STELLA. We find that SN2023ixf is not easily explained with "normal" stellar evolution, and only models with a small mass of H-rich ejecta can fit the lightcurve. We also find that the late time properties of the lightcurve are better fit by a higher initial-mass star with substantial mass loss during its lifetime, as compared to models with lower initial mass and less mass loss.</description>

      <title>Can metric radio bursts be used as a diagnostics tool for interplanetary coronal mass ejections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric radio bursts are often said to be valuable diagnostic tools for studying the near-sun kinematics and energetics of the Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs). Radio observations also serve as an indirect tool to estimate the coronal magnetic fields. However, how these estimated coronal magnetic fields are related to the magnetic field strength in the ICME at 1 AU has rarely been explored. We aim to establish a relation between the coronal magnetic fields obtained from the radio observations very close to the Sun and the magnetic field measured at 1 AU when the ICME arrives at the Earth. We performed statistical analysis of all metric type II radio bursts in solar cycles 23 and 24, which were found to be associated with ICMEs. We estimated the coronal magnetic field associated with the corresponding CME near the Sun (middle corona) using a split-band radio technique and compared those with the magnetic fields recorded at 1 AU with in-situ observations. We found that the estimated magnetic fields near the Sun using radio techniques are not well correlated with the magnetic fields measured at 1 AU using in-situ observations. This could be due to the complex evolution of the magnetic field as it propagates through the heliosphere. Our results suggest that while metric radio observations can serve as effective proxies for estimating magnetic fields near the Sun, they may not be as effective close to the Earth. At least, no linear relation could be established using metric radio emissions to estimate the magnetic fields at 1 AU with acceptable error margins.</description>

      <title>High-Time-Cadence Spectroscopy and Photometry of Stellar Flares on M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris with Seimei Telescope and TESS. II. Statistical Properties of Blue/Red Asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-dwarfs frequently produce flares, and their associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may threaten the habitability of close-in exoplanets. M-dwarf flares sometimes show prominence eruption signatures, observed as blue/red asymmetries in the H$\alpha$ line. In Paper I, we reported four candidates of prominence eruptions, which shows large diversity in their durations and velocities. In this study, we statistically investigate how blue/red asymmetries are related with their flare and starspot properties, using the dataset from 27 H$\alpha$ flares in Paper I and previously reported 8 H$\alpha$ flares on an M-dwarf YZ Canis Minoris. We found that these asymmetry events tend to show larger H$\alpha$ flare energies compared to non-asymmetry events. In particular, 5 out of 6 blue asymmetry events are not associated with white-light flares, whereas all 7 red asymmetry events are associated with white-light flares. Furthermore, their starspot distributions estimated from the TESS light curve show that all prominence eruption candidates occurred when starspots were located on the stellar disk center as well as on the stellar limb. These results suggest that flares with lower heating rates may have a higher association rate with prominence eruptions and/or the possibility that prominence eruptions are more detectable on the limb than on the disk center on M-dwarfs. These results provide significant insights into CMEs that can affect the habitable world around M-dwarfs.</description>

      <title>3D MHD wave propagation and energy transport in a simulated solar vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport energy throughout the solar atmosphere. Here we investigate the contribution from MHD waves to the Poynting flux in a 3D numerical simulation of a realistic solar atmosphere, modelling a structure resembling a solar vortex tube, using the PLUTO code in the presence of different plasma flow configurations. These simulations feature a closed magnetic loop system where a rotational flow is imposed at one foot-point in addition to photospheric perturbations acting as a wave driver mimicking those of p-modes. We find that a variety of MHD waves exist within the vortex tube, including sausage, kink and torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves, owing to the photospheric wave driver and the nature of the rotational flow itself. We demonstrate how the visual interpretation of different MHD modes becomes non-trivial when a background rotational flow is present compared to a static flux tube. By conducting a simulation both with and without the rotational plasma flow, we demonstrate how the perturbed Poynting flux increases in the presence of the rotational flow as the waves transport increased magnetic energy. We attribute this increase to the dynamical pressure from the rotational flow increasing the plasma density at the tube boundary, which acts to trap the wave energy more effectively inside the vortex. Moreover, we demonstrate how the Poynting flux is always directed upwards in weakly twisted magnetic flux tubes.</description>

      <title>Temporal Variation of Flare Occurrence Rates via the Spot Evolution on the Sun and Solar-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spot evolution on the Sun and solar-type stars is important for understanding the nature of consequential flaring activity. This study statistically investigates the variance of flare occurrence rate through the time evolution of spots on the Sun and solar-type stars. We have compiled the 28-year catalogs of solar flares and their source sunspots obtained from solar surface observations by NOAA and GOES for the Sun. Also, we combined the cataloged stellar flares with the time evolution of starspots estimated by light curves obtained by the 4-year Kepler mission for solar-type stars. For the obtained 24124 solar flares and 180 stellar flares, we calculate the flare occurrence distribution with respect to $t_\mathrm{flare}-t_\mathrm{max}$, which represents the timing of flare through the spot evolution, where $t_\mathrm{flare}$ is the flare occurrence time, and $t_\mathrm{max}$ is the time when the source spot takes its maximum area. When normalized by the spot lifetime, we found that the flare occurrence distribution for $t_\mathrm{flare}-t_\mathrm{max}$ shows a similar distribution regardless of spot size or flare energy, suggesting that the Sun and the solar-type star share the same physical process in the spot-to-flare activity. On this basis, we propose a formula for the time variation of the flare occurrence rate per spot. Also, the correlation between the temporal variation of flare occurrence rate and the time evolution of spot area and the lack of difference in flare occurrence rate between the emergence and decaying phases provide a milestone for the nature of flare-productive spots.</description>

      <title>Sequential ejections of plasma blobs due to unbraiding of tangled loops in the solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoflares, which are consequences of braids in tangled magnetic fields, are an important candidate to heat the solar corona to million degrees. However, their observational evidence is sparse and many of their observational characteristics are yet to be discovered. With the high-resolution observations taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Orbiter, here we study a series of ejections of plasma blobs resulted from a braided magnetic loops in the upper transition region and reveal some critical characteristics of such processes. The cores of these ejections have a size of about 700\,km, a duration less than 1 minute and a speed of about 90\,\kms. An important characteristic is that these plasma blobs are apparently constrained by the post-reconnection magnetic loops, along which they show an extension of up to about 2\,000\,km. The propagation of unbraiding nodes along the main axis of the tangled loops has a speed of about 45\,\kms. The separation angles between the post-reconnection loops and the main axis of the tangled loops are about 30\degree. The observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveal that the braiding loops are upper transition region structures. Based on these observations, the typical magnetic free energy producing a blob is estimated to be about $3.4\times10^{23}$\,erg, well in the nano-flare regime, while the kinematic energy of a blob is about $2.3\times10^{23}$\,erg, suggesting that a majority of magnetic free energy in a magnetic braid is likely transferred into kinematic energy.</description>

      <title>Search for Axions in Magnetic White Dwarf Polarization at Lick and Keck Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most sensitive search to date for light axion-like particles with masses below a micro-eV, using spectropolarimetric data collected from the Lick and Keck Observatories. The conversion of optical photons emitted from the surface of a magnetic white dwarf (MWD) into axions in the strong magnetic field around the star induces a nearly wavelength-independent linear polarization in the observed starlight. We analyze the Stokes parameters $(U, Q, I)$ measured with the Kast spectrograph at the Lick Observatory toward the MWDs SDSS J033320+000720 and ZTF J190132+145807, and with the LRISp-ADC instrument at the Keck Observatory toward ZTF J190132+145807, SDSS J002129+150223, and SDSS J100356+053825 to search for this effect. The data show no evidence of axion-induced linear polarization, and we set world-leading constraints on the axion-photon coupling $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \lesssim 1.7 \times 10^{-12} \,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at the $95\%$ confidence level for masses $m_a \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Spatial Age Distribution of Classical Cepheids in Spiral Galaxies: The Cases of M31 and M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids can be used as age indicators due to well-established period-age and period-age-color relations. \citet{Desomma2021} refined these relations by including a metallicity term and different Mass-Luminosity assumptions.
  In this study, we apply the period-age-metallicity relation for the first time to samples of Classical Cepheids in M31 and M33. For both galaxies, we consider Cepheid coordinates and spatial distributions, along with the metallicity gradients by \citet{Zaritsky1994} and \citet{Magrini2007}, to provide a metallicity estimate for each pulsator. By applying the period-age-metallicity relation, we derive individual ages for each Cepheid.
  Combining these ages and spatial distributions, we construct detailed age maps for both galaxies. Our analysis confirms a radial age gradient, with younger Cepheids preferentially found toward the galactic centers. In M31, we confirm an outer ring at $\sim 11$ kpc, consistent with previous studies, and identify for the first time an inner ring at $\sim 7$ kpc, possibly associated with star formation episodes.
  Comparing age gradients at different angles, we find a consistent general trend of ages increasing monotonically with radius. At the same time, we observe smaller-scale differences, particularly in the $90^\circ$-$180^\circ$ quadrant, suggesting asymmetric star formation and possible dynamical influences. In contrast, M33 displays a steeper global age gradient, indicating a higher concentration of young stars toward its center.
  This study highlights the utility of Cepheids as stellar population tracers, providing insights into the star formation and dynamical evolution of spiral galaxies. Future works will extend this methodology to additional galaxies.</description>

      <title>Testing the Star-disk Collision Model for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the star-disk collision model by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_*$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_*$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_*$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of TOI-3493 b, a sub-Neptune-sized planet on an 8.15-d orbit transiting the bright (V=9.3) G0 star HD 119355 (aka TIC 203377303) initially identified by NASA's TESS space mission. With the aim of confirming the planetary nature of the transit signal detected by TESS and determining the mass of the planet, we performed an intensive Doppler campaign with the HARPS spectrograph, collecting radial velocity measurements. We found that TOI-3493 b lies in a nearly circular orbit and has a mass of 9.0+/-1.2 M_earth and a radius of 3.22+/-0.08 R_earth, implying a bulk density of 1.47+/-0.23 g/cm^3, consistent with a composition comprising a small solid core surrounded by a thick H/He dominated atmosphere.</description>

      <title>A study of Andromeda to improve our knowledge on the evolution and dust production by AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the AGB population of the galaxy M31, based on available HST and Spitzer data,
  to characterize the individual sources in terms of mass, metallicity and formation epoch
  of the progenitors. Particular attention is dedicated to the derivation of the dust
  production rate of the stars, in the attempt of determining the global current dust production
  rate of the galaxy, divided between the silicates and the carbonaceous dust contributions.
  We use results from stellar evolution modelling complemented by the description of the
  dust formation process in the wind, to be used in a population synthesis approach, based on
  the star formation history and age-metallicity relationship obtained in previous investigations.
  The comparison between the results from synthetic modelling and the data available are used
  for the characterization of AGB stars in M31.
  We find that the bulk of the AGB population of M31 is composed by low-mass stars of
  different metallicity formed between 6 Gyr and 14 Gyr ago, with an additional, significant
  contribution from the progeny of 1.7-2.5Msun stars formed during the secondary peak
  in the star formation, which occurred between 1 and 2 Gyr ago. The dust production rate of the
  galaxy is mostly provided by carbon stars, whose contribution is of the order of
  4x10^{-4} Msun/yr, completed by silicates production from massive AGB stars,
  occurring at a rate of 6x10^{-5} Msun/yr. The implications of the present
  results on the reliability of AGB modelling are also commented.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Measurements and Analysis of Double Star System BRT 376</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using new telescope images and archival data, we investigated the positions and motions of the stars in double star system 06160-0745 BRT 376. We found that the two stars share nearly identical parallaxes and exhibit a low relative proper motion, suggesting they move together through space. Furthermore, their combined 3D velocity is less than the calculated escape velocity, indicating they are gravitationally bound rather than just physically near each other. These findings point to 06160-0745 BRT 376 being a true binary system. Future observations will help refine our understanding of its orbital path and further illuminate the nature of stars in close, interacting pairs.</description>

      <title>A prolific solar flare factory. Near-continuous monitoring of an active region nest with Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of active region nests, which are locations on the Sun with recurring flux emergence, are poorly constrained by observations from Earth alone. ESA's Solar Orbiter now monitors the far side of the Sun for extended periods of time. This facilitates observations of the entire Sun. We combined observations from near-Earth satellites and Solar Orbiter to evaluate the contribution of a long-lived active region nest to the global flaring activity of the Sun. We identified a location in Carrington coordinates with episodic bursts of flux emergence throughout 2022. The combined observations allowed a nearly continuous monitoring of this region from April to October, that is, during its most active period. GOES and Solar Orbiter/STIX were used to compare its flaring activity to that of the entire Sun. The region morphology was extracted from SDO/AIA and Solar Orbiter/EUI extreme-ultraviolet images and was combined with magnetic field measurements from SDO/HMI and Solar Orbiter/PHI to assess its unsigned magnetic flux. The active region nest grew in complexity from January to May due to repeated flux emergence events. The peak unsigned magnetic flux was $5\times10^{22}$Mx. The region caused 40% of the observed solar flares in 2022, including five months in which it produced 50-70% of all flares over the entire Sun (in the nearly continuous monitoring window). Of the 17 complex flaring NOAA active regions in 2022, this region contained 10, but they occupied less than 20% of the area in the active latitudes. Active region nests can maintain a high rate of flaring activity for several solar rotations and are more likely to produce complex active regions that can trigger X-class solar flares. Improving the identification and monitoring of long-lived active region nests would benefit space weather forecasts in the short to medium term.</description>
