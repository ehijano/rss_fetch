      <title>Isoperiodic meromorphic forms with at least three simple poles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the connectedness of isoperiodic moduli spaces of meromorphic differentials with at least three simple poles on homologically marked smooth curves whose periods are either not contained in a real line, or not contained in the rational space generated by the peripheral periods. From this topological property we deduce dynamical properties of the underlying foliation in the moduli space meromorphic differentials, by describing leaf closures associated to those spaces.</description>

      <title>Holonomy of affine surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the moduli space of complex affine surfaces with the moduli space of regular meromorphic connections on Riemann surfaces and show that it satisfies a corresponding universal property. As a consequence, we identify the tangent space of the moduli space of affine surfaces, at an affine surface X, with the first hypercohomology of a two-term sequences of sheaves on X. In terms of this identification, we calculate the derivative and coderivative of the holonomy map, sending an affine surface to its holonomy character. Using these formulas, we show that the holonomy map is a submersion at every affine surface that is not a finite-area translation surface, extending work of Veech. Finally, we introduce a holomorphic foliation of some strata of meromorphic affine surfaces, which we call the isoresidual foliation, along whose leave holonomy characters and certain residues are constant. We equip this foliation with a leafwise indefinite Hermitian metric, again extending work of Veech.</description>

      <title>The Canonical Exact Sequence of Differential Modules for 0-Dimensional Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a 0-dimensional scheme $\X$ in $\mathbb{P}^n_K$ over a perfect field $K$, we examine the second differential power of its homogeneous vanishing ideal. This enables us to establish the canonical exact sequence for the associated K\"ahler differential module. We also provide a formula for the Hilbert polynomial of K\"ahler differential modules when $\X$ is either a fat point scheme or a 0-dimensional locally monomial Gorenstein scheme.</description>

      <title>Solvable points on intersections of quadrics, cubics, and quartics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not 2 or 3. We establish polynomial lower bounds on the ambient dimension $N$ for an intersection $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ of quadrics, cubics and quartics to have a dense collection of solvable points, i.e. points in $X(k^{\mathsf{Sol}})$ where $k^{\mathsf{Sol}}/k$ is a solvable closure. Our method connects the classical theory of polar hypersurfaces, as redeveloped by Sutherland, to Fano varieties $\mathcal{F}(j,X)$ of $j$-dimensional linear subspaces on $X$, and we use this to obtain improved control on the arithmetic of $\mathcal{F}(j,X)$.</description>

      <title>Locally non-trivial fibred surfaces with maximal unitary rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f\colon S\to B$ a locally non-trivial fibred surface with fibres of genus $g$. Let $u_f$ be its unitary rank, i.e. the rank of the flat unitary part in the second Fujita decomposition. We study in detail the case when $u_f$ is maximal, i.e. $u_f=g-1$. In this case necessarily $g\leq 6$, but examples in genus $5$ and $6$ are not known, and conjecturally do not exist. We prove a strong slope inequality for these extremal cases. We then use this inequality, together with results on trigonal curves, to give new constraints on the case $g=6$, $u_f=5$. In particular, we prove that the index of the surface is always strictly positive and give strong limitations on the possible classes of the relative canonical divisor</description>

      <title>Graphs with tree decompositions of small graphs and realizing them as the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have been interested in graphs and realizing them as Reeb graphs of explicit real algebraic functions.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the quotient space of the manifold of the domain, regarded as the space consisting of all components of preimages of all single points. Reeb graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry of manifolds since the birth of theory of Morse functions, in the former half of the 20th century. We can easily see that the Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere whose dimension is at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and two edges.
  We are concerned with realizations of graphs decomposed into trees nicely, each vertex of which corresponds to a graph with exactly one edge and two edges or a graph with exactly two edges homeomorphic to a circle.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components of Toric Complete Intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equivariant linear system on a toric variety is a linear system invariant under the torus action. We study the number of irreducible components of the complete intersection of general divisors from a fixed collection of equivariant linear system on a toric variety $X$. An explicit formula for the number of components was obtained by Khovanskii in 2016 for the case $X = T^n$ over $\mathbb C$ and generalized to an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic the author in 2024. Building on these results, we give a recursive formula for an arbitrary toric variety.</description>

      <title>chipfiring: A Python Package for Efficient Mathematical Analysis of Chip-Firing Games on Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents `chipfiring`, a comprehensive Python package for the mathematical analysis of chip-firing games on finite graphs. The package provides a robust toolkit for defining graphs and chip configurations (divisors), performing chip-firing operations, and analyzing fundamental properties such as winnability, linear equivalence, and divisor rank. We detail the core components of the library, including its object-oriented graph and divisor implementations, integrated Laplacian matrix computations, and an efficient implementation of Dhar's algorithm for determining the solvability of the dollar game. The `chipfiring` package is designed for researchers and students in graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, providing essential algorithms and data structures for exploring these rich mathematical models. We describe the library's architecture, illustrate its usage with comprehensive examples, and highlight its specialized contributions compared to general-purpose graph libraries.</description>

      <title>Locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with a flat generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A problem raised by Cuadra and Simson in 2007 asks whether a locally finitely presented Grothendieck category with enough flat objects has enough projective objects. We prove that the categories involved in the statement are precisely the locally finitely presented Grothendieck categories with exact product functors. This enables reformulations of the problem that answer the latter in the negative and prove that it is related to a classical problem posed by Miller in 1975 and to the Telescope Conjecture for compactly generated triangulated categories. Our partial affirmative answers imply that any locally finitely presented Grothendieck category whose subcategory of finitely presented objects is Krull--Schmidt has enough flat objects if, and only if, it has a set of finitely generated projective generators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.01337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an abelian variety $A$ over a finitely generated field $K$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$, we prove that the algebraic rank of $A$ is at most a suitably defined analytic rank. Moreover, we prove that equality, i.e., the BSD rank conjecture, holds for $A/K$ if and only if a suitably defined Tate--Shafarevich group of $A/K$ (1) has finite $\ell$-primary component for some/all $\ell \neq p$, or (2) finite prime-to-$p$ part, or (3) has $p$-primary part of finite exponent, or (4) is of finite exponent. There is an algorithm to verify those conditions for concretely given $A/K$.</description>

Abstract: We study admissible subcategories of the derived categories of smooth noncommutative (nc) curves as classified by Reiten-van den Bergh. We prove that any admissible subcategory of the derived category of a smooth nc curve is again the derived category of a smooth nc curve. We use this result to classify semiorthogonal decompositions in derived categories of nc curves. The results obtained imply that phantom categories do not exist in these cases. As a further application, we prove an extension of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem to the case of orbifold curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum spectrum and Gamma structure for projective bundles, blow-ups, and standard flips. After restricting the quantum multiplication to the exceptional curve direction, we obtain a decomposition of the quantum cohomology of standard flips into asymptotic Gamma classes. We then show that this decomposition is compatible with the semi-orthogonal decompositions for these spaces constructed in work of Orlov and Belmans-Fu-Raedschelders. The proof involves a sequence of reductions to a local model and the asymptotic behavior of Meijer G-functions.</description>

      <title>Effective positivity of Hodge bundles and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new boundedness results across different areas of algebraic geometry, stemming from a unifying technical starting point: bounding the integer $q &gt; 0$ such that the $q$-th Hodge bundle becomes (semi-)positive for families of stable varieties. This result allows us to show that for stable families $f: X \to T$ of maximal variation with klt general fiber and relative dimension $n$ there exist the following bounds:
  1) a lower bound for the Chow-Mumford volume $\left( \lambda_{CM,f} \right)^{\dim T}$ of the form $\delta^{\dim T}$, where $\delta$ is uniform;
  2) a uniform lower bound on $K_{X/T}^{n+1}$, when $T$ is a curve;
  3) an upper bound for $|\mathrm{Aut}(f)|$ when $T$ is a curve, depending uniformly linearly on $K_{X/T}^{n+1}$.
  Additionally, we draw several several consequences on the subspaces of the moduli space of stable varieties parametrizing at least one klt variety, such as the positivity of Hodge bundles and a lower bound on the Chow-Mumford volume in terms of the dimension and the volume of the parametrized varieties (the volume is needed only if working on the coarse moduli space).
  We also give pair versions of the above results with coefficients varying in a DCC set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi-homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus-one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi-homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus-one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements - that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a conjecture on the number of integral points of bounded height on log Fano varieties in analogy with Manin's conjecture on the number of rational points of bounded height on Fano varieties. We also give a prediction for the leading constant which is similar to Peyre's interpretation of the leading constant in Manin's conjecture. We give evidence for our conjecture by proving it for toric varieties. The proof is based on harmonic analysis on universal torsors.</description>

      <title>Labeling abelian varieties over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a deterministic process to associate a practical, permanent label to isomorphism classes of abelian varieties defined over finite fields with commutative endomorphism algebra as long as they are ordinary or defined over a prime field. In the ordinary case, we also provide labels for the polarizations they admit.</description>

      <title>Explicit modularity of K3 surfaces with complex multiplication of large degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the transcendental motive of three K3 surfaces $X$ conjectured to have complex multiplication (CM). Under this assumption, we match these to explicit algebraic Hecke quasi-characters $\psi_X$, and CM abelian threefolds $A$. This provides substantial evidence that a power of $A$ corresponds to $X$ under the Kuga-Satake correspondence.</description>
