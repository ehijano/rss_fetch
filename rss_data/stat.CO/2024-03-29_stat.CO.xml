      <title>Robust estimations from distribution structures: V. Non-asymptotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the complexity of order statistics, the finite sample behaviour of robust statistics is generally not analytically solvable. While the Monte Carlo method can provide approximate solutions, its convergence rate is typically very slow, making the computational cost to achieve the desired accuracy unaffordable for ordinary users. In this paper, we propose an approach analogous to the Fourier transformation to decompose the finite sample structure of the uniform distribution. By obtaining sets of sequences that are consistent with parametric distributions for the first four sample moments, we can approximate the finite sample behavior of other estimators with significantly reduced computational costs. This article reveals the underlying structure of randomness and presents a novel approach to integrate multiple assumptions.</description>

      <title>Taming the Interactive Particle Langevin Algorithm -- the superlinear case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in stochastic optimization have yielded the interactive particle Langevin algorithm (IPLA), which leverages the notion of interacting particle systems (IPS) to efficiently sample from approximate posterior densities. This becomes particularly crucial within the framework of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the E-step is computationally challenging or even intractable. Although prior research has focused on scenarios involving convex cases with gradients of log densities that grow at most linearly, our work extends this framework to include polynomial growth. Taming techniques are employed to produce an explicit discretization scheme that yields a new class of stable, under such non-linearities, algorithms which are called tamed interactive particle Langevin algorithms (tIPLA). We obtain non-asymptotic convergence error estimates in Wasserstein-2 distance for the new class under an optimal rate.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for stochastic oscillatory systems using the phase-corrected Linear Noise Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Likelihood-based inference in stochastic non-linear dynamical systems, such as those found in chemical reaction networks and biological clock systems, is inherently complex and has largely been limited to small and unrealistically simple systems. Recent advances in analytically tractable approximations to the underlying conditional probability distributions enable long-term dynamics to be accurately modelled, and make the large number of model evaluations required for exact Bayesian inference much more feasible. We propose a new methodology for inference in stochastic non-linear dynamical systems exhibiting oscillatory behaviour and show the parameters in these models can be realistically estimated from simulated data. Preliminary analyses based on the Fisher Information Matrix of the model can guide the implementation of Bayesian inference. We show that this parameter sensitivity analysis can predict which parameters are practically identifiable. Several Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are compared, with our results suggesting a parallel tempering algorithm consistently gives the best approach for these systems, which are shown to frequently exhibit multi-modal posterior distributions.</description>
