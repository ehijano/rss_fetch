      <title>Quantifying Circadian Desynchrony in ICU Patients and Its Association with Delirium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Circadian desynchrony characterized by the misalignment between an individual's internal biological rhythms and external environmental cues, significantly affects various physiological processes and health outcomes. Quantifying circadian desynchrony often requires prolonged and frequent monitoring, and currently, an easy tool for this purpose is missing. Additionally, its association with the incidence of delirium has not been clearly explored. Methods: A prospective observational study was carried out in intensive care units (ICU) of a tertiary hospital. Circadian transcriptomics of blood monocytes from 86 individuals were collected on two consecutive days, although a second sample could not be obtained from all participants. Using two public datasets comprised of healthy volunteers, we replicated a model for determining internal circadian time. We developed an approach to quantify circadian desynchrony by comparing internal circadian time and external blood collection time. We applied the model and quantified circadian desynchrony index among ICU patients, and investigated its association with the incidence of delirium. Results: The replicated model for determining internal circadian time achieved comparable high accuracy. The quantified circadian desynchrony index was significantly higher among critically ill ICU patients compared to healthy subjects, with values of 10.03 hours vs 2.50-2.95 hours (p &lt; 0.001). Most ICU patients had a circadian desynchrony index greater than 9 hours. Additionally, the index was lower in patients whose blood samples were drawn after 3pm, with values of 5.00 hours compared to 10.01-10.90 hours in other groups (p &lt; 0.001)...</description>

      <title>In silico clinical trials in drug development: a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of clinical research, computational models have received increasing attention over the past decades. In this systematic review, we aimed to provide an overview of the role of so-called in silico clinical trials (ISCTs) in medical applications. Exemplary for the broad field of clinical medicine, we focused on in silico (IS) methods applied in drug development, sometimes also referred to as model informed drug development (MIDD). We searched PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov for published articles and registered clinical trials related to ISCTs. We identified 202 articles and 48 trials, and of these, 76 articles and 19 trials were directly linked to drug development. We extracted information from all 202 articles and 48 clinical trials and conducted a more detailed review of the methods used in the 76 articles that are connected to drug development. Regarding application, most articles and trials focused on cancer and imaging related research while rare and pediatric diseases were only addressed in 18 and 4 studies, respectively. While some models were informed combining mechanistic knowledge with clinical or preclinical (in-vivo or in-vitro) data, the majority of models were fully data-driven, illustrating that clinical data is a crucial part in the process of generating synthetic data in ISCTs. Regarding reproducibility, a more detailed analysis revealed that only 24% (18 out of 76) of the articles provided an open-source implementation of the applied models, and in only 20% of the articles the generated synthetic data were publicly available. Despite the widely raised interest, we also found that it is still uncommon for ISCTs to be part of a registered clinical trial and their application is restricted to specific diseases leaving potential benefits of ISCTs not fully exploited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive delegation to artificial intelligence (AI) systems is transforming scientific research by enabling the automation of analytical processes and the discovery of new patterns in large datasets. This study examines the ability of AI to complement and expand knowledge in the analysis of breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Building on a previous study, we assess the extent to which AI can generate novel approaches and successfully solve them. For this purpose, AI models, specifically ChatGPT-4o, were used for data preprocessing, hypothesis generation, and the application of clustering techniques, predictive modeling, and correlation network analysis. The results obtained were compared with manually computed outcomes, revealing limitations in process transparency and the accuracy of certain calculations. However, as AI reduces errors and improves reasoning capabilities, an important question arises regarding the future of scientific research: could automation replace the human role in science? This study seeks to open the debate on the methodological and ethical implications of a science dominated by artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Amyloid-beta Targeted Antibodies for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) proteins in the brain, leading to memory loss and cognitive decline. While monoclonal antibodies targeting Abetahave been approved, optimizing their use to maximize benefits while minimizing side effects remains a challenge. This study develops a mathematical model to describe Abeta aggregation, capturing its progression from monomers to toxic oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils using mass-action kinetics and coarse-grained modeling. The model is calibrated with experimental data, incorporating parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis to ensure accuracy. An optimal control framework is introduced to determine the best drug dosing strategy that reduces toxic Abeta aggregates while minimizing adverse effects, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Results indicate that Donanemab achieves the greatest reduction in fibrils. This work provides a quantitative framework for optimizing AD treatment strategies, offering insights into balancing therapeutic efficacy and safety.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Noisy Gene Regulation Dynamics Using Extrinsic-Noise-Driven Neural Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper regulation of cell signaling and gene expression is crucial for maintaining cellular function, development, and adaptation to environmental changes. Reaction dynamics in cell populations is often noisy because of (i) inherent stochasticity of intracellular biochemical reactions (``intrinsic noise'') and (ii) heterogeneity of cellular states across different cells that are influenced by external factors (``extrinsic noise''). In this work, we introduce an extrinsic-noise-driven neural stochastic differential equation (END-nSDE) framework that utilizes the Wasserstein distance to accurately reconstruct SDEs from trajectory data from a heterogeneous population of cells (extrinsic noise). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and experimental data from three different systems in cell biology: (i) circadian rhythms, (ii) RPA-DNA binding dynamics, and (iii) NF$\kappa$B signaling process. Our END-nSDE reconstruction method can model how cellular heterogeneity (extrinsic noise) modulates reaction dynamics in the presence of intrinsic noise. It also outperforms existing time-series analysis methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). By inferring cellular heterogeneities from data, our END-nSDE reconstruction method can reproduce noisy dynamics observed in experiments. In summary, the reconstruction method we propose offers a useful surrogate modeling approach for complex biophysical processes, where high-fidelity mechanistic models may be impractical.</description>

      <title>evoBPE: Evolutionary Protein Sequence Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational biology have drawn compelling parallels between protein sequences and linguistic structures, highlighting the need for sophisticated tokenization methods that capture the intricate evolutionary dynamics of protein sequences. Current subword tokenization techniques, primarily developed for natural language processing, often fail to represent protein sequences' complex structural and functional properties adequately. This study introduces evoBPE, a novel tokenization approach that integrates evolutionary mutation patterns into sequence segmentation, addressing critical limitations in existing methods. By leveraging established substitution matrices, evoBPE transcends traditional frequency-based tokenization strategies. The method generates candidate token pairs through biologically informed mutations, evaluating them based on pairwise alignment scores and frequency thresholds. Extensive experiments on human protein sequences show that evoBPE performs better across multiple dimensions. Domain conservation analysis reveals that evoBPE consistently outperforms standard Byte-Pair Encoding, particularly as vocabulary size increases. Furthermore, embedding similarity analysis using ESM-2 suggests that mutation-based token replacements preserve biological sequence properties more effectively than arbitrary substitutions. The research contributes to protein sequence representation by introducing a mutation-aware tokenization method that better captures evolutionary nuances. By bridging computational linguistics and molecular biology, evoBPE opens new possibilities for machine learning applications in protein function prediction, structural modeling, and evolutionary analysis.</description>

      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Folding for Nearest Neighbor Model Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nearest Neighbor model is the $\textit{de facto}$ thermodynamic model of RNA secondary structure formation and is a cornerstone of RNA structure prediction and sequence design. The current functional form (Turner 2004) contains $\approx13,000$ underlying thermodynamic parameters, and fitting these to both experimental and structural data is computationally challenging. Here, we leverage recent advances in $\textit{differentiable folding}$, a method for directly computing gradients of the RNA folding algorithms, to devise an efficient, scalable, and flexible means of parameter optimization that uses known RNA structures and thermodynamic experiments. Our method yields a significantly improved parameter set that outperforms existing baselines on all metrics, including an increase in the average predicted probability of ground-truth sequence-structure pairs for a single RNA family by over 23 orders of magnitude. Our framework provides a path towards drastically improved RNA models, enabling the flexible incorporation of new experimental data, definition of novel loss terms, large training sets, and even treatment as a module in larger deep learning pipelines. We make available a new database, RNAometer, with experimentally-determined stabilities for small RNA model systems.</description>

      <title>How To Make Your Cell Tracker Say "I dunno!"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell tracking is a key computational task in live-cell microscopy, but fully automated analysis of high-throughput imaging requires reliable and, thus, uncertainty-aware data analysis tools, as the amount of data recorded within a single experiment exceeds what humans are able to overlook. We here propose and benchmark various methods to reason about and quantify uncertainty in linear assignment-based cell tracking algorithms. Our methods take inspiration from statistics and machine learning, leveraging two perspectives on the cell tracking problem explored throughout this work: Considering it as a Bayesian inference problem and as a classification problem. Our methods admit a framework-like character in that they equip any frame-to-frame tracking method with uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate this by applying it to various existing tracking algorithms including the recently presented Transformer-based trackers. We demonstrate empirically that our methods yield useful and well-calibrated tracking uncertainties.</description>

      <title>SCOPE-DTI: Semi-Inductive Dataset Construction and Framework Optimization for Practical Usability Enhancement in Deep Learning-Based Drug Target Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction methods have demonstrated strong performance; however, real-world applicability remains constrained by limited data diversity and modeling complexity. To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.</description>

      <title>RAID-Database: human Responses to Affine Image Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image quality databases are used to train models for predicting subjective human perception. However, most existing databases focus on distortions commonly found in digital media and not in natural conditions. Affine transformations are particularly relevant to study, as they are among the most commonly encountered by human observers in everyday life. This Data Descriptor presents a set of human responses to suprathreshold affine image transforms (rotation, translation, scaling) and Gaussian noise as convenient reference to compare with previously existing image quality databases. The responses were measured using well established psychophysics: the Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling method. The set contains responses to 864 distorted images. The experiments involved 105 observers and more than 20000 comparisons of quadruples of images. The quality of the dataset is ensured because (a) it reproduces the classical Pi\'eron's law, (b) it reproduces classical absolute detection thresholds, and (c) it is consistent with conventional image quality databases but improves them according to Group-MAD experiments.</description>

      <title>FOSS solution for Molecular Dynamics Simulation Automation and Collaboration with MDSGAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The process of setting up and successfully running Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) is outlined to be incredibly labour and computationally expensive with a very high barrier to entry for newcomers wishing to utilise the benefits and insights of MDS. Here, presented, is a unique Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) solution that aims to not only reduce the barrier of entry for new Molecular Dynamics (MD) users, but also significantly reduce the setup time and hardware utilisation overhead for even highly experienced MD researchers. This is accomplished through the creation of the Molecular Dynamics Simulation Generator and Analysis Tool (MDSGAT) which currently serves as a viable alternative to other restrictive or privatised MDS Graphical solutions with a unique design that allows for seamless collaboration and distribution of exact MD simulation setups and initialisation parameters through a single setup file. This solution is designed from the start with a modular mindset allowing for additional software expansion to incorporate numerous extra MDS packages and analysis methods over time</description>
