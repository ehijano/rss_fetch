      <title>The three most common needs for training on measurement uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement uncertainty is key to assessing, stating and improving the reliability of measurements. An understanding of measurement uncertainty is the basis for confidence in measurements and is required by many communities; among others in national metrology institutes, accreditation bodies, calibration and testing laboratories, as well as in legal metrology, at universities and in different metrology fields. An important cornerstone to convey an understanding of measurement uncertainty is to provide training.
  This article identifies the status and the needs for training on measurement uncertainty in each of the above communities as well as among those teaching uncertainty. It is the first study to do so across many different disciplines, and it merges many different sources of information with a focus on Europe. As a result, awareness on the training needs of different communities is raised and teachers of uncertainty are supported in addressing their audiences' needs, in improving their uncertainty-specific pedagogical knowledge and by suggestions for training materials and tools.
  The three needs that are most commonly encountered in the communities requiring an understanding of measurement uncertainty, are 1) to address a general lack of training on measurement uncertainty, 2) to gain a better overview of existing training on measurement uncertainty in several communities, and 3) to deliver more training on specific technical topics including use of a Monte Carlo method for propagating probability distributions and treating multivariate measurands and measurement models.
  These needs will serve to guide future developments in uncertainty training and will, ultimately, contribute to increasing the understanding of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Developing a custom GPT based on Inquiry Based Learning for Physics Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a valuable assistant in many fields such as marketing, finance, project management, and education. In education, many GenAI tools have been developed to aid teachers in preparing proper educational material and offering personalized learning to their students, tailored to their educational needs. In this paper, we present a custom GPT (IBL Educator GPT) that is designed and developed based on Inquiry-based Learning and offers physics teachers a framework in which they can interact with ChatGPT and design educational strategies. The utilization of the IBL Educator GPT has led to an improvement in teachers' perspectives regarding the adoption of artificial intelligence-based tools for personalizing teaching.</description>

      <title>Teaching materials aligned or unaligned with the principles of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning: the choices made by Physics teachers and students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study [Rev. Bras. Ens. F\'is. vol. 45, 2023], the absence of the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML) in the curricula of Physics teacher education programs at Brazilian public universities was highlighted. Considering this gap, the present study investigates whether, even without any formal prior knowledge of CTML principles (Coherence, Signaling, Spatial Contiguity, Segmentation, Multimedia, and Personalization), Physics teacher trainees and educators tend to choose, among two formats of multimedia materials - one aligned with a given CTML principle and the other not - the materials aligned with these principles. The findings of this case study revealed that, although most participants generally selected materials aligned with the mentioned principles, a significant portion did not. These results underscore the importance of Brazilian universities considering the inclusion of CTML in Physics teacher education curricula.</description>

      <title>Modeling the bounce of a gas-filled ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coefficient of restitution $\epsilon$ characterizes the energy retained when a ball bounces, and can easily be measured in an ``at home'' experiment. For thin-walled gas-filled balls such as basketballs, we construct a simple two parameter model to describe how $\epsilon$ changes as a function of the ball's internal pressure. A comparison with data shows good agreement. With additional assumptions, the model also predicts how $\epsilon$ changes as a function of temperature. A comparison with tennis ball data shows surprisingly good agreement.</description>

      <title>Breaking Barriers: Investigating Gender Dynamics in Introductory Physics Lab Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistent underrepresentation of women and other gender minorities in physical science fields has been an ongoing concern. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory physics laboratory courses, specifically exploring whether students of different gender identities exhibit equal inclination and confidence in conducting lab experiments, and whether they face barriers that impact their participation. The study was conducted across three institutions, involving non-physics students enrolled in algebra-based and calculus-based physics courses. Our findings reveal no significant differences in participation levels across genders in various lab activities. However, a subtle yet significant trended was observed: non-male students tend to express greater preferences and comfort levels for note-taking, calculations, and graphing tasks compared to their male counterparts, who gravitated more towards hands-on equipment handling. Although no overt barriers deterring participation based solely on gender were identified, some students reported experiences or witnessed instances where gender dynamics hindered full engagement, such as assumptions about competence or difficulty asserting voices in male-dominated groups. These findings contribute insights into potential gender-based inclinations and experiences within laboratory environments. The results underscore the importance of fostering an inclusive climate that encourages equitable opportunities and engagement from all gender identities in scientific exploration and learning.</description>
