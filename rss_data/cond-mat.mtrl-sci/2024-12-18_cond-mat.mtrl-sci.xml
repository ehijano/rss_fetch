      <title>Atomistic catalyst polarization stemming hydrogen generation from CH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the extremely-sized nanocrystals and nanopores, an adatom M and atomic vacancy V exhibit extraordinary capability of catalysis with however little knowledge about the catalyst-reactant interfacial bonding dynamics. With the aid of DFT calculations, we examined the dehydrogenization of a single CH4 molecule catalyzed using the Rh(111,100), W(110), Ru(0001) surfaces, and monolayer graphene, with and without M or V. It is uncovered in the following three components: (i) catalyst polarization due to atomic under- or hetero-coordination raises the valence band of the catalyst by bond contraction and atomistic dipolar MP and vacancy dipolar V formation; (ii) reactant bond elongation by the interplay of the MP-V = H attraction and MP-V = C repulsion with the = denoting the negative pole of the MP-V; and (iii) reactant conversion, i.e., the scale of H-C elongation, the catalyst valence-band shift, the adsorption energy, and the catalytic activity are proportional to the charge quantity of the MP-V whose local electric field matters.</description>

      <title>Application of machine learning in grain-related clustering of Laue spots in a polycrystalline energy dispersive Laue pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the identification of grain-corresponding Laue reflections in energy dispersive Laue diffraction (EDLD) experiments by formulating it as a clustering problem solvable through unsupervised machine learning (ML). To achieve reliable and efficient identification of grains in a Laue pattern, we employ a combination of clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical clustering (HC) and K-means. These algorithms allow us to group together similar Laue reflections, revealing the underlying grain structure in the diffraction pattern. Additionally, we utilise the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring accurate results. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conducted experiments using both simulated and experimental datasets obtained from nickel wires. The simulated datasets were generated to mimic the characteristics of real-world EDLD experiments, while the experimental datasets were obtained from actual measurements.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Behavior of Transport Properties in Non-Magnetic RuO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a prototypical altermagnet, RuO$_{2}$ has been subject to many controversial reports regarding its magnetic ground state and the existence of crystal Hall effects. We obtained high-quality RuO$_{2}$ single crystal with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 152), and carefully measured its magnetization, longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{yx}$) up to 35 T magnetic field. We also calculated its electronic band, Fermi surface, and conducted numerical simulations for its transport properties. It was found that no magnetic transition occurs below 400 K, and that all the transport properties are consistent with the numerical simulations results, indicating that the magnetotransport properties originate from the intrinsic electronic structures and are dominated by the Lorentz force. Particularly, no crystal Hall effects were observed in our RuO$_{2}$ samples and both magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity follow scaling behavior. These results demonstrate that RuO$_{2}$ is a typical semimetal, rather than an altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behavior of Magnetoresistance and Hall Resistivity in Altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of altermagnet (AM) marks a significant advancement in magnetic materials, combining characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In this Letter, we focus on CrSb, which has been verified to be an AM and to exhibit substantial spin splitting near the Fermi level. After successfully growing high-quality CrSb single crystals, we performed comprehensive magnetization, magnetoresistance (MR), and Hall resistivity measurements, along with the electronic structure, and Fermi surface (FS) calculations, as well as the magneto-transport property numerical simulations. An antiferromagnetic transition occurring at $T_{N}$ = 712 K was reconfirmed. It was found that both experimental MR and Hall resistivity are consistent with the numerical simulation results, and exhibit obvious scaling behavior. The nonlinear Hall resistivity is due to its multi-band structure, rather than an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Especially, the scaling behavior in Hall resistivity is first observed within an AM material. These findings demonstrate that the magneto-transport properties in CrSb originate from the intrinsic electronic structure and are dominated by the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Applications of machine learning in ion beam analysis of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion beam analysis (IBA) is a set of well-established analytical techniques that exploit interactions of swift ion beams (with kinetic energy typically in the order of hundreds of keV up to tens of MeV) with matter, in order to obtain elemental composition and depth profiles in the near-surface region of materials. Machine learning is one of the most important tools in the field of material science, where it can extract valuable insights, make data-driven decisions, and improve overall productivity, making it a vital tool in today's rapidly evolving science. In this paper, I summarize the current status of application of Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) on IBA and demonstrate what kind of benefits we may have by embracing this technology.</description>

      <title>Experimental Confirmation of First-Principles Thermal Conductivity in Zirconium-Doped ThO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degradation of thermal conductivity in advanced nuclear fuels due to the accumulation of fission products and irradiation-induced defects is inevitable, and must be considered as part of safety and efficiency analyses of nuclear reactors. This study examines the thermal conductivity of a zirconium-doped ThO$_2$ crystal, synthesized via the hydrothermal method using a spatial domain thermo-reflectance technique. Zirconium is one of the soluble fission products in oxide fuels that can effectively scatter heat-carrying phonons in the crystalline lattice of fuel. Thus, thermal property measurements of zirconium-doped ThO$_2$ single crystals provide insights into the effects of substitutional zirconium doping, isolated from extrinsic factors such as grain boundary scattering. The experimental results are compared with first-principles calculations of the lattice thermal conductivity of ThO$_2$, employing an iterative solution of the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation. Additionally, the non-perturbative Greens function methodology is utilized to compute phonon-point defect scattering rates, accounting for local distortions around point defects, including mass difference changes, interatomic force constants, and structural relaxation. The congruence between the predicted results from first-principles calculations and the measured temperature-dependent thermal conductivity validates the computational methodology. Furthermore, the methodologies employed in this study enable systematic investigations of thermal conductivity reduction by fission products, potentially leading to the development of more accurate fuel performance codes.</description>

      <title>Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy of Ultrathin Fe(001) Film Grown on CoO(001) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring novel systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is vital for advancing memory devices. In this study, we report an intriguing PMA system involving an ultrathin Fe layer on an antiferromagnetic (AFM) CoO(001) surface. The measured perpendicular anisotropy field is inversely proportional to the Fe thickness, indicating an interfacial origin of PMA. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the antiferromagnetism of CoO has a negligible effect on the PMA. By leveraging the magneto-optical Kerr effect and birefringence effect, we achieved concurrent visualization of ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM domains. A pronounced coupling effect between these domains was observed near the spin reorientation transition, contrasting sharply with areas of stronger PMA that exhibited weak coupling. This research not only establishes a new FM/AFM bilayer PMA system but also significantly advances the understanding of FM/AFM interfacial interactions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials: Origins and progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization in Ni thin films in 1996, laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics have become a prominent research topic in the field of magnetism and spintronics. This development offers new possibilities for the advancement of spintronics and magnetic storage technology. The subject has drawn a substantial number of researchers, leading to a series of research endeavors. Various models have been proposed to elucidate the physical processes underlying laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. However, the potential origins of these processes across different material systems and the true contributions of these different origins remain challenging in the realm of ultrafast spin dynamics. This predicament also hinders the development of spintronic terahertz emitters. In this review, we initially introduce the different experimental methods used in laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics. We then systematically explore the magnetization precession process and present seven models of ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Subsequently, we discuss the physical processes and research status of four ultrafast demagnetization origins (including spin-flipping, spin transport, non-thermal electronic distribution, and laser-induced lattice strain). Since attosecond laser technique and antiferromagnetic materials exhibit promising applications in ultrahigh-frequency spintronics, we acknowledge the emerging studies used by attosecond pules and studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, noting the significant challenges that need to be addressed in these burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>Observing Li Nucleation at Li Metal-Solid Electrolyte Interface in All-Solid-State Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from the significantly improved energy density and safety, all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are considered one of the most promising next-generation energy technologies. Their practical applications, however, are strongly impeded by the Li dendrite formation. Despite this recognized challenge, a comprehensive understanding of Li dendrite nucleation and formation mechanism remains elusive. In particular, the initial locations of Li dendrite formation are still ambiguous: do Li clusters form directly at the Li anode surface, or inside the bulk solid electrolyte (SE), or within the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)? Here, based on the deep-potential molecular dynamics simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques, we investigate the atomic-level mechanism of Li cluster nucleation and formation at the Li anode/SE interface. We observe that an isolated Li cluster initially forms inside the SEI between the Li6PS5Cl SE and the Li metal anode, located ~1 nm away from the Li anode/SEI boundary. The local electronic structure of the spontaneously formed SEI is found to be a key factor enabling the Li cluster formation within SEI, in which a significantly decreased bandgap could facilitate electronic conduction through the SEI and reduce Li+ ions to metallic Li atoms therein. Our work therefore provides atomic-level insights into Li-dendrite nucleation at anode/SE interfaces in ASSLBs, and could guide future design for developing Li-dendrite-inhibiting strategies.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent dynamic nuclear polarization of diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) can increase nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals by orders of magnitude. DNP in diamond proceeds through different DNP mechanisms with a possible temperature-dependence. We report on 13C dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments in diamonds at 3.4 T and 7 T between 300 K and 1.7 K. Nuclear polarization enhancements between 100 and 600 were measured for all temperatures, corresponding to polarizations at 7 T between 0.1% (300 K) and 38% (1.7 K). A strong temperature dependence of the DNP profiles was observed. Longitudinal-detected (LOD) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments revealed an additional broad temperature-dependent electron line centered around the mI = 0 line of the P1 triplet transitions. Our results suggest that nuclei are preferentially polarized via a direct hyperfine mediated polarization transfer while spin diffusion in the sample plays a minor role.</description>

      <title>Barkhausen noise in the columnar hexagonal organic ferroelectric BTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon a polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material, one stable state changes into another which is typically described by a progression of switching events of smaller fractions of the material. These events give rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise and follow a characteristic distribution in their sizes. Barkhausen noise has been studied to better understand the switching processes of ferroelectrics and has been applied for inorganic ferroelectric materials and perovskites. In this work, we present results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations investigating the switching process of the small organic molecular ferroelectric benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs). For temperatures below 175 K and sufficiently strong structural disorder, the system exhibits self-organized critical behavior; for higher temperatures, a creep regime is entered. Our extracted power-law exponents are smaller than those typically measured in inorganic crystals and ceramics which indicates that in the more disordered material BTA larger spanning avalanches are possible. The system was experimentally investigated with a high-sensitivity setup. No Barkhausen noise was observed which is consistent with the simulated event sizes, lying several orders beneath the noise threshold of the experimental setup. This finding corroborates the notion that switching in BTA progresses along the 1D columns in the hexagonal liquid crystal lattice, with little coupling between the columns that could give rise to larger lateral avalanches.</description>

      <title>Barkhausen noise in the organic ferroelectric copolymer P(VDF:TrFE)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material is commonly described as a progression of smaller switching events, giving rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise. While studies on Barkhausen noise, and particularly the associated event size distribution, allow for better understanding of switching processes in ferroelectrics, they were not yet conducted experimentally on organic ferroelectric materials. In this work, Barkhausen noise in the organic ferroelectric copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF:TrFE)) is experimentally investigated under different electric fields, increasing at various rates. A weak dependence of the structure of the Barkhausen noise on both the magnitude and rise time of the applied electric field is observed, which manifests as a trend in the probability density function power-law exponents. Specifically, an increase in maximum electric field leads to an increase of the power-law exponent; increasing the rise time causes a parallel shift towards lower exponents. While these findings do not allow to conclusively confirm or refute universal self-organized critical behavior of the polarization reversal avalanches in P(VDF:TrFE), the exponents were found to seemingly converge to the universal value of 1.5 for fast and strong driving, suggesting the system is close to this limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to control magnetism with strain offers innovative pathways for the modulation of magnetic domain configurations and for the manipulation of magnetic states in materials on the nanoscale. Although the effect of strain on magnetic domains has been recognized since the early work of C. Kittel, detailed local observations have been elusive. Here, we use mechanical strain to achieve reversible control of magnetic textures in a kagome-type Fe3Sn2 ferromagnet without the use of an external electric current or magnetic field in situ in a transmission electron microscope at room temperature. We use Fresnel defocus imaging, off-axis electron holography and micromagnetic simulations to show that tensile strain modifies the structures of dipolar skyrmions and switches their magnetization between out-of-plane and in-plane configurations. We also present quantitative measurements of magnetic domain wall structures and their transformations as a function of strain. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of anisotropy effects and their interplay with magnetoelastic and magnetocrystalline energies, providing new opportunities for the development of strain-controlled devices for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Colossal optical anisotropy in wide-bandgap semiconductor CuAlO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colossal optical anisotropy in the entire visible spectrum is crucial for advanced photonic applications, enabling precise light manipulation without optical loss across a broad spectral range. Here, we demonstrate that CuAlO2 exhibits colossal optical anisotropy and transparency across the visible spectrum, enabled by its unique three-dimensional O-Cu-O dumbbell structure and two-dimensionally confined excitons. Using mm-sized single crystals, we independently measured ab-plane and c-axis optical properties, revealing maximum birefringence (= 3.67) and linear dichroism (= 5.21), the highest reported to date. CuAlO2 retains birefringence over 0.5 throughout the entire visible range and possesses a wide direct bandgap of 3.71 eV, surpassing the birefringence of commercial anisotropic crystals transparent in the visible spectrum. From the two-dimensional screened hydrogen model and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the colossal anisotropy arises from a unique excitonic Cu d-p transition confined to the atomic-thick layer. This colossal optical anisotropy and transparency across the entire visible spectrum makes CuAlO2 a promising candidate for future photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of the sliding ferroelectric switching in hBN with a WSe2 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two BN layers are stacked in parallel in an AB or BA arrangement, a spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization arises due to charge transfer in the out-of-plane B-N bonds. The ferroelectric switching from AB to BA (or BA to AB) can be achieved with a relatively small out-of-plane electric field through the in-plane sliding of one atomic layer over the other. However, the optical detection of such ferroelectric switching in hBN has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, we utilize an adjacent WSe2 monolayer to detect the ferroelectric switching in BN. This dynamic coupling between a 2D ferroelectric and a 2D semiconductor allows for the fundamental investigation of the ferroelectric material using a non-destructive, local optical probe, offering promising applications for compact and non-volatile memory devices.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signatures of magnetization-induced band renormalization and strong spin-charge-lattice coupling in EuZn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an infrared spectroscopy study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator EuZn$_2$As$_2$ over a broad frequency range, spanning temperatures both above and below the AFM transition $T_{\rm N} \simeq$ 20 K. The optical response reveals an insulating behavior, featuring two prominent infrared-active phonon modes at around 95 and 190 cm$^{-1}$, and two subtle absorption peaks at around 130 ($\alpha$ peak) and 2700 cm$^{-1}$ ($\beta$ peak), along with a strong absorption edge rising around 9000 cm$^{-1}$ ($\gamma$ peak). Significantly, the temperature-dependent changes in these peaks show noticeable anomalies across the AFM transition, particularly the emergence of the $\alpha$ peak and an unusual redshift of the $\gamma$ peak, suggesting a strong interaction between the charge excitations and the AFM order. Band structure calculations reveal that these anomalies arise from magnetization-induced band renormalizations, including shifts and foldings. Additionally, both phonon modes feature asymmetric Fano line shapes at low temperatures, with the 95 cm$^{-1}$ phonon mode exhibiting strong coupling to the fluctuations of Eu spins. These findings highlight a complex interplay of spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom in EuZn$_2$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>Bond-Network Entropy Governs Heat Transport in Coordination-Disordered Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the vibrational and thermal properties of solids are influenced by atomistic structural disorder is of fundamental scientific interest, and paramount to designing materials for next-generation energy technologies. While several studies indicate that structural disorder strongly influences the thermal conductivity, the fundamental physics governing the disorder-conductivity relation remains elusive. Here we show that order-of-magnitude, disorder-induced variations of conductivity in network solids can be predicted from a bond-network entropy, an atomistic structural descriptor that quantifies heterogeneity in the topology of the atomic-bond network. We employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport to demonstrate the existence of a relation between the bond-network entropy, and observables such as smoothness of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and macroscopic conductivity. We also show that the smoothing of the VDOS encodes information about the thermal resistance induced by disorder, and can be directly related to phenomenological models for phonon-disorder scattering based on the semiclassical Peierls-Boltzmann equation. Our findings rationalize the conductivity variations of disordered carbon polymorphs ranging from nanoporous electrodes to defective graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.</description>

      <title>Origin of the rich polymorphism of gold in penta-twinned nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the crystallographic structure of penta-twinned gold nanoparticles. Although gold typically exhibits a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice, other phases have been reported in some nanoscale systems. We show that the crystallographic system and the lattice parameters of the gold unit cell strongly depend on the nanoparticle geometry, for a wide size range. Specifically, we show that decahedra exhibit a body-centered tetragonal structure (I4/mmm), whereas rods and bipyramids exhibit a body-centered orthorhombic structure (Immm). These changes in the crystallographic structure are explained by the elastic lattice distortions required to close the mismatch gap in penta-twinned nanoparticles, with respect to fcc single-crystal gold nanoparticles. The effects of nanoparticle shape and size on the surface pressure and the subsequent distortions are additionally discussed.</description>

      <title>N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the N\'eel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the N\'eel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the N\'eel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While intermetallic (IM)-metal interfaces in metallic alloys are critical for tuning mechanical properties, they can also act as failure sites, underscoring the importance of determining their strength. This study reports on a novel microshear geometry, and demonstrates its applicability for testing the strength and deformation behavior of IM-metal interfaces in Mg-Al-Ca alloys, a key material for light weight automotive applications. The shear tests are applied to a model bi-layered system grown by magnetron sputtering, comprising of a CaMg2 film deposited onto a Mg layer. A parametric study was performed using finite element modeling to optimize the specimen dimensions. Subsequently, in situ microshear tests conducted inside a scanning electron microscope revealed an interface shear strength of ~136 MPa, and provided insights into the stages of deformation progression. Post mortem examination of the sheared interface revealed an irregular surface indicating ductile deformation at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Bulk photovoltaic effect in ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases of antimony sulphoiodide investigated by means of ab-initio simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations are employed to study the ferroelectric properties and the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) of antimony sulfur iodide (SbSI). The BPVE enables direct sunlight-to-electricity conversion in homogeneous materials and, in ferroelectric compounds, can be tuned via an electric field controlling the polarization. However, most ferroelectrics are oxides with large band gaps exceeding visible light energy, limiting their photovoltaic performance. Featuring a visible-range band gap, SbSI instead combines remarkable photovoltaic capabilities with a spin-textured band structure, coupling charge and spin degrees of freedom. The calculations predict ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases with comparable band gaps but distinct Rashba-Dresselhaus and Weyl-like spin textures relevant for spintronics. The BPVE is driven by the linear and circular photogalvanic effects, exhibiting large photoconductivities under visible light. Furthermore, it can serve to identify the phase of the material, with the circular photogalvanic effect which also reflects spin-texture changes. With its multifunctional properties, SbSI emerges as a promising material candidate for efficient solar energy conversion and advanced electronics, with potential applications extending to spintronics.</description>

      <title>Phase Segregation Dynamics in Mixed-Halide Perovskites Revealed by Plunge-Freeze Cryogenic Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed-halide lead perovskites, with photoexcited charge-carrier properties suitable for high-efficiency photovoltaics, hold significant promise for high-efficiency tandem solar cells. However, phase segregation under illumination, where an iodide-rich phase forms carrier trap states, remains a barrier to applications. This study employs plunge-freeze cryogenic electron microscopy to visualize nanoscale phase segregation dynamics in CsPb(Br,I) films. By rapidly freezing the illuminated samples, we preserve transient photoexcited ion distributions for high-resolution structural and compositional analysis at the nanoscale. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques (EELS, 4D-STEM) captured the dynamics of photo-induced iodine migration from grain boundaries to centers, identified the buildup of anisotropic strain, and captured the heterogeneous evolution of this process within a single grain. These findings provide new insights into microscopic phase segregation mechanisms and their dynamics, enhancing our understanding of mixed-halide perovskite photostability.</description>

      <title>Electrically driven non-volatile resistance switching between charge density wave states at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over the novel quantum states that emerge from non-equilibrium conditions is of both fundamental and technological importance. Metastable charge density wave (CDW) states are particularly interesting as their electrical manipulation could lead to ultra-efficient memory devices. However, the ability to use electrical pulses for non-volatile resistance switching involving CDW states is exceedingly rare and has been limited to cryogenic temperatures. In this work, we investigate a recently discovered layered semiconductor EuTe4 that exhibits competition between distinct CDW orders that are susceptible to optical manipulation. We report that electrical pulses can be used for excitation to hidden, yet stable electronic states over a broad temperature range between 6 K and 400 K. We find that resistance switching is driven primarily by an electrical field and is fully reversible via a thermal erase procedure. Our experiments show that the pathway for switching is both fast and non-thermal. The resistance of the new electronic state is tuneable by the electrical pulse voltage, so the electronic device acts as a memristor. Our work opens the door for the non-thermal room temperature electrical control of the CDW order and holds great promise for novel memory devices and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic resolution STEM images often suffer from noise due to low electron doses and instrument imperfections, hence it is challenging to obtain critical structural details required for material analysis. To address the problem, we propose a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for denoising STEM images. Our method integrates spectral fidelity, total variation, and brightness/contrast consistency losses to ensure the preservation of fine structures, smooth regions, and physical signal intensities, maintaining the structural integrity of the denoised images. Our proposed method effectively balances noise reduction with the preservation of atomic resolution details and complements existing methods, seeking to enhance the utility of STEM images in material characterization and analysis.</description>

      <title>Field-Resilient Supercurrent Diode in a Multiferroic Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research on supercurrent diodes has surged rapidly due to their potential applications in electronic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. To unlock this functionality, it is essential to find supercurrent diodes that can work consistently at zero magnetic field and under ubiquitous stray fields generated in electronic circuits. However, a supercurrent diode with robust field tolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient supercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson junction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero magnetic field. More importantly, the supercurrent rectification persists over a wide and bipolar magnetic field range beyond industrial standards for field tolerance. By theoretically modeling a multiferroic Josephson junction, we unveil that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and multiferroicity underlies the unusual field resilience of the observed diode effect. This work introduces multiferroic Josephson junctions as a new field-resilient superconducting device for cryogenic electronics.</description>

      <title>AutoSciLab: A Self-Driving Laboratory For Interpretable Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in robotic control and sensing have propelled the rise of automated scientific laboratories capable of high-throughput experiments. However, automated scientific laboratories are currently limited by human intuition in their ability to efficiently design and interpret experiments in high-dimensional spaces, throttling scientific discovery. We present AutoSciLab, a machine learning framework for driving autonomous scientific experiments, forming a surrogate researcher purposed for scientific discovery in high-dimensional spaces. AutoSciLab autonomously follows the scientific method in four steps: (i) generating high-dimensional experiments (x \in R^D) using a variational autoencoder (ii) selecting optimal experiments by forming hypotheses using active learning (iii) distilling the experimental results to discover relevant low-dimensional latent variables (z \in R^d, with d &lt;&lt; D) with a 'directional autoencoder' and (iv) learning a human interpretable equation connecting the discovered latent variables with a quantity of interest (y = f(z)), using a neural network equation learner. We validate the generalizability of AutoSciLab by rediscovering a) the principles of projectile motion and b) the phase transitions within the spin-states of the Ising model (NP-hard problem). Applying our framework to an open-ended nanophotonics challenge, AutoSciLab uncovers a fundamentally novel method for directing incoherent light emission that surpasses the current state-of-the-art (Iyer et al. 2023b, 2020).</description>

      <title>Complex magnetic phases and thermodynamics of CuB_2O_4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The copper metaborate CuB2O4 (CBO) has been studied within the parametric space of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T), showing a series of distinct phases, including commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders, as well as magnetic soliton phases. However, no single study has simultaneously demonstrated all these phases. This work presents the first comprehensive construction of the complex B vs T phase diagram for B = 0-9 T (B perpendicular to the c axis) and T = 0.1-25 K, utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic measurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our findings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles calculations help to gain a deeper and intricate understanding of this complex phase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T regime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange and superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B) sublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground state at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to low temperatures is only 0.76Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin 1/2. Taking CBO as an example, the present work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the formation of complex magnetic phases.</description>

Abstract: Physical insight into a material can be first gained by its color since the reflectance spectrum from an object reflects its microstructure and complex reflective indices. We here present a comprehensive overview of electrodynamics and optics related to reflectance spectra and color and provide an open-source Python code for simulating reflectance spectra and extracting color values. The validity and applicability of the code are demonstrated through comparative analysis with both literature and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Superconductivity: Prediction and Experimental Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of novel superconducting materials is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with a wealth of potential for applications in energy, transportation, and computing. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled expediting the search for new materials by efficiently utilizing vast materials databases. In this study, we developed an approach based on deep learning (DL) to predict new superconducting materials. We have synthesized a compound derived from our DL network and confirmed its superconducting properties in agreement with our prediction. Our approach is also compared to previous work based on random forests (RFs). In particular, RFs require knowledge of the chem-ical properties of the compound, while our neural net inputs depend solely on the chemical composition. With the help of hints from our network, we discover a new ternary compound $\textrm{Mo}_{20}\textrm{Re}_{6}\textrm{Si}_{4}$, which becomes superconducting below 5.4 K. We further discuss the existing limitations and challenges associated with using AI to predict and, along with potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Taming Multi-Domain, -Fidelity Data: Towards Foundation Models for Atomistic Scale Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are changing atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science. Yet, building a single, universal MLIP -- capable of accurately modeling both molecular and crystalline systems -- remains challenging. A central obstacle lies in integrating the diverse datasets generated under different computational conditions. This difficulty creates an accessibility barrier, allowing only institutions with substantial computational resources -- those able to perform costly recalculations to standardize data -- to contribute meaningfully to the advancement of universal MLIPs. Here, we present Total Energy Alignment (TEA), an approach that enables the seamless integration of heterogeneous quantum chemical datasets almost without redundant calculations. Using TEA, we have trained MACE-Osaka24, the first open-source neural network potential model based on a unified dataset covering both molecular and crystalline systems, utilizing the MACE architecture developed by Batatia et al. This universal model shows strong performance across diverse chemical systems, exhibiting comparable or improved accuracy in predicting organic reaction barriers compared to specialized models, while effectively maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for inorganic systems. Our method democratizes the development of universal MLIPs, enabling researchers across academia and industry to contribute to and benefit from high-accuracy potential energy surface models, regardless of their computational resources. This advancement paves the way for accelerated discovery in chemistry and materials science through genuinely foundation models for chemistry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Capacitance in Surfactant Mediated Ion Complexes</title>

Abstract: Ion complexes hold the key for various energy transfer and communication systems in nature and industries. Achieving controllable mechanical and electrical properties in these complex systems is highly desirable but remains challenging. In this work, we propose the use of amphiphilic molecules to mediate salt crystallization. The resultant ionic interfaces can be tunable through reduced surface tensions of crystal facets, an additional intermolecular modifier, and the diffusion-limited crystallization during controlled solvent evaporation. Specifically, we utilized the ionic surfactant Sodium Lauryl sulfoacetate (SLSA) to mediate the crystallization of sodium chloride. Citric acid (CA) was adopted as a hydrogen-bond modifier. Systems mediated by SLSA exhibited the highest capacitance, and a significant enhancement of capacitance was also observed in systems with both SLSA and CA. The substantially increased capacitance of these ionic complexes can be attributed to changes in interfacial and crystalline grain structures. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), optical microscopy (OM), and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) were used to study the effects of surfactant molecules in these ionic complexes. Understanding the role of ionic complexation in defining the thermodynamic and kinetic process of the crystallization process will contribute to better optimization in nucleation and scalability of organic and inorganic crystal production.</description>

      <title>Untangling the Raman spectrum of cubic and tetragonal BaZrO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is a widely used experimental technique to study the vibrational properties of solids. Atomic scale simulations can be used to predict such spectra, but trustworthy studies at finite temperatures are challenging, mainly due to the requirement of accurate and computationally efficient models for the dielectric susceptibility. Here, we have made use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations together with a density functional theory (DFT) based model for the dielectric susceptibility to determine the Raman spectrum of barium zirconate, BaZrO$_3$ (BZO), a well-studied oxide perovskite. At ambient conditions, where the system is cubic, we find excellent agreement with experimentally measured Raman spectra. Our study establishes that the relatively sharp spectra seen experimentally are due to second-order scattering. At higher pressures, where BZO is tetragonal, all first-order Raman active modes are identified. Additionally, slightly below the phase transition, in the cubic phase, a broad "central Raman peak" appears. The origin of this type of peak is controversial and extensively debated in connection to the dynamics of the halide perovskites. Here, we show that it is also present in a "hard" oxide perovskite, and it originates from the highly overdamped R-tilt mode in the cubic structure.</description>

      <title>A finite deformation theory of dislocation thermomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometrically nonlinear theory for field dislocation thermomechanics based entirely on measurable state variables is proposed. Instead of starting from an ordering-dependent multiplicative decomposition of the total deformation gradient tensor, the additive decomposition of the velocity gradient into elastic, plastic and thermal distortion rates is obtained as a natural consequence of the conservation of the Burgers vector. Based on this equation, the theory consistently captures the contribution of transient heterogeneous temperature fields on the evolution of the (polar) dislocation density. The governing equations of the model are obtained from the conservation of Burgers vector, mass, linear and angular momenta, and the First Law. The Second Law is used to deduce the thermodynamical driving forces for dislocation velocity. An evolution equation for temperature is obtained from the First Law and the Helmholtz free energy density, which is taken as a function of the following measurable quantities: elastic distortion, temperature and the dislocation density (the theory allows prescribing additional measurable quantities as internal state variables if needed). Furthermore, the theory allows one to compute the Taylor-Quinney factor, which is material and strain rate dependent. Accounting for the polar dislocation density as a state variable in the Helmholtz free energy of the system allows for temperature solutions in the form of dispersive waves with finite propagation speed, despite using Fourier's law of heat conduction as the constitutive assumption for the heat flux vector.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of palladium hydride via ionic gate-driven protonation using a deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing novel protocols for hydrogen (H) loading is crucial for furthering the investigation of hydrides as potential high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures compared to recent discoveries. Ionic gating-induced protonation (IGP) has emerged as a promising technique for H loading due to its inherent simplicity, but it can be limited in the maximum density of injected H when ionic liquids are used as a gating medium. Additionally, most ionic liquids are limited by high production costs, complex synthesis, and potential toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that large H concentrations can be successfully injected in both palladium (Pd) bulk foils and thin films (up to a stoichiometry PdH$_{0.89}$) by using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline chloride-glycerol 1:3 as gate electrolyte and applying gate voltages in excess of the cathodic stability limit. The attained H concentrations are large enough to induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive transition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd matrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H loading in different materials, although specific details of the applied voltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under investigation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Volterra defects: Geometrical relation between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive mathematical model for Volterra defects and explores their relations using differential geometry on Riemann--Cartan manifolds. Following the standard Volterra process, we derived the Cartan moving frame, a geometric representation of plastic fields, and the associated Riemannian metric using exterior algebra. Although the analysis naturally defines the geometry of three types of dislocations and the wedge disclination, it fails to classify twist disclinations owing to the persistent torsion component, suggesting the need for modifications to the Volterra process. By leveraging the interchangeability of the Weitzenb\"ock and Levi-Civita connections and applying an analytical solution for plasticity derived from the Biot--Savart law, we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the long-standing phenomenological relationship between edge dislocations and wedge disclinations. Additionally, we showcase the effectiveness of novel mathematical tools, including Riemannian holonomy for analysing the Frank vector and complex potentials that encapsulate the topological properties of wedge disclinations as jump discontinuities. Furthermore, we derive analytical expressions for the linearized stress fields of wedge disclinations and confirm their consistency with existing results. These findings demonstrate that the present geometrical framework extends and generalizes the classical theory of Volterra defects.</description>
