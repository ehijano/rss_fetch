      <title>Distribution-Aware Exploration for Adaptive HNSW Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is widely adopted for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) for its ability to deliver high recall with low latency on large-scale, high-dimensional embeddings. The exploration factor, commonly referred to as ef, is a key parameter in HNSW-based vector search that balances accuracy and efficiency. However, existing systems typically rely on manually and statically configured ef values that are uniformly applied across all queries. This results in a distribution-agnostic configuration that fails to account for the non-uniform and skewed nature of real-world embedding data and query workloads. As a consequence, HNSW-based systems suffer from two key practical issues: (i) the absence of recall guarantees, and (ii) inefficient ANNS performance due to over- or under-searching. In this paper, we propose Adaptive-ef (Ada-ef), a data-driven, update-friendly, query-adaptive approach that dynamically configures ef for each query at runtime to approximately meet a declarative target recall with minimal computation. The core of our approach is a theoretically grounded statistical model that captures the similarity distribution between each query and the database vectors. Based on this foundation, we design a query scoring mechanism that distinguishes between queries requiring only small ef and those that need larger ef to meet a target recall, and accordingly assigns an appropriate ef to each query. Experimental results on real-world embeddings produced by state-of-the-art Transformer models from OpenAI and Cohere show that, compared with state-of-the-art learning-based adaptive approaches, our method achieves the target recall while avoiding both over- and under-searching, reducing online query latency by up to 4x, offline computation time by 50x, and offline memory usage by 100x.</description>

      <title>OSM+: Billion-Level Open Street Map Data Processing System for City-wide Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road network data can provide rich information about cities and thus become the base for various urban research. However, processing large volume world-wide road network data requires intensive computing resources and the processed results might be different to be unified for testing downstream tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we process the OpenStreetMap data via a distributed computing of 5,000 cores on cloud services and release a structured world-wide 1-billion-vertex road network graph dataset with high accessibility (opensource and downloadable to the whole world) and usability (open-box graph structure and easy spatial query interface). To demonstrate how this dataset can be utilized easily, we present three illustrative use cases, including traffic prediction, city boundary detection and traffic policy control, and conduct extensive experiments for these three tasks. (1) For the well-investigated traffic prediction tasks, we release a new benchmark with 31 cities (traffic data processed and combined with our released OSM+ road network dataset), to provide much larger spatial coverage and more comprehensive evaluation of compared algorithms than the previously frequently-used datasets. This new benchmark will push the algorithms on their scalability from hundreds of road network intersections to thousands of intersections. (2) While for the more advanced traffic policy control task which requires interaction with the road network, we release a new 6 city datasets with much larger scale than the previous datasets. This brings new challenge for thousand-scale multi-agent coordination. (3) Along with the OSM+ dataset, the release of data converters facilitates the integration of multimodal spatial-temporal data for geospatial foundation model training, thereby expediting the process of uncovering compelling scientific insights.

      <title>A Chunked-Object Pattern for Multi-Region Large Payload Storage in Managed NoSQL Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many managed key-value and NoSQL databases - such as Amazon DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, and Google Cloud Firestore - enforce strict maximum item sizes (e.g., 400 KB in DynamoDB). This constraint imposes significant architectural challenges for applications requiring low-latency, multi-region access to objects that exceed these limits. The standard industry recommendation is to offload payloads to object storage (e.g., Amazon S3) while retaining a pointer in the database. While cost-efficient, this "pointer pattern" introduces network overhead and exposes applications to non-deterministic replication lag between the database and the object store, creating race conditions in active-active architectures.
  This paper presents a "chunked-object" pattern that persists large logical entities as sets of ordered chunks within the database itself. We precisely define the pattern and provide a reference implementation using Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables. The design generalizes to any key-value store with per-item size limits and multi-region replication. We evaluate the approach using telemetry from a production system processing over 200,000 transactions per hour. Results demonstrate that the chunked-object pattern eliminates cross-system replication lag hazards and reduces p99 cross-region time-to-consistency for 1 MB payloads by keeping data and metadata within a single consistency domain.</description>

      <title>Space efficient implementation of hypergraph dualization in the D-basis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new implementation of the $D$-basis algorithm called the Small Space which considerably reduces the algorithm's memory usage for data analysis applications. The previous implementation delivers the complete set of implications that hold on the set of attributes of an input binary table. In the new version, the only output is the frequencies of attributes that appear in the antecedents of implications from the $D$-basis, with a fixed consequent attribute. Such frequencies, rather than the implications themselves, became the primary focus in analysis of datasets where the $D$-basis has been applied over the last decade. The $D$-basis employs a hypergraph dualization algorithm, and a dualization implementation known as Reverse Search allows for the gradual computation of frequencies without the need for storing all discovered implications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Small Space implementation by comparing the runtimes and maximum memory usage of this new version with the current implementation.</description>

      <title>MINES: Explainable Anomaly Detection through Web API Invariant Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the anomalies of web applications, important infrastructures for running modern companies and governments, is crucial for providing reliable web services. Many modern web applications operate on web APIs (e.g., RESTful, SOAP, and WebSockets), their exposure invites intended attacks or unintended illegal visits, causing abnormal system behaviors. However, such anomalies can share very similar logs with normal logs, missing crucial information (which could be in database) for log discrimination. Further, log instances can be also noisy, which can further mislead the state-of-the-art log learning solutions to learn spurious correlation, resulting superficial models and rules for anomaly detection. In this work, we propose MINES which infers explainable API invariants for anomaly detection from the schema level instead of detailed raw log instances, which can (1) significantly discriminate noise in logs to identify precise normalities and (2) detect abnormal behaviors beyond the instrumented logs. Technically, MINES (1) converts API signatures into table schema to enhance the original database shema; and (2) infers the potential database constraints on the enhanced database schema to capture the potential relationships between APIs and database tables. MINES uses LLM for extracting potential relationship based on two given table structures; and use normal log instances to reject and accept LLM-generated invariants. Finally, MINES translates the inferred constraints into invariants to generate Python code for verifying the runtime logs. We extensively evaluate MINES on web-tamper attacks on the benchmarks of TrainTicket, NiceFish, Gitea, Mastodon, and NextCloud against baselines such as LogRobust, LogFormer, and WebNorm. The results show that MINES achieves high recall for the anomalies while introducing almost zero false positives, indicating a new state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Efficient Forkless Blockchain Databases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating nodes in an L1 blockchain remains costly despite recent advances in blockchain technology. One of the most resource-intensive components of a node is the blockchain database, also known as StateDB, that manages balances, nonce, code, and the persistent storage of accounts/smart contracts. Although the blockchain industry has transitioned from forking to forkless chains due to improved consensus protocols, forkless blockchains still rely on legacy forking databases that are suboptimal for their purposes. In this paper, we propose a forkless blockchain database, showing a 100x improvement in storage and a 10x improvement in throughput compared to the geth-based Fantom Blockchain client.</description>

      <title>Supporting Our AI Overlords: Redesigning Data Systems to be Agent-First</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify, i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture, ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new agentic memory stores.</description>
