      <title>System Effects of Carbon-Free Electricity Procurement: Regional Technology and Emissions Impacts of Voluntary Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voluntary carbon-free electricity (CFE) procurement has the potential to accelerate electric sector decarbonization, but procurement strategies vary widely, leading to uncertainty about emissions, investments, and costs. This study assesses the system-wide effects of voluntary CFE procurement on U.S. regional power systems using a detailed energy systems model across a range of program designs, eligible technologies, policy environments, and modeling assumptions. Results suggest that hourly matching, where clean electricity procurement aligns with hourly load, combined with new and local generation could maximize emissions reductions from CFE procurement, particularly under existing Inflation Reduction Act incentives and state policies. However, regional costs vary significantly, with a CFE cost premium ranging from \$11-63/MWh nationally across scenarios and \$1-130/MWh across regions, broader than previous estimates. Expanding the eligible technology portfolio to include renewables, nuclear, carbon capture, and energy storage reduces costs, particularly in regions with lower wind and solar resource quality, though variable renewables and battery storage remain the dominant resources in many scenarios. Additionally, we show that the future policy environment strongly influences the effectiveness of voluntary CFE programs, with more stringent emissions policies or subsidies potentially limiting the incremental benefits of procurement. The analysis also quantifies how features of the model framework can shape insights about CFE procurement strategies.</description>

      <title>Cost Reducing Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage for Long Duration Energy Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration energy storage (LDES) is vital for decarbonizing the energy system but faces economic challenges, including high upfront costs, low trading frequency, and limited revenue in current electricity markets. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is a promising LDES solution, though its economic viability, especially for long storage durations beyond lithium-ion battery capabilities, remains unclear. To address this, here we compiled and analyzed a global emerging adiabatic CAES cost database, showing a continuous cost reduction with an experience rate of 15% as capacities scaled from 10MW to 100MW. Our lifecycle discounted cash flow analysis suggests that adiabatic CAES could achieve economic viability for 10-100 hour storage durations, particularly with optimal geological siting to lower storage costs. This economically viable LDES option will enable large-scale grid balancing and support renewable integration over multi-day periods, making it a valuable asset for advancing deep decarbonization of energy systems.</description>

      <title>A Criminology of Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02895v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the possibility of reaching human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains controversial, the likelihood that the future will be characterized by a society with a growing presence of autonomous machines is high. Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance.</description>

      <title>One pathogen does not an epidemic make: A review of interacting contagions, diseases, beliefs, and stories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15053</link>

Abstract: From pathogens and computer viruses to genes and memes, contagion models have found widespread utility across the natural and social sciences. Despite their success and breadth of adoption, the approach and structure of these models remain surprisingly siloed by field. Given the siloed nature of their development and widespread use, one persistent assumption is that a given contagion can be studied in isolation, independently from what else might be spreading in the population. In reality, countless contagions of biological and social nature interact within hosts (interacting with existing beliefs, or the immune system) and across hosts (interacting in the environment, or affecting transmission mechanisms). Additionally, from a modeling perspective, we know that relaxing these assumptions has profound effects on the physics and translational implications of the models. Here, we review mechanisms for interactions in social and biological contagions, as well as the models and frameworks developed to include these interactions in the study of the contagions. We highlight existing problems related to the inference of interactions and to the scalability of mathematical models and identify promising avenues of future inquiries. In doing so, we highlight the need for interdisciplinary efforts under a unified science of contagions and for removing a common dichotomy between social and biological contagions.</description>

      <title>Harmonious Color Pairings: Insights from Human Preference and Natural Hue Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues, enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent, challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Finally, we analyze our color-pairing score matrix through principal component analysis, which uncovers two complementary hue groups whose interplay underlies the global structure of color-pairing preferences. Together, these findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.</description>
