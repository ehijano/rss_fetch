      <title>Perimetric Contraction on Polygons and Related Fixed Point Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, a new type of mappings called perimetric contractions on $k$-polygons is introduced. These contractions can be viewed as a generalization of mappings that contracts perimeters of triangles. A fixed point theorem for this type of mappings in a complete metric space is established. Achieving a fixed point necessitates the avoidance of periodic points of prime period $2,3,\cdots, k-1$. The class of contraction mappings is encompassed by perimeter-based mappings, leading to the recovery of Banach's fixed point theorem as a direct outcome from our main result. A sufficient condition to guarantee the uniqueness of the fixed point is also provided. Moreover, we introduce the Kannan type perimetric contractions on $k$-polygons, establishing a fixed point theorem and a sufficient uniqueness condition. The relationship between these contractions, generalized Kannan type mappings, and mappings contracting the perimeters on $k$-polygons is investigated. Several examples are illustrated to support the validity of our main results.</description>

      <title>Classes of Baire spaces defined by semi-neighborhoods of the diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the help of semi-neighborhoods of the diagonal, classes of Baire spaces are defined: $\Delta$, $\Delta_h$ and $\Delta_s$ Baire spaces. These classes of spaces are studied with the help of topological games. They are useful in studying continuity in groups: paratopological $\Delta$-Baire groups, quasi-topological $\Delta_h$-Baire groups, and semitopological $\Delta_s$-Baire groups are topological groups.</description>

      <title>Relatively functionally countable subsets of products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is called relatively functionally countable (RFC) in $X$, if for each continuous function $f : X \to \mathbb{R}$ the set $f[A]$ is countable. We prove that all RFC subsets of a product $\prod\limits_{n\in\omega}X_n$ are countable, assuming that spaces $X_n$ are Tychonoff and all RFC subsets of every $X_n$ are countable. In particular, in a metrizable space every RFC subset is countable.
  The main tool in the proof is the following result: for every Tychonoff space $X$ and any countable set $Q \subseteq X$ there is a continuous function $f : X^\omega \to \mathbb{R}^2$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $Q^\omega$ is injective.</description>

      <title>The semi-simple theory of higher rank acylindricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new notion of non-positively curved groups: the collection of discrete countable groups acting (AU-)acylindrically on finite products of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with general type factors. Inspired by the classical theory of ($S$-arithmetic) lattices and the flourishing theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, we show that, up to virtual isomorphism, finitely generated groups in this class enjoy a strongly canonical product decomposition. This semi-simple decomposition also descends to the outer-automorphism group, allowing us to give a partial resolution to a recent conjecture of Sela. We also develop various structure results including a free vs abelian Tits' Alternative, and connections to lattice envelopes. Along the way we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about acylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-1 setting.
  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it contains, for example, $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-1 factors, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, HHGs, groups with property (QT), and is closed under direct products, passing to (totally general type) subgroups, and finite index over-groups.</description>
