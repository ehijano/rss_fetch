      <title>Hate Speech and Sentiment of YouTube Video Comments From Public and Private Sources Covering the Israel-Palestine Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the prevalence of hate speech (HS) and sentiment in YouTube video comments concerning the Israel-Palestine conflict by analyzing content from both public and private news sources. The research involved annotating 4983 comments for HS and sentiments (neutral, pro-Israel, and pro-Palestine). Subsequently, machine learning (ML) models were developed, demonstrating robust predictive capabilities with area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores ranging from 0.83 to 0.90. These models were applied to the extracted comment sections of YouTube videos from public and private sources, uncovering a higher incidence of HS in public sources (40.4%) compared to private sources (31.6%). Sentiment analysis revealed a predominantly neutral stance in both source types, with more pronounced sentiments towards Israel and Palestine observed in public sources. This investigation highlights the dynamic nature of online discourse surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict and underscores the potential of moderating content in a politically charged environment.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Construction of Age-Structured Contact Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing the structure of a population and characterising contacts within the population are key to reliable projections of infectious disease. Two main elements of population structure -- contact heterogeneity and age -- have been repeatedly demonstrated to be key in infection dynamics, yet are rarely combined. Regarding individuals as nodes and contacts as edges within a network provides a powerful and intuitive method to fully realise this population structure. While there are a few key examples of contact networks being measured explicitly, in general we need to construct the appropriate networks from individual-level data. Here, using data from social contact surveys, we develop a generic and robust algorithm to generate an extrapolated network that preserves both age-structured mixing and heterogeneity in the number of contacts. We then use these networks to simulate the spread of infection through the population, constrained to have a given basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and hence a given early growth rate. Given the over-dominant role that highly connected nodes (`superspreaders') would otherwise play in early dynamics, we scale transmission by the average duration of contacts, providing a better match to surveillance data for numbers of secondary cases. This network-based model shows that, for COVID-like parameters, including both heterogeneity and age-structure reduces both peak height and epidemic size compared to models that ignore heterogeneity. Our robust methodology therefore allows for the inclusion of the full wealth of data commonly collected by surveys but frequently overlooked to be incorporated into more realistic transmission models of infectious diseases.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Papers Supported by Disciplinary Grants Garner Deep and Broad Scientific Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research has emerged as a hotbed for innovation and a key approach to addressing complex societal challenges. The increasing dominance of grant-supported research in shaping scientific advances, coupled with growing interest in funding interdisciplinary work, raises fundamental questions about the effectiveness of interdisciplinary grants in fostering high-impact interdisciplinary research outcomes. Here, we quantify the interdisciplinarity of both research grants and publications, capturing 350,000 grants from 164 funding agencies across 26 countries and 1.3 million papers that acknowledged their support from 1985 to 2009. Our analysis uncovers two seemingly contradictory patterns: Interdisciplinary grants tend to produce interdisciplinary papers, which are generally associated with high impact. However, compared to disciplinary grants, interdisciplinary grants on average yield fewer papers and interdisciplinary papers they support tend to have substantially reduced impact. We demonstrate that the key to explaining this paradox lies in the power of disciplinary grants in propelling high-impact interdisciplinary research. Specifically, our results show that highly interdisciplinary papers supported by deeply disciplinary grants garner disproportionately more citations, both within their core disciplines and from broader fields. Moreover, disciplinary grants, particularly when combined with other similar grants, are more effective in producing high-impact interdisciplinary research. Amidst the rapid rise of support for interdisciplinary work across the sciences, these results highlight the hitherto unknown role of disciplinary grants in driving crucial interdisciplinary advances, suggesting that interdisciplinary research requires deep disciplinary expertise and investments.</description>

      <title>Nested stochastic block model for simultaneously clustering networks and nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the nested stochastic block model (NSBM) to cluster a collection of networks while simultaneously detecting communities within each network. NSBM has several appealing features including the ability to work on unlabeled networks with potentially different node sets, the flexibility to model heterogeneous communities, and the means to automatically select the number of classes for the networks and the number of communities within each network. This is accomplished via a Bayesian model, with a novel application of the nested Dirichlet process (NDP) as a prior to jointly model the between-network and within-network clusters. The dependency introduced by the network data creates nontrivial challenges for the NDP, especially in the development of efficient samplers. For posterior inference, we propose several Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms including a standard Gibbs sampler, a collapsed Gibbs sampler, and two blocked Gibbs samplers that ultimately return two levels of clustering labels from both within and across the networks. Extensive simulation studies are carried out which demonstrate that the model provides very accurate estimates of both levels of the clustering structure. We also apply our model to two social network datasets that cannot be analyzed using any previous method in the literature due to the anonymity of the nodes and the varying number of nodes in each network.</description>

      <title>A Test of Time: Predicting the Sustainable Success of Online Collaboration in Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Internet has significantly expanded the potential for global collaboration, allowing millions of users to contribute to collective projects like Wikipedia. While prior work has assessed the success of online collaborations, most approaches are time-agnostic, evaluating success without considering its longevity. Research on the factors that ensure the long-term preservation of high-quality standards in online collaboration is scarce. In this study, we address this gap. We propose a novel metric, `Sustainable Success,' which measures the ability of collaborative efforts to maintain their quality over time. Using Wikipedia as a case study, we introduce the SustainPedia dataset, which compiles data from over 40K Wikipedia articles, including each article's sustainable success label and more than 300 explanatory features such as edit history, user experience, and team composition. Using this dataset, we develop machine learning models to predict the sustainable success of Wikipedia articles. Our best-performing model achieves a high AU-ROC score of 0.88 on average. Our analysis reveals important insights. For example, we find that the longer an article takes to be recognized as high-quality, the more likely it is to maintain that status over time (i.e., be sustainable). Additionally, user experience emerged as the most critical predictor of sustainability. Our analysis provides insights into broader collective actions beyond Wikipedia (e.g., online activism, crowdsourced open-source software), where the same social dynamics that drive success on Wikipedia might play a role. We make all data and code used for this study publicly available for further research.</description>

      <title>Dilemmas and trade-offs in the diffusion of conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outside ideal settings, conventions are shaped by competing processes that can challenge the emergence of norms. This paper identifies three trade-offs challenging the diffusion of conventions: (I) the trade-off between the imperatives of social, sequential, and contextual consistency that individuals balance when choosing between conventions; (II) the competition between local and global coordination, depending on whether individuals coordinate their behavior via interactions throughout a social network or external factors transcending the network; and (III) the balance between decision optimality (e.g., collective satisfaction) and decision costs when collectives with conflicting preferences choose a convention. We develop a broadly applicable statistical physics framework for measuring each of these trade-offs, which we then apply to a sign convention in physics. Our method can recover the structure of the underlying coordination game, the networks of social interactions involved, and the processes through which conflicts are resolved in collaborations. We find that the purpose of conventions may exceed coordination, and that individual preferences towards conventions are concurrently shaped by cultural factors and multiple social networks. Additionally, we reveal the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts. Finally, this work provides a generalization of Lewis' account of conventions.</description>

      <title>Prosocial Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media empower distributed content creation by algorithmically harnessing "the social fabric" (explicit and implicit signals of association) to serve this content. While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue. This paper participates in open and ongoing considerations to translate social and political values and conventions, specifically social cohesion, into platform design. We propose an alternative platform model that includes the social fabric an explicit output as well as input. Citizens are members of communities defined by explicit affiliation or clusters of shared attitudes. Both have internal divisions, as citizens are members of intersecting communities, which are themselves internally diverse. Each is understood to value content that bridge (viz. achieve consensus across) and balance (viz. represent fairly) this internal diversity, consistent with the principles of the Hutchins Commission (1947). Content is labeled with social provenance, indicating for which community or citizen it is bridging or balancing. Subscription payments allow citizens and communities to increase the algorithmic weight on the content they value in the content serving algorithm. Advertisers may, with consent of citizen or community counterparties, target them in exchange for payment or increase in that party's algorithmic weight. Underserved and emerging communities and citizens are optimally subsidized/supported to develop into paying participants. Content creators and communities that curate content are rewarded for their contributions with algorithmic weight and/or revenue. We discuss applications to productivity (e.g. LinkedIn), political (e.g. X), and cultural (e.g. TikTok) platforms.</description>

      <title>The Introduction of README and CONTRIBUTING Files in Open Source Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: README and CONTRIBUTING files can serve as the first point of contact for potential contributors to free/libre and open source software (FLOSS) projects. Prominent open source software organizations such as Mozilla, GitHub, and the Linux Foundation advocate that projects provide community-focused and process-oriented documentation early to foster recruitment and activity. In this paper we investigate the introduction of these documents in FLOSS projects, including whether early documentation conforms to these recommendations or explains subsequent activity. We use a novel dataset of FLOSS projects packaged by the Debian GNU/Linux distribution and conduct a quantitative analysis to examine README (n=4226) and CONTRIBUTING (n=714) files when they are first published into projects' repositories. We find that projects create minimal READMEs proactively, but often publish CONTRIBUTING files following an influx of contributions. The initial versions of these files rarely focus on community development, instead containing descriptions of project procedure for library usage or code contribution. The findings suggest that FLOSS projects do not create documentation with community-building in mind, but rather favor brevity and standardized instructions.</description>

      <title>Power Spectrum Signatures of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point signatures based on the Laplacian operators on graphs, point clouds, and manifolds have become popular tools in machine learning for graphs, clustering, and shape analysis. In this work, we propose a novel point signature, the power spectrum signature, a measure on $\mathbb{R}$ defined as the squared graph Fourier transform of a graph signal. Unlike eigenvectors of the Laplacian from which it is derived, the power spectrum signature is invariant under graph automorphisms. We show that the power spectrum signature is stable under perturbations of the input graph with respect to the Wasserstein metric. We focus on the signature applied to classes of indicator functions, and its applications to generating descriptive features for vertices of graphs. To demonstrate the practical value of our signature, we showcase several applications in characterizing geometry and symmetries in point cloud data, and graph regression problems.</description>
