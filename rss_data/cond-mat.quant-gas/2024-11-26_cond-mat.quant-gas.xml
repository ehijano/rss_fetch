      <title>String breaking mechanism in a lattice Schwinger model simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String breaking is a fundamental concept in gauge theories, describing the decay of a flux string connecting two charges through the production of particle-antiparticle pairs. This phenomenon is particularly important in particle physics, notably in Quantum Chromodynamics, and plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. However, achieving a theoretical understanding of this non-perturbative effect is challenging, as conventional numerical approaches often fall short and require substantial computational resources. On the experimental side, studying these effects necessitates advanced setups, such as high-energy colliders, which makes direct observation difficult. Here, we report an experimental investigation of the string breaking mechanism in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory using an optical lattice quantum simulator. By deterministically preparing initial states of varying lengths with fixed charges at each end, and adiabatically tuning the mass and string tension, we observed in situ microscopic confined phases that exhibit either string or brokenstring states. Further analysis reveals that string breaking occurs under a resonance condition, leading to the creation of new particle-antiparticle pairs. These findings offer compelling evidence of string breaking and provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of lattice gauge theories. Our work underscores the potential of optical lattices as controllable quantum simulators, enabling the exploration of complex gauge theories and their associated phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the anomalous density of a dilute homogeneous Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement of numerical values of the anomalous density, $\sigma$, which plays important role in Bose -- Einstein condensation,
  and, especially, determination of its sign, has been a long standing problem. We develop Hartree -- Fock -- Bogoliubov theory taking account arbitrary phase of the condensate wave function. We show that, the sign of $\sigma$
  directly related to the phase, and, hence is not observable. Despite this, its absolute value can be extracted from measurements of the sound velocity and condensed fraction. We present theoretical prediction
  for $\vert \sigma \vert$ for a BEC in a uniform box.</description>

      <title>Interaction between gravitational waves and trapped Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent proposals for detecting gravitational waves by using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), we investigate the interplay between these two phenomena. A gravitational wave induces a phase shift in the fidelity amplitude of the many-body quantum state. We study the enhancement of the phase shift in the case of Bose condensates confined by an anisotropic harmonic potential, considering both ideal and interacting BEC.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantized vortex in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate at Dirac point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two or more energy bands become degenerate at a singular point in the momentum space, such singularity, or ``Dirac points", gives rise to intriguing quantum phenomena as well as unusual material properties. Systems at the Dirac points can possess topological charges and their unique properties can be probed by various methods, such as transport measurement, interferometry and momentum spectroscopy. While the topology of Dirac point in the momentum space is well studied theoretically, observation of topological defects in a many-body quantum systems at Dirac point remain an elusive goal. Based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a graphene-like optical honeycomb lattice, we directly observe emergence of quantized vortices at the Dirac point. The phase diagram of lattice bosons at the Dirac point is revealed. Our work provides a new way of generating vortices in a quantum gas, and the method is generic and can be applied to different types of optical lattices with topological singularity, especially twisted bilayer optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Peierls state emerging from the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an important effect induced by the particle-lattice interaction, the Peierls transition, a hot topic in condensed matter physics, is usually believed to occur in the one-dimensional fermionic systems. We here study a bosonic version of the one-dimensional Ising-Kondo lattice model, which describes itinerant bosons interact with the localized magnetic moments via only longitudinal Kondo exchange.\ We show that, by means of perturbation analysis and numerical density-matrix renormalization group method, a bosonic analog of the Peierls state can occur in proper parameters regimes. The Peierls state here is characterized by the formation of a long-range spin-density-wave order, the periodicity of which is set by the density of the itinerant bosons. The ground-state phase diagram is mapped out by extrapolating the finite-size results to thermodynamic limit. Apart from the bosonic Peierls state, we also reveal the presence of some other magnetic orders, including a paramagnetic phase and a ferromagnetic phase. We finally propose a possible experimental scheme with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Our results broaden the frontiers of the current understanding of the one-dimensional particle-lattice interaction system.</description>

      <title>Measuring entanglement without local addressing via spiral quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography serves as a key tool for identifying quantum states generated in quantum computers and simulators, typically involving local operations on individual particles or qubits to enable measurements in various bases. However, this approach requires an exponentially larger number of measurement setups as quantum platforms grow in size, highlighting the necessity of more scalable methods to efficiently perform quantum state estimation. Here, we present a tomography scheme that scales far more efficiently and, remarkably, eliminates the need for local addressing of single constituents before measurements. Inspired by the "spin-spiral" structure in magnetic materials, our scheme combines a series of measurement setups, each with different spiraling patterns, with compressed sensing techniques. The results of the numerical simulations demonstrate a high degree of tomographic efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, we show how this method is suitable for the measurement of specific entanglement properties of interesting quantum many-body states, such as entanglement entropy, in various realistic experimental conditions. This method offers a positive outlook across a wide range of quantum platforms, including those in which precise individual operations are challenging, such as optical lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Two-photon cooling of calcium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of calcium atoms using a two-photon transition from the ${^1}S_0$ ground state to the upper $4s5s~{^1}S_0$ state via the ${^1}P_1$ intermediate state. We achieve temperatures as low as $260~\mu\text{K}$ in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), well below the Doppler limit ($T_{\text{D}} = 0.8~\text{mK}$) of the ${^1}P_1$ state. We characterize temperature, lifetime and confinement of the MOT over a range of experimental parameters, observing no reduction in lifetime due to coupling to the higher state. We perform theoretical simulations of the cooling scheme and observe good agreement with the experimental results. The two-photon cooling scheme presented in this work provides an alternative to the standard Doppler cooling applied to alkaline-earth atoms, based on a sequence of two magneto-optical traps. The advantages of our scheme are the possibility of varying the effective linewidth of the ${^1}P_1$ state, a higher transfer efficiency (close to 100$\%$), and a more straightforward experimental implementation.</description>

      <title>Bifurcating solitonic vortices in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The specific geometry of a strip provides connections between solitons and solitonic vortices, which are vortices with a solitonic behaviour in the infinite direction of the strip. We show that there exist stationary solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with k vortices on a transverse line, which bifurcate from the soliton solution as the width of the strip is increased. After decomposing into Fourier series with respect to the transverse variable, the construction of these solitonic vortices is achieved by relying on a careful analysis of the linearized operator around the soliton solution: we apply a fixed point argument to solve the equation in the directions orthogonal to the kernel of the linearized operator, and then handle the direction corresponding to the kernel by an inverse function theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets and Schr\"{o}dinger's cat states in atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explicit realization of quantum droplets, even and odd Schr\"{o}dinger cat states is demonstrated in an atom-molecular Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of interconversion and Kerr non-linear interactions. The crucial roles of both the $\chi^2$-type nonlinearity and chemical potential in the formation of these macroscopic quantum states are shown, where the atomic condensate is in the cat state, with the corresponding molecular wave packet being a quantum droplet. The physical mechanism for their creation and common origin is established to be the non-linearity-induced self-trapping potentials, governed by photoassociation or Feshbach resonance, with the Kerr-type nonlinearities playing subdominant roles. The coexisting and controllable atom and molecular droplets are shown to realize the atom-molecular squeezed state with profiles ranging from Gaussian to flat-top super-Gaussian form. The Wigner functions are exhibited revealing the cat states' phase space interference and squeezing of droplets.</description>

      <title>Realizing Altermagnetism in Fermi-Hubbard Models with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism represents a type of collinear magnetism, that is in some aspects distinct from ferromagnetism and from conventional antiferromagnetism. In contrast to the latter, sublattices of opposite spin are related by spatial rotations and not only by translations and inversions. As a result, altermagnets have spin-split bands leading to unique experimental signatures. Here, we show theoretically how a d-wave altermagnetic phase can be realized with ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices. We propose an altermagnetic Hubbard model with anisotropic next-nearest neighbor hopping and obtain the Hartree-Fock phase diagram. The altermagnetic phase separates in a metallic and an insulating phase and is robust over a large parameter regime. We show that one of the defining characteristics of altermagnetism, the anisotropic spin transport, can be probed with trap-expansion experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mixture of bosons and spin-polarized fermions in two dimensions at zero temperature with a tunable Bose-Fermi attraction. By adopting a diagrammatic T-matrix approach, we analyze the behavior of several thermodynamic quantities for the two species as a function of the density ratio and coupling strength, including the chemical potentials, the momentum distribution functions, the boson condensate density, and the Tan's contact parameter. By increasing the Bose-Fermi attraction, we find that the condensate is progressively depleted and Bose-Fermi pairs form, with a small fraction of condensed bosons surviving even for strong Bose-Fermi attraction. This small condensate proves sufficient to hybridize molecular and atomic states, producing quasi-particles with unusual Fermi liquid features. A nearly universal behavior of the condensate fraction, the bosonic momentum distribution, and Tan's contact parameter with respect to the density ratio is also found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Correlation versus Dissipation in a Non-Hermitian Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the competition between strong correlations and dissipation in quantum impurity systems from the Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime by developing a slave-boson theory for a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss. Notably, in the non-Hermitian Kondo regime, strong correlations qualitatively change the nature of dissipation through renormalization effects, where the effective one-body loss is suppressed and emergent many-body dissipation characterized by the complex-valued hybridization is generated. We unveil the mechanism of a dissipative quantum phase transition of the Kondo state on the basis of this renormalization effect, which counterintuitively enhances the lifetime of the impurity against loss. We also find a crossover from the non-Hermitian Kondo regime to the valence fluctuation regime dominated by one-body dissipation. Our results can be tested in a wide variety of setups such as quantum dots coupled to electronic leads and quantum point contacts in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ponderomotive potential of a bosonic Josephson junction periodically modulated by a high-frequency electromagnetic field. Within the small population difference approximation, the ponderomotive drive induces the well-known Kapitza pendulum effect, stabilizing a $\pi$-phase mode. We discuss the parameter dependence of the dynamical transition from macroscopic quantum self-trapping to $\pi$-Josephson oscillations. Furthermore, we examine the situation where the small population difference approximation fails. In this case, an essential momentum-shortening effect emerges, leading to a stabilized $\pi/2$-phase mode under certain conditions. By mapping this to a classical pendulum scenario, we highlight the uniqueness and limitations of the $\pi/2$-phase mode in bosonic Josephson junctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions and reconnections of vortices are fundamental in many areas of physics, including classical and quantum fluids where they are central to understanding phenomena such as turbulence. In three-dimensional (3D) superfluids, quantum vortices are one-dimensional (1D) filaments that can intersect, reconnect, and recoil with irreversible dynamics described by near-universal scaling laws. We explore quantum-vortex reconnections in a four-dimensional (4D) superfluid, where a vortex is a two-dimensional (2D) surface. Using real-time numerical simulations, we find much richer behaviour than in 3D, including stable intersecting vortex surfaces which do not reconnect, and unusual vortex reconnections which occur without significant energy dissipation, suggesting quasi-reversible dynamics. Our work raises many interesting questions about vortex physics in extra-dimensional systems, and may be extended in the future to more realistic experimental settings where the fourth dimension is simulated with techniques such as synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $p$-wave contacts in an ultracold Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms</title>

Abstract: Using radio-frequency (RF) spectroscopy, we measure the $p$-wave contacts in a Fermi gas of $^6$Li atoms near the $p$-wave Feshbach resonance. The RF spectrum exhibits clear asymptotic behavior, characterized by $\tilde{\omega}^{-1/2}$ and $\tilde{\omega}^{-3/2}$ dependencies. The magnetic-field dependence of the $p$-wave contacts agrees reasonably well with the virial expansion theory in a detuned magnetic field range, validating the theory near the Fermi temperature. The $p$-wave contacts measured in this study constitute a second dataset, complementing the data obtained from the $^{40}$K system and contributing valuable insights into $p$-wave interactions in ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Preparation and observation of anomalous counterpropagating edge states in a periodically driven optical Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of real-space edge modes with ultracold atoms [Braun et al., Nat. Phys. 20, 1306 (2024)], we investigate the preparation and detection of anomalous counterpropagating edge states -- a defining feature of the anomalous Floquet valley-Hall (AFVH) phase -- in a two-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice. Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality in Ising gauge theory entangled with single-component fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the exotic quantum criticality of quasi-two-dimensional single-component fermions at half-filling that are minimally coupled to a dynamical Ising gauge theory. With the numerical matrix product state based infinite density matrix renormalization group method, we discover a robust quantum critical line in the infinite cylinder geometry, where gauge confinement and dimerized translation symmetry breaking emerge simultaneously. We investigate how the transition can be split by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered dimerized phase that is stabilized by additional short-range repulsive interactions. We conjecture a $u(1)$ deconfined criticality scenario, propose a corresponding low-energy effective field theory of the exotic quantum critical point in the two-dimensional limit and identify its shortcomings</description>
