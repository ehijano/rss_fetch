      <title>The Smarr formula within the Geroch-Held-Penrose formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between classical thermodynamics and black hole horizons is a fundamental topic in gravitational physics, offering a potential pathway to understanding quantum aspects of gravity. However, while black hole mechanics exhibits well-known thermodynamic parallels, a rigorous geometric interpretation of thermodynamic variables directly from the field equations warrants further research. In this manuscript, we present a thermodynamic formulation of the field equations through the decomposition of the Riemann tensor, employing the Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalism, to clarify a strong correspondence between black hole thermodynamic variables and geometrical quantities derived from horizon geometry. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic connection between the Penrose and Rindler $K$-curvature and the Smarr relation, motivating a revised definition of both trapping gravity and black hole internal energy. Additionally, we derive through this GHP formalism the Smarr formula for the Reissner-N\"ordstrom black hole cointained in an AdS spacetime and we explore the implications of this relationship for black holes with exotic topologies and in the context of extended theories, exemplified by $f(R)$ gravity. These findings suggest a deeper geometrical basis for black hole thermodynamics, potentially advancing our understanding of gravitational energy, horizon entropy, and their significance within quantum gravity frameworks.</description>

      <title>Constraining inflation with nonminimal derivative coupling with the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array third data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inflation model with nonminimal derivative coupling that features a coupling between the derivative of the inflaton field and the Einstein tensor. This model naturally amplifies curvature perturbations at small scales via gravitationally enhanced friction, a mechanism critical for the formation of primordial black holes and the associated production of potentially detectable scalar-induced gravitational waves. We derive analytical expressions for the primordial power spectrum, enabling efficient exploration of the model parameter space without requiring computationally intensive numerical solutions of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the third data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA DR3), we constrain the model parameters characterizing the coupling function: $\phi_c = 3.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5} M_\mathrm{P}$, $\log_{10} \omega_L = 7.1^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$, and $\log_{10} \sigma = -8.3^{+0.3}_{-0.6}$ at 90\% confidence level. Our results demonstrate the growing capability of pulsar timing arrays to probe early Universe physics, complementing traditional cosmic microwave background observations by providing unique constraints on inflationary dynamics at small scales.</description>

      <title>An Exactly Soluble Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a completion of a corresponding spinfoam model developed earlier; we also show that the HK-GFT admits a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization of the HK model and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Tensorial Model for Fractional Interaction between Dark Matter and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of recent papers it was shown that several aspects of Dark Matter (DM) phenomenology, such as the velocity profiles of individual dwarfs and spiral galaxies, the scaling relations observed in the latter, and the pressure and density profiles of galaxy clusters, can be explained by assuming the DM component in virialized halos to feel a non-local fractional interaction mediated by gravity. Motivated by the remarkable success of this model, in a recent work we have looked for a general relativistic extension, proposing a theory, dubbed Relativistic Scalar Fractional Gravity or RSFG, in which the trace of the DM stress-energy tensor couples to the scalar curvature via a non-local operator constructed with a fractional power of the d'Alembertian. In this work we construct an extension of that model in which also a non-local coupling between the Ricci tensor and the DM stress energy tensor is present. In the action we encode the normalization between these scalar and tensorial term into two operators $F_0(\Box)$ and $F_2(\Box)$, and we derive the general field equations. We then take the weak field limit of the latter, showing that they reduce to general relativity sourced by an effective stress energy tensor, featuring a non local isotropic pressure and anisotropic stress, even if one starts with the assumption of a pressureless DM fluid. Finally, after having worked out the lensing theory in our setup, we test particularly interesting realizations of our framework against the measured convergence profiles of the individual and stacked clusters of the CLASH sample, finding remarkable consistency with the data.</description>

      <title>Microcanonical Phase Space and Entropy in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the structure of microcanonical ensembles in inertial and non-inertial frames attached to a confined system of positive energy particles in curved spacetime. Under certain physically reasonable assumptions that ensure the existence of such ensembles, we derive two generic characteristics of the leading curvature corrections: (1) they are characterized by Ricci and Einstein tensors, and (2) their contribution is proportional to the boundary area of the system. We also obtain exact analytical results for microcanonical ensembles in de Sitter spacetime, which reproduce the perturbative results in the limit $\Lambda \to 0$, but have interesting limits when the size of the system is comparable to ${\Lambda}^{-1/2}$. We give a general argument to highlight two distinct sources of divergences in the phase space volume, coming from redshift and spatial geometry, and illustrate this by comparing and contrasting the results for (i) geodesic box in de Sitter, (ii) geodesic box in Schwarzschild, and (iii) uniformly accelerated box in Minkowski. Finally, we extend these results to $N$ particle systems in the massless (ultra-relativistic) limit for certain restricted class of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Stability of cosmological singularity-free solutions in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a large family of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions in quadratic gravity which are singularity-free at early and late times. This kind of smooth solutions only emerges beyond the unstable de Sitter branch $3\alpha &lt; \beta$, $\alpha$ being the coupling of the $R^2$ term and $-\beta$ the coupling of the $R_{\mu\nu}^2$ term. We have analyzed the stability of these singularity-free solutions by computing the second-order variation of the action. The complete analysis shows that a Big Bang can emerge from a singularity-free regime when the parameters of the theory are slightly modified, revealing the unstable nature of this type of solutions.</description>

      <title>Space-time toy model for Hawking radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By gluing together two sections of flat space-time in different metric representations (with the Minkowski metric representing the region far away from the black hole and the Rindler metric modeling the vicinity of the horizon), we construct a simplified toy model for black-hole evaporation. The simple structure of this toy model allows us to construct exact analytic solutions for the two-point functions in the various vacuum states (Israel-Harte-Hawking, Unruh and Boulware states) in an easy way and thus helps to understand and disentangle the different ingredients for Hawking radiation better.</description>

      <title>Towards an exact approach to pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pulsar timing technique, which compares the observed arrival times of electromagnetic radiation from a pulsar with the predicted arrival times derived from a theoretical model of the pulsar system, is used in pulsar astronomy to infer a multitude of physical information and to constrain possible corrections to General Relativity (GR). The propagation delay is usually computed using formulas based on a post-Newtonian approach, for both the light trajectory and the orbital motion. However, evidence has recently emerged that this approximation may no longer be sufficient when the companion object is a supermassive black hole; deviations from a full GR computation of the propagation delay can reach a few seconds. In this paper, we analyze the case of binary pulsars with a stellar or intermediate black hole companion, whose discovery and timing are key goals of SKA. With a numerical algorithm, we have found that in this case, the full GR value depends only on the semi-major axis of the relative orbit and on the mass of the black hole companion. If the mass of the latter is sufficiently large ($100 M_{\odot}$), the maximum difference between the two approaches is significant ($\sim10^{-7}$ s) even for large binaries ($\sim10^{16}$ cm), and increases up to $\sim 10^{-4}$ s when the mass is $10^5 M_{\odot}$. We also consider relativistic corrections to the orbital motion, and discover that they can strongly affect the value of the propagation delay. We conclude that in the future, post-Newtonian formulas should be replaced with a more accurate approach in these systems, especially in view of future discoveries made by new large telescopes such as SKA.</description>

      <title>Novel electrically charged wormhole, black hole and black bounce exact solutions in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic exploration of exact solutions for electrically charged wormholes, black holes, and black bounces within the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity (HMPG) framework. HMPG combines features of the metric and Palatini formulations of modified gravity, offering a powerful approach to address challenges in General Relativity, particularly those related to cosmic acceleration and dark matter. We examine configurations characterized by a zero scalar potential under spherical symmetry, and present solutions in both the Jordan and Einstein conformal frames. A diverse set of solutions emerges, including traversable wormholes, black holes with extremal horizons, and "black universe" models in which spacetime beyond the horizon leads to an expanding cosmological solution rather than a singularity. Each configuration is categorized according to the properties of the scalar field, with an in-depth analysis of the horizon and throat structures, asymptotic behaviour, and singularities. These findings underscore the versatility of HMPG in capturing complex gravitational phenomena and broadens the scope of the theory, offering a robust framework for modelling gravitational phenomena across a range of astrophysical contexts. Future work will benefit from extending these solutions to include scalar potentials, addressing both early-universe inflation and late-time acceleration, and applying observational data, such as gravitational lensing and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Lyapunov exponent of circular light orbits in black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic systems near black holes satisfy a universal bound, $\lambda \leq \kappa_H$ linking the Lyapunov coefficient $\lambda$ associated with unstable orbits to surface gravity $\kappa_H$ of the event horizon. A natural question is whether this bound is satisfied by unstable circular null geodesics in the vicinity of black holes. However, there are known cases where this bound is violated. It is intriguing to ask whether there exists an alternative universal bound that is valid in such situations. We show that for any spherically symmetric, static black hole that satisfies Einstein's equations and the dominant energy condition, there exist other universal bounds relating the Lyapunov coefficient to a generalized notion of surface gravity at the photon sphere, as well as to the Unruh temperature locally measured by static observers. As applications, we show how these bounds also constrain the imaginary part of quasinormal modes in the eikonal regime and how the Lyapunov coefficient relates to the shadow size and the entropy of the horizon.</description>

      <title>The Fuzzball Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the puzzles that arise in the quantum theory of black holes, and explain how they are resolved in string theory. We review how the Bekenstein entropy is obtained through the count of brane bound states. We describe the fuzzball construction of black hole microstates. These states have no horizon and radiate from their surface like a normal body, so there is no information puzzle. We explain how the semiclassical approximation is violated in gravitational collapse even though curvatures are low at the horizon. This violation happens because the collapse leads to a stretching of space that is {\it fast}: light does not have time to travel across the collapsing region to establish the `vecro' correlations needed in the quantum gravitational vacuum. These vecro correlations arise from the existence of virtual fuzzball fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum, and are significant because of the large degeneracy of fuzzball states implied by the Bekenstein entropy. It is plausible that similar effects of fast expansion may be responsible for effects like dark energy and the Early Dark Energy postulated to explain the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Unlocking new regimes in fractional quantum Hall effect with quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that formulating the composite-fermion theory of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect in terms of quaternions greatly expands its reach and opens the door into many interesting issues that were previously beyond the reach of quantitative theoretical investigation. As an illustration, we investigate the possibility of a nematic or a charge-density wave instability of the composite-fermion Fermi sea at half-filled Landau level and of the nearby FQH states by looking for a magneto-roton instability. Our quaternion formulation of the FQH effect has been inspired by mathematical developments in the theoretical analyses of gravitational wave modes and cosmic microwave background radiation, where an important role is played by spin-weighted spherical harmonics which are nothing but monopole harmonics appearing in the spherical geometry for the FQH effect.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic and Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities of Q-strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear response of Q-strings to perturbations along the cylindrical direction. The results show that the Q-string exhibits dynamical instability when the perturbation wavelength exceeds a threshold $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{c}$. This long-wavelength instability can be characterized by second-order hydrodynamics of viscous fluids and is expected to spontaneously destroy the invariance of the Q-string in the cylindrical direction. More interestingly, at the thin-wall limit, as the configuration of the Q-string approaches a cylinder, this hydrodynamic instability degenerates into the Rayleigh-Plateau instability with a threshold related only to the radius of the cylinder $\lambda_{c}=2\pi R$. Such results reveal the hydrodynamic properties of solitons.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Time Series Clustering for Environmental State Characterization of Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO are large-scale, terrestrial instruments housed in infrastructure that spans a multi-kilometer geographic area and which must be actively controlled to maintain operational stability for long observation periods. Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure, potentially leading to control instabilities or noise artifacts in the detector output. It is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. On a day-to-day basis, the operators monitor several seismically relevant data streams to diagnose operational instabilities and sources of noise using some simple empirically-determined thresholds. It can be untenable for a human operator to monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought. In this paper, we present an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for features-based multivariate time series clustering to achieve this goal and to provide actionable insights to the detector operators by correlating found clusters with events of interest in the detector.</description>

      <title>Exploring the anisotropic gravitational wave background from all-sky mock gravitational wave event catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) serves as a potential probe of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. In this work, we explore the anisotropic SGWB from local ($z &lt; \sim 0.085$) merging stellar mass compact binaries, specifically focusing on merging stellar binary black holes, merging neutron-star-black-hole binaries, and merging binary neutron stars. The analysis employs seven all-sky mock lightcone gravitational wave event catalogues, which are derived from the Millennium simulation combined with a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and a binary population synthesis model. We calculate the angular power spectra $\mathrm{C}_\ell$ at multipole moments $\ell$, expressed as $\text{log}_{10} [\ell(\ell+1)\mathrm{C}_\ell/(2\pi)]$, based on the skymaps of the overdensity $\delta_\mathrm{GW}$ in the anisotropic SGWB. The spectra for all three source types exhibit an approximately linear increase with $\text{log}_{10} \ell$ at higher $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell &gt; \sim 30 - 300$) in seven catalogues, with a characteristic slope of $\sim 2$. The spectra of seven catalogues exhibit considerable variations, arising from fluctuations in spatial distribution, primarily in the radial distribution, of nearby sources (e.g., $&lt; 50$ Mpc/h). After subtracting these nearby sources, the variations become much smaller and the spectra for the three source types become closely aligned (within discrepancies of a factor of $\sim 2$ across $\ell = 1 - 1000$ for all catalogues).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering (euclidean) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, we calculate the one-loop effective action $\Gamma^{1l}_{\rm grav}$ using a spherical background. Usually, this calculation is performed resorting to proper-time regularization within the heat kernel expansion and gives rise to quartically and quadratically UV-sensitive contributions to the vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac}=\frac{\Lambda_{\rm cc}}{8\pi G}$, with $\Lambda_{\rm cc}$ and $G$ cosmological and Newton constant, respectively. We show that, if the measure in the path integral that defines $\Gamma^{1l}_{\rm grav}$ is correctly taken into account, and the physical UV cutoff $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$ properly introduced, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ presents only a (mild) logarithmic sensitivity to $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$. We also consider a free scalar field and a free Dirac field on a spherical gravitational background, and find that the same holds true even in the presence of matter. These results are found without resorting to any supersymmetric embedding of the theory, and shed new light on the cosmological constant problem.</description>

Abstract: Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes the semi-classical limit of non-commutative $U(1)$ gauge theory, characterized by Lie-algebra-type non-commutativity. We focus on the mechanics of a charged point-like particle moving in a given gauge background. First, we derive explicit expressions for gauge-invariant variables representing the particle's position. Second, we provide a detailed formulation of the classical action and the corresponding equations of motion, which recover standard relativistic dynamics in the commutative limit. We illustrate our findings by exploring the exactly solvable Kepler problem in the context of the $\lambda$-Minkowski (or the angular) non-commutativity, along with other examples.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Viscous Hydrodynamics in the Density Frame: Numerical Tests and Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a numerical study of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics in the Density Frame for one-dimensional fluid flows. The Density Frame is a formulation of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics that is first-order in time, requires no auxiliary fields, and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. We compare our results to QCD kinetic theory simulations and find excellent agreement within the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics. Additionally, the Density Frame results remain well-behaved and robust near the boundary of applicability. We also compare our findings to the second-order-in-time hydrodynamic theory developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK) and a well-known M\"uller-Israel-Stewart-type hydrodynamics code, MUSIC, which is commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Fame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star binaries and their associated gravitational wave signal facilitate precision tests of General Relativity. Any deviation of the detected gravitational waveform from General Relativity would therefore be a smoking gun signature of new physics, in the form of additional forces, dark matter particles, or extra gravitational degrees of freedom. To be able to probe new theories, precise knowledge of the expected waveform is required. In our work, we consider a generic setup by augmenting General Relativity with an additional, massive scalar field. We then compute the inspiral dynamics of a binary system, for circular orbits, by employing an effective field theoretical approach, while giving a detailed introduction to the computational framework. Finally, we derive the modified TaylorF2 phase of the gravitational wave signal at next-to-leading order in the post-Newtonian expansion, and leading order in the parameters of the scalar sector, such as the scalar charge. As a consequence of our model-agnostic approach, our results are readily adaptable to a plethora of new physics scenarios, including modified gravity theories and scalar dark matter models.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic quasi-normal modes, generated at second order in black hole perturbation theory, are a promising target for testing gravity in the nonlinear regime with next-generation gravitational wave detectors. While their frequencies have long been known, their amplitudes remain poorly studied. We introduce regular variables and compute amplitudes for Schwarzschild black holes with the Leaver algorithm. We find a nonlinear ratio $\mathcal{R}\simeq0.154e^{-0.068i}$ for the most excited $\ell=4$ mode, matching results from Numerical Relativity. We also predict new low-frequency $\ell=2$ quadratic modes.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ghost Pilgrim Dark Energy Fractal Cosmology with Observational Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore dark energy models, mainly ghost, generalized ghost, and generalized ghost pilgrim dark energy models within the framework of fractal cosmology. To obtain solutions for the field equations, we employ a parameterization of the deceleration parameter as proposed by \textit{R.K. Tiwari}. By utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we impose constraints on the free parameters of the derived solutions. The analysis is based on observational datasets, including 57 data points from the Observational Hubble Data ($OHD$) and, 1048 points from the $Pantheon$ Supernovae sample. This approach allows us to assess the viability of the dark energy models in describing the current cosmic expansion. According to the effective equation-of-state parameter, the model maintains itself in the quintessence era and ultimately switches into the Einstein-de Sitter model. Furthermore, we investigate the statefinder, jerk, snap, and lerk parameters. The energy conditions of each model satisfy the weak and null energy conditions but violate the strong energy condition. We find that the $Om(z)$ curves for the data samples exhibit a consistently negative slope throughout the entire range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No-hair theorems are uniqueness results constraining the form of the metric of black holes in general relativity. These theorems are typically formulated under idealized assumptions, involving a mixture of local (regularity of the horizon) and global aspects (vacuum spacetime and asymptotic flatness). This limits their applicability to astrophysical scenarios of interest such as binary black holes and accreting systems, as well as their extension to horizonless objects. A previous result due to G\"urlebeck constrains the asymptotic multipolar structure of static spacetimes containing black holes surrounded by matter although not revealing the possible structure of the metric itself. In this work, we disentangle some of these assumptions in the static and axisymmetric case. Specifically: i) we show that only a one-parameter family of black-hole geometries is compatible with a given external gravitational field, ii) we also analyze the case in which the central object is close to forming an event horizon but is still horizonless and show that the deviations from the natural black-hole shape have to die off as one approaches the black hole limit under the physical principle that curvatures are bounded.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in curved space-time with torsion in the leading order of the $1/N$ expansion. The effective potential of the torsion sector is calculated using the new technique based on the nonlocal part of anomaly-induced action which was recently found to produce the effective potential in the low-energy limit. The spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the change of the torsion term is found, confirming the statements known from the existing literature. Furthermore, the gap equation is calculated as a function of curvature and torsion. Finally, the behavior of the effective four fermions coupling constant as a function of the torsion is discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Definition of the Spin Charge in Asymptotically-Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a solution to a classic problem in gravitational physics consisting of defining the spin associated with asymptotically-flat spacetimes. We advocate that the correct asymptotic symmetry algebra to approach this problem is the generalized-BMS algebra $\textsf{gbms}$ instead of the BMS algebra used hitherto in the literature for which a notion of spin is generically unavailable. We approach the problem of defining the spin charges from the perspective of coadjoint orbits of $\textsf{gbms}$ and construct the complete set of Casimir invariants that determine $\textsf{gbms}$ coadjoint orbits, using the notion of vorticity for $\textsf{gbms}$. This allows us to introduce spin charges for $\textsf{gbms}$ as the generators of area-preserving diffeomorphisms forming its isotropy subalgebra. To elucidate the parallelism between our analysis and the Poincar\'e case, we clarify several features of the Poincar\'e embedding in $\textsf{gbms}$ and reveal the presence of condensate fields associated with the symmetry breaking from $\textsf{gbms}$ to Poincar\'e. We also introduce the notion of a rest frame available only for this extended algebra. This allows us to construct, from the spin generator, the gravitational analog of the Pauli--Luba\'nski pseudo-vector. Finally, we obtain the $\textsf{gbms}$ moment map, which we use to construct the gravitational spin charges and gravitational Casimirs from their dual algebra counterparts.</description>

      <title>Quantumness of relic gravitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the relic gravitons are produced in entangled states of opposite (comoving) three-momenta, their distributions and their averaged multiplicities must determine the maximal frequency of the spectrum above which the created pairs are exponentially suppressed. The absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency derived in this manner coincides with the THz domain and does not rely on the details of the cosmological scenario. The THz limit also translates into a constraint of the order of $10^{-33}$ on the minimal chirp amplitudes that should be effectively reached by all classes of hypothetical detectors aiming at the direct scrutiny of a signal in the frequency domain that encompasses the MHz and the GHz bands. The obtained high-frequency limit is deeply rooted in the quantumness of the produced gravitons whose multiparticle final sates are macroscopic but always non-classical. Since the unitary evolution preserves their coherence, the quantumness of the gravitons can be associated with an entanglement entropy that is associated with the loss of the complete information on the underlying quantum field. It turns out that the reduction of the density matrix in different bases leads to the same Von Neumann entropy whose integral over all the modes of the spectrum is dominated by the maximal frequency. Thanks to the THz bound the total integrated entropy of the gravitons can be comparable with the cosmic microwave background entropy but not larger. Besides the well known cosmological implications, we then suggest that a potential detection of gravitons between the MHz and the THz may therefore represent a direct evidence of macroscopic quantum states associated with the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Ring of Deformed AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the wave optics is employed to investigate the Einstein ring of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole (BH). When the source is fixed on the AdS boundary, one can obtain the corresponding response function generated on the antipodal side of the boundary. By utilizing a virtual optical system equipped with a convex lens, we are able to capture an image of the BH's holographic Einstein ring on the screen. The influence of the relevant physical parameters and the observer's position on the characteristics of the Einstein ring is also investigated, revealing that variations in the observer's position result in a transition of the displayed image from an axisymmetric ring to an arc, ultimately converging into a solitary point of luminosity. In addition, variations in the relevant physical parameters naturally exert influences on the Einstein ring. The photon ring of the BH was also investigated from a geometric optics perspective, and the numerical results indicate that the incident angle of the photon ring aligns with that of the Einstein ring. In the context of modified gravity theories, the investigation of Einstein rings formed by deformed AdS-Schwarzschild BH is expected to not only contribute to advancing the development of gravitational theories but also facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of spacetime geometry and the physical properties of BHs, thereby distinguishing them from Schwarzschild BH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>The effect of quantum decoherence on inflationary gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of inflation provides a mechanism to explain the structures we observe today in the Universe, starting from quantum-mechanically generated fluctuations. However, this leaves the question of: how did the quantum-to-classical transition, occur? During inflation, tensor perturbations interact (at least gravitationally) with other fields, meaning that we need to view these perturbations as an open system that interacts with an environment. In this paper, the evolution of the system is described using a Lindblad equation, which describes the quantum decoherence of the system. This is a possible mechanism for explaining the quantum-to-classical transition. We show that this quantum decoherence leads to a scale-dependent increase of the gravitational wave power spectrum, depending on the strength and time dependence of the interaction between the system and the environment. By using current upper bounds on the gravitational wave power spectrum from inflation, obtained from CMB and the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA constraints, we find an upper bound on the interaction strength. Furthermore, we compute the decoherence criterion, which indicates the minimal interaction strength needed for a specific scale to have successfully decohered by the end of inflation. Assuming that the CMB modes have completely decohered, we indicate a lower bound on the interaction strength. In addition, this decoherence criterion allows us to look at which scales might not have fully decohered and could still show some relic quantum signatures. Lastly, we use sensitivity forecasts to study how future gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and ET, could constrain the decoherence parameter space. Due to the scale-dependence of the power spectrum, LISA could only have a very small impact. However, ET will be able to significantly improve our current constraints for specific decoherence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Critical reassessment of the restricted Weyl symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories have been proposed to be invariant under a larger class of transformations that take the form of local Weyl transformations supplemented by a restriction that the conformal factor satisfies a covariant Klein-Gordon equation. The action of these theories indeed seems to be invariant under such transformations up to boundary terms, this property being referred to as ``restricted Weyl symmetry''. However, we find that corresponding equations of motion are not invariant under these transformations. This is a paradox, that is explained by realizing that the restriction condition on the conformal factor forces the restricted Weyl transformation to be a nonlocal transformation. For nonlocal transformations would-be boundary terms cannot in general be discarded from the action. Moreover, variations of trajectories cannot be assumed to vanish at boundaries of the action when deriving equations of motion. We illustrate both of these less known properties by considering a series of simple examples. Finally, we apply these observations to the case of globally scale-invariant scalar-tensor theories to demonstrate that restricted Weyl transformations are, in fact, not symmetries of the full system.</description>

      <title>Are long gamma-ray bursts progenitors to merging binary black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of delay times between the formation of binary black hole (BBH) progenitors and their gravitational-wave (GW) merger provides important clues about their unknown formation histories. When inferring the delay time distribution, it is typically assumed that BBH progenitor formation traces the star formation rate (SFR). In this work, we consider the rate of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) instead of the SFR. LGRBs are thought to correspond to the formation of (possibly spinning) black holes, and may therefore be related to the BBH progenitor population. By comparing the redshift evolution of the LGRB rate as inferred by Ghirlanda &amp; Salvaterra (2022) and the BBH merger rate inferred by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observations, we find that the delay time distribution between LGRBs and BBH mergers is well-described by a power law with minimum delay time $10$ Myr and slope $\alpha ={-0.96}^{+0.64}_{-0.76}$ (90% credibility). This matches theoretical expectations for the BBH delay time distribution, which in turn lends support to the hypothesis that LGRBs trace BBH progenitor formation. However, comparing the absolute rates of these two populations, we find that at most $f = {4}^{+10}_{-2}\%$ of LGRBs may evolve into merging BBH. We also consider the possibility that LGRBs only produce BBH systems with large aligned spins (with effective inspiral spin $\chi_\mathrm{eff} &gt; 0.2$). In this case, we find $f = 0.3^{+1.0}_{-0.2}\%$ and the delay time distribution favors the steepest power-law slopes we consider ($\alpha = -2$). We argue that asynchronous observations of LGRBs and GWs provide a powerful multimessenger probe of black hole lifecycles across cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector from Horndeski theories and beyond: Mapping fields and fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Cosmology, when dissipative effects are minimal, the energy content of the Universe can be effectively described as a sum of perfect fluids. Perfect fluid descriptions ensure thermal equilibrium since they equilibrate immediately. However, interactions among different energy content of the Universe might prevent such rapid equilibration. This limitation calls for a more fundamental framework that incorporates these interactions directly at the level of the action. In earlier work, two of the authors demonstrated that an interacting dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) field theory action could be derived from a modified gravity action via a conformal transformation, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the field theory action and fluid for a unique interaction term [arXiv:2006.04618]. In this work, we extend that analysis by considering quadratic order Horndeski gravity, identifying two classes of models: field coupling and field-kinetic coupling. Our approach generalizes the coupling function for DE-DM interactions by incorporating an additional dependence on kinetic terms. We establish a field-to-fluid mapping for dark matter and find that this mapping only holds for a specific form of the interaction strength. Interestingly, we show that this interaction strength excludes non-gravitational interactions between dark energy and dark radiation. Numerical analysis reveals that purely kinetic interactions within the dark sector can significantly alter cosmological evolution compared to non-interacting scenarios, highlighting the strong dependence of cosmological dynamics on coupling strength. A preliminary examination of linear scalar perturbations indicates that the field-kinetic coupling results in a non-zero gravitational slip parameter and momentum exchange.</description>

      <title>Two-loop corrections in power spectrum in models of inflation with PBHs formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the two-loop corrections in primordial power spectrum in models of single field inflation incorporating an intermediate USR phase employed for PBHs formation. Among the total eleven one-particle irreducible Feynman diagrams, we calculate the corrections from the "double scoop" two-loop diagram involving two vertices of quartic Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the fractional two-loop correction in power spectrum scales like the square of the fractional one-loop correction. We confirm our previous findings that the loop corrections become arbitrarily large in the setup where the transition from the intermediate USR to the final slow-roll phase is very sharp. This suggests that in order for the analysis to be under perturbative control against loop corrections, one requires a mild transition with a long enough relaxation period towards the final attractor phase.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>String Theory in a Pinch: Resolving the Gregory-Laflamme Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin enough black strings are unstable to growing ripples along their length, eventually pinching and forming a naked singularity on the horizon. We investigate how string theory can resolve this singularity. First, we study the string-scale version of the static non-uniform black strings that branch off at the instability threshold: "string-ball strings", which are linearly extended, self-gravitating configurations of string balls obtained in the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) approach to near-Hagedorn string states. We construct non-uniform HP strings in spatial dimensions $d\leq 6$ and show that, as the inhomogeneity increases, they approach localized HP balls. We also examine the thermodynamic properties of the different phases in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles. We find that, for a sufficiently small mass, the uniform HP string will be stable and not evolve into a non-uniform or localized configuration. Building on these results and independent evidence from the evolution of the black string instability with $\alpha'$ corrections, we propose that, at least in $d=4,5$, string theory slows and eventually halts the pinching evolution at a classically stable stringy neck. In $d\geq 6$ this transition is likely to occur into a puffed-up string ball. The system then enters a slower phase in which the neck gradually evaporates into radiation. We discuss this scenario as a framework for understanding how string theory resolves the formation of naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Tensor global symmetries and the Stueckelberg mechanism for tensor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of tensor global symmetries, featuring conserved currents of mixed symmetry and higher spin Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We develop a Stueckelberg mechanism for mixed symmetry tensor fields at the linearized level, focusing on the massive graviton, the massive $(2,1)$ Curtright field and the massive $(2,2)$ field. Counting degrees of freedom, we identify the set of fields that necessarily appear in the gauge invariant Stueckelberg action in each case. These fields transform under shift symmetries and they are a vector and a scalar in the first case, a graviton, a Kalb-Ramond field and a vector in the second case and a Curtright field and a graviton in the third case. The analysis results in gauge invariant and fully conserved currents of mixed symmetry for the corresponding gauge theories, which are linked to their tensor global symmetries and they can be minimally coupled to suitable background fields. Viewing the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field as Nambu-Goldstone bosons for constant symmetric and antisymmetric shift symmetries, we use a nonminimal coupling to uncover a 't Hooft anomaly in linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Dark matter fraction derived from the M31 rotation curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of a spiral galaxy derived from its rotation curve must account for the galaxy's past accretion history. There are several lines of evidence indicating that M31 experienced a major merger 2 to 3 Gyr ago. Here, we have generated a dynamical model of M31 as a merger remnant that reproduces most of its properties, from the central bar to the outskirts. The model accounts for the past major merger, and reproduces the details of M31's rotation curve, including its 14 kpc bump and the observed increase of velocity beyond 25 kpc. Furthermore, we find non-equilibrium and oscillatory motions in the gas of the merger-remnant outskirts caused by material in a tidal tail returning to the merger remnant. A total dynamical M31 mass of 4.5 $\times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ within 137 kpc has been obtained after scaling it to the observed HI rotation curve. Within this radial distance, 68% of the total dynamical mass is dark.</description>
