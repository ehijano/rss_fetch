      <title>Demonstration and Non-volatile Trimming of a Highly-Parallel, High-Capacity Silicon Microdisk Transmitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical interconnects are the most promising solution to address the data-movement bottleneck in data centers. Silicon microdisks, benefiting from their compact footprint, low energy consumption, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) capability, have emerged as an attractive and scalable platform for optical modulation. However, microdisk resonators inherently exhibit low fabrication error tolerance, limiting their practical deployment. Here, utilizing a CMOS photonics platform, we demonstrate 1.2 Tb/s of off-die bandwidth through a 64 microdisk modulator system. In addition, we develop an automated, close-looped, non-reversible, low-loss, and picometer-precision permanent wavelength tuning technique using laser trimming. The trimming technique reduces 33 % of the energy consumption needed to thermally tune the microdisk resonant wavelength. Using this technique, we achieve a fully passive, 5-channel dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM, 50 GHz spacing) transmitter. The integration of the high speed (1.2 Tb/s), low energy consumption (29 fJ/bit) and the permanent wavelength trimming lays a robust foundation for next-generation optical interconnect systems, poised to facilitate scaling of future AI and computing hardware.</description>

      <title>Tilted Material in an Optical Cavity: Light-Matter Moir\'e Effect and Coherent Frequency Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons formed inside optical cavities offer a highly tunable platform for exploring novel quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce and theoretically characterize a light-matter moir\'e effect (LMME) that arises when a 2D material is tilted inside a planar optical cavity, in contrast to stacking multiple layers at a twist angle as is done in forming 2D moir\'e hetero-structures. We show that this geometric tilt produces emergent periodicity in the light-matter coupling, yielding displaced replicas of the polariton dispersion and flat bands near the Brillouin-zone center. Through time-dependent quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that LMME enables coherent frequency conversion and remains robust against phonon-induced decoherence. Our findings establish LMME as a new platform for engineering polariton band structures, the generation of flat bands and performing coherent frequency conversion relevant for developing polariton-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Analytical models for coated plasmonic particles: effects of shape and size-corrected dielectric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, modal expansion methods (MEMs) were developed to accurately predict the extinction and scattering spectra of bare and coated plasmonic particles. However, it remains uncertain whether the accuracy of analytical models is preserved when incorporating size-corrected dielectric functions. We compare numerical (COMSOL) and analytical extinction and scattering spectra for various particle shapes - rods, disks, prisms, bicones, and bipyramids - using both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. Size correction primarily causes broadening and a reduction in the plasmonic peaks. Still, the accuracy of analytical models is maintained for all shapes except sharp bicones, where MEM fails for both bulk and size-corrected dielectric functions. This failure arises from the strong localization of the plasmonic field near the sharp bicone tips. However, for realistic bicone models with nanometer-scale tip curvature, MEM performs well.</description>

      <title>In situ calibration of camera-refraction interface based on analytical refractive imaging equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential process in photogrammetry, serving as a crucial link between the 2D image coordinate system and the 3D world coordinate system. However, when observations are conducted through refractive interfaces, the refraction effects at these interfaces render traditional calibration methods ineffective, significantly compromising measurement accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel camera calibration method based on the analytical refractive imaging (ARI) equation. The ARI method facilitates accurate estimation of camera parameters from distorted images and enables in-situ joint calibration of both the camera and the refractive interface. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method reduces the error to only 10% of that produced by conventional ray-tracing (RT) method. Moreover, while maintaining comparable computational accuracy and efficiency, it effectively mitigates the local convergence issues that may arise in the polynomial fitting (PF) approach. Finally, reconstruction experiments further confirm the accuracy of the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing refractive calibration techniques in terms of accuracy while maintaining high precision in 3D reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Apparent Resonance Splitting in Self-Coupled Excitonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin films of high-refractive-index excitonic materials enable self-coupling by simultaneously supporting intrinsic excitonic transitions and optical resonances. These optical resonances take the form of Fabry-Perot resonances in thick films and absorption resonances in ultrathin films placed on metallic substrates. Here, we investigate whether these optical resonances lead to true exciton-photon hybridization. Using far-field reflectance and spectrally resolved photocurrent measurements, we study tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) flakes on both metallic and dielectric substrates across a range of thicknesses. While reflectance spectra for ultrathin flakes exhibit resonance splitting between excitons and absorption resonances, our photocurrent measurements reveal only excitonic peaks, indicating that no polaritons are formed. In contrast, thicker flakes exhibit Fabry-Perot resonances that strongly couple to excitons, resulting in clear splitting in both reflectance and photocurrent spectra, and providing evidence of polariton formation. We further show that the polariton resonances can be tuned through the reflection phase at the WS$_2$-substrate interface by changing the substrate material. In addition to coupling with the strong A-exciton, we observe polariton formation involving the weaker B-exciton at shorter wavelengths, as well as higher-order hybridization where both excitons interact simultaneously with a single Fabry-Perot resonance. These findings clarify the distinction between apparent and true strong coupling in excitonic materials and demonstrate how reflection phase and flake thickness can be used to engineer light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Thermography Equation: From Conceptual Relation to Quantitative Formulation via the Optogeometric Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a methodological transition from the conceptually formulated thermographic measurement equation (the so called thermography equation) to its quantitative form, expressed through the optogeometric factor. This factor directly links the known radiant flux from the measured surface to the energy captured by a single pixel of a thermal camera. The formulation is based on geometric optical relations between the scene and the detector and is applicable to both scene-based and sensor-based approaches. The resulting expression provides a general framework for quantitative thermography.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of thermal radiation from biperiodic layered systems using the T-matrix method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are becoming important tools for the control of thermal radiation. Understanding their functional possibilities on computational grounds requires evaluating the response of the biperiodic layered system for many degrees of freedom, including several radiation directions and polarisations, while varying lattice spacing, thicknesses, and/or materials of homogeneous layers, over a range of frequencies. The diverse set of cases that need to be considered in simulations prompts for efficient numerical tools to handle them. To respond to this need, we present a method for computing the thermal radiation from metasurfaces that combines the directional Kirchhoff law with efficient T-matrix based calculations. We show that such a method can accurately reproduce experimental data from a metasurface made of platinum square plates. Additionally, we predict highly circularly polarised emissivity from a chiral metasurface. When comparing CPU-times, the method outperforms other approaches such as rigorous coupled wave analysis already at the modest number of 61 cases per frequency.</description>

      <title>Tunable optical emissions of Eu3+ ions enabled by pressure-driven phase transition in ZnO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the optical properties of rare-earth ions in wide-bandgap semiconductors remains a major challenge in the development of next-generation photonic materials. Here, we show that external hydrostatic pressure modulates the structural characteristics of ZnO thin films and, in turn, tunes the optical emission behavior of embedded Eu3+ ions. By combining in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy under high-pressure conditions with first-principles calculations, we capture a pressure-induced phase transition from the hexagonal wurtzite to the cubic rocksalt structure near 10 GPa. This transformation is accompanied by complete quenching of the D0 - FJ Europium emissions near the transition threshold, followed by a partial recovery at higher pressures, likely associated with the emergence of structural disorder. Concurrently, the Stark components of the emission bands exhibit a redshift and significant broadening with increasing pressure, reflecting enhanced crystal field strength as interatomic distances decrease. Additional first-principles calculations support the observed pressure-induced shifts in the Eu-4f states and emphasize the influence of lattice symmetry on their electronic environment. These results show that hydrostatic pressure is an effective way to adjust the optical emissions of rare-earth ions by changing their symmetry and local environment, providing a basis for designing photonic devices and luminescent materials controlled by pressure.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Klein-Gordon field theory in $(D+1)$ dimensions in the presence of a $(D-1)$-dimensional hyperplanar $\delta$-like potential that couples quadratically to the field derivatives. This model effectively generalizes the Neumann boundary condition for the scalar field on the plane, as it reduces to this condition in an appropriate limit of the coupling parameter. Specifically, we calculate the modifications to the Feynman propagator induced by the planar potential and analyze the interaction energy between a stationary point-like source and the potential, obtaining a general and exact expression. We demonstrate that, under certain conditions relating the field mass and the coupling constant to the external potential, the vacuum state becomes unstable, giving rise to a pair-creation phenomenon that resembles the Schwinger effect in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Control of Thermal Emission from Photonic Crystals with Two-Level Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal light engineering is a field of considerable interest and potential. We study quantum light-matter interactions in a one-dimensional photonic crystal with two-level atoms as the active medium, replacing classical oscillators in traditional blackbody models. In a thermal bath with pumping, these atoms modulate thermal emission via interactions with photonic modes. The model with quantum two-level systems enables the processes of spontaneous emission, stimulated absorption, and stimulated emission. Equilibrium and nonequilibrium regimes depend on competition between pumping and thermal relaxation rates. Strong light-matter interaction and photon decay govern dynamics and steady states. In equilibrium, with a high thermal relaxation rate, photon numbers are initially determined by spontaneous emission and later stabilize due to stimulated absorption, influenced by light-matter interaction strength. In-band-gap photons reach steady states at a time scale of one or two orders of magnitude longer than outside-band-gap photons. Interestingly, for a strong light-matter interaction, all photons in the equilibrium regimes show Planckian radiation, regardless of their frequencies in or out of the band gaps. Band-gap suppression of thermal emission is more pronounced with weaker light-matter interaction or larger photon decay. In the nonequilibrium regime, the dynamics of photon numbers exhibit a multi-time-scale process transitioning to steady states due to strong pumping and stimulated processes. Steady-state electron populations of two-level atoms deviate from the Fermi-Dirac distribution, and the steady-state photon numbers exhibit super-Planckian emission. These findings enable quantum control of thermal emission spectra, which is relevant for reducing thermal noise in quantum computing or enhancing radiative cooling.</description>

      <title>The DeepFMKit Python package: A toolbox for simulating and analyzing deep frequency modulation interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Frequency Modulation Interferometry (DFMI) is an emerging laser interferometry technique for high-precision metrology, offering picometer-level displacement measurements and the potential for absolute length determination with sub-wavelength accuracy. However, the design and optimization of DFMI systems involve a complex interplay between interferometer physics, laser technology, multiple noise sources, and the choice of data processing algorithm. To address this, we present DeepFMKit, a new open-source Python library for the end-to-end simulation and analysis of DFMI systems. The framework features a high-fidelity physics engine that rigorously models key physical effects such as time-of-flight delays in dynamic interferometers, arbitrary laser modulation waveforms, and colored noise from user-defined $1/f^\alpha$ spectral densities. This engine is coupled with a suite of interchangeable parameter estimation algorithms, including a highly-optimized, parallelized frequency-domain Non-linear Least Squares (NLS) for high-throughput offline analysis, and multiple time-domain Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) implementations for real-time state tracking, featuring both random walk and integrated random walk (constant velocity) process models. Furthermore, DeepFMKit includes a high-throughput experimentation framework for automating large-scale parameter sweeps and Monte Carlo analyses, enabling systematic characterization of system performance. DeepFMKit's modular, object-oriented architecture facilitates the rapid configuration of virtual experiments, providing a powerful computational tool for researchers to prototype designs, investigate systematic errors, and accelerate the development of precision interferometry.</description>

      <title>Sunlight-Excited Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion for Quantum Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging, which harnesses quantum correlations to achieve imaging with multiple advantages over classical optics, has been in development for several years. Here, we explore sunlight, serving as the pump beam, to excite spontaneous parametric down-conversion to get the quantum correlation of two photons. Remarkably, our investigations disclose that the photon pairs produced from sunlight are well correlated in position such that they can be used for quantum imaging. Consequently, this demonstrates a latent application scenario in which the incoherent beam is harnessed as the pump source for quantum imaging. Our research is of substantial significance as it broadens the scope of available illumination options, such as using scattering light or non-traditional artificial incoherent light sources, for quantum information, a prime potential application being a space-based quantum information mechanism where this approach allows the system to operate independently of a laser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry dictates the physical properties of materials. The symmetry of the Bravais lattice defines the set of points, lines, and planes over which sets of planewaves are degenerate, upon which atomic symmetry determines the interaction potentials which may lift such degeneracies. This results in wavefunctions which are single planewaves throughout the BZ, except in the vicinity of the removed degeneracies. As optical transitions between any two planewaves are forbidden, only regions of the Brillouin zone (BZ) near these lifted degeneracies contribute to optical properties. Application to optical response of Si and other semiconductors reveals that a single band transition, with only two planewaves, well describes their dielectric properties. Further, it provides a framework to understand non-linear optical response which is demonstrated to arise from higher order degeneracy existing along high symmetry lines/points of the BZ.</description>

Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies have become pivotal in the implementation of communication, imaging and computing modalities. Among these applications, quantum ghost imaging (GI) exploits photon correlations to surpass classical limits, with recent advances in spatial-mode encoding and phase imaging. In parallel, all-optical computing offers powerful, passive-light processing capabilities. Here, we explore the intersection of these domains, revealing a conceptual and operational link between GI and Grover's quantum search algorithm (GSA) which is designed to search for elements in an unstructured database. Here, the elements are encoded as phases in the position basis states of photons. To show this, we use entangled photon pairs, with one photon encoding the oracle features while the other photon is used to find the marked element.</description>

      <title>Wavelength dependence of laser pulse filamentation around atomic resonances</title>

Abstract: We investigate the propagation and nonlinear self-focusing of TW power laser pulses that create 10-m-scale, highly homogeneous plasma channels in rubidium vapor. Using computational solutions of the relevant propagation equations, we study the effects of the ionizing pulse central wavelength in relation to the resonance frequencies of atomic rubidium. Recent experiments show that pulse propagation and plasma channel creation is distinctly different for 780 nm laser pulses (resonant with the rubidium $D_2$ line) and 810 nm laser pulses. We study pulse propagation in a $\pm$30 nm range around the $D_2$ resonance and find that the results are distinctly different when tuning to sub-resonant wavelengths from those obtained for super-resonant wavelengths. For pulse wavelengths below the resonance the behavior is similar to the resonant case, characterized by strong self-focusing and a sharp plasma boundary. Pulse wavelengths above 780 nm on the other hand yield gradually weaker self-focusing and an increasingly diffuse plasma boundary. Our results suggest that the observed behavior can be attributed to an interplay between multiple factors: anomalous dispersion around atomic resonances, resonant transitions between excited states of Rb lying in the 740-780 nm range and wavelength-dependent multiphoton ionization rates.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally deficient topological square-root insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most surprising features of effectively non-Hermitian physical systems is their potential to exhibit a striking nonlinear response and fragility to small perturbations. This feature arises from spectral singularities known as exceptional points, whose realization in the spectrum typically requires fine-tuning of parameters. The design of such systems receives significant impetus from the recent conception of \emph{exceptional deficiency}, in which the entire energy spectrum is composed of exceptional points. Here, we present a concrete and transparent mechanism that enforces exceptional deficiency through lattice sum rules in non-Hermitian topological square-root insulators. We identify the resulting dynamical signatures in static broadband amplification and non-Abelian adiabatic state amplification, differentiate between bulk and boundary effects, and outline routes to implementation in physical platforms</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a portable polarimeter capable of real-time visualization of partial and fully polarized light over a broad band of wavelengths. Our system utilizes a Raspberry Pi computer with a low-cost data acquisition "HAT" (DAQ HAT) and an integrated photodetection circuit. Wide bandwidth operation is achieved through digital calibration of an arbitrary retardance waveplate presented herein. All mechanical, electrical, and software components are open source and available on a GitHub repository. This completely integrated approach provides an efficient tool for modern optics research laboratories and is well-suited for educational demonstrations.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{T}$-matrix method for computation of second-harmonic generation upon optical wave scattering from clusters of arbitrary particles: Application to nonlinear optical interaction of bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the $\mathcal{T}$-matrix formalism tailored for numerical analysis of second-harmonic (SH) generation from arbitrarily shaped particles made of centrosymmetric optical materials. First, the transfer matrix of a single particle is computed via the extended boundary condition method, in which the electromagnetic fields both at fundamental frequency and SH are expanded in vector spherical wave functions, and the integral formulation is satisfied away from the surface of the scatterer. We allow for the accurate physical description of the SH sources by taking into account both local surface and nonlocal bulk polarization contributions to the nonlinear polarization density source responsible for the generation of the SH signal by a particle. This single-particle formalism is then extended to arbitrary distributions of particles by incorporating into the formalism linear and nonlinear electromagnetic wave scattering from the particles in the cluster. Importantly from a practical point of view, our method can be applied to particles of arbitrary shape made of optical materials characterized by general frequency-dispersion relations, so that it can describe the linear and nonlinear optical response of clusters of metallic, semiconductor, or polaritonic particles, as well as mixtures of such particles. The approach proposed here is faster and more memory-efficient than well-established numerical techniques, especially in the analysis of spheroidal particles, due to the favorable symmetries of spherical wave basis functions used in the wave scattering analysis.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Light-Driven Nonlinear Optical Extreme Learner via Data Reverberation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks have revolutionized fields from computer vision to natural language processing, yet their growing energy and computational demands threaten future progress. Optical neural networks promise greater speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency, but suffer from weak optical nonlinearities. Here, we demonstrate a low-power, incoherent-light-driven optical extreme learner that leverages 'data nonlinearity' from optical pattern reverberation, eliminating reliance on intrinsic nonlinear materials. By encoding input data in the spatial polarization distribution of a tailored optical cavity and allowing light to pass through it multiple times, we achieve nonlinear transformations at extremely low optical power. Coupled with a simple trainable readout, our optical learner consistently outperforms linear digital networks in standard image classification tasks and XOR benchmarks, delivering accuracy matching fully nonlinear digital models. Our compact, energy-efficient approach significantly reduces complexity, cost, and energy consumption, paving the way for practical, scalable all-optical machine learning platforms.</description>

      <title>Optically-biased Rydberg microwave receiver enabled by hybrid nonlinear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling of Rydberg vapour medium to both microwave and optical fields allows harnessing the merits of all-optical detection, e.g. weak disruption of the measured field and invulnerability to extremely strong fields, owing to the lack of a conventional antenna in the detector. However, the highest sensitivity in this approach is typically achieved by introducing an additional microwave field acting as a local oscillator, thereby compromising the all-optical nature of the measurement. Here we propose an alternative method, optical-bias detection, that allows truly all-optical operation, while retaining exceptional sensitivity. We tackle the issue of laser phase noise, emerging in this type of detection, via a simultaneous measurement of the laser phase noise in a nonlinear process and real-time data processing, which overall yields an improvement of $35\ \mathrm{dB}$ in terms of signal-to-noise ratio compared with the basic approach. We report the sensitivity of $176\ \mathrm{nV/cm/\sqrt{Hz}}$ and reliable operation up to $3.5\ \mathrm{mV/cm}$ of $13.9\ \mathrm{GHz}$ electric field. We also demonstrate a quadrature-amplitude modulated data transmission, underlining the capability of the system to detect quadratures of the microwave field. This approach is thus directly comparable to the state-of-the-art superheterodyne, while retaining the merits of all-optical detection.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Beyond reviewing necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect, we discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, stemming from the spectral topology, and show how skin states can be distinguished from topological boundary states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in one-dimensional non-interacting systems, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in many-body systems are highlighted. Lastly, experimental signatures and applications are discussed, and an outlook is provided.</description>

      <title>Scattering graph method for 3D radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel method for monochromatic scalar 3D radiative transfer, designed primarily for modeling remote sensing imaging, is presented. For simulating an observation of an imaging satellite instrument, the method uses a heuristic scattering coupling function to model the inter-pixel scattering of radiation, which is represented with a graph. The GPU-capable code implementation of the method, TURSCA, was validated against two established 3D RT models, Siro and SHDOM with relative agreement at 3% and 6%, respectively. The capabilities of TURSCA in modeling a satellite observation of an emission plume are examined. The presented method opens up new avenues of research, especially in satellite-based remote sensing of atmospheres.</description>
