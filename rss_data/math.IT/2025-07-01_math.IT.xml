      <title>Communication via Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative take on the recently popularized concept of `$\textit{joint sensing and communications}$', which focuses on using communication resources also for sensing. Here, we propose the opposite, where we exploit the sensing capabilities of the receiver for communication. Our goal is to characterize the fundamental limits of communication over such a channel, which we call `$\textit{communication via sensing}$'. We assume that changes in the sensed attributes, e.g., location, speed, etc., are limited due to practical constraints, which are captured by assuming a finite-state channel (FSC) with an input cost constraint. We first formulate an upper bound on the $N$-letter capacity as a cost-constrained optimization problem over the input sequence distribution, and then convert it to an equivalent problem over the state sequence distribution. Moreover, by breaking a walk on the underlying Markov chain into a weighted sum of traversed graph cycles in the long walk limit, we obtain a compact single-letter formulation of the capacity upper bound. Finally, for a specific case of a two-state FSC with noisy sensing characterized by a binary symmetric channel (BSC), we obtain a closed-form expression for the capacity upper bound. Comparison with an existing numerical lower bound shows that our proposed upper bound is very tight for all crossover probabilities.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Enhancing Multi-Target Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) has emerged as a transformative technology to enhance wireless sensing by dynamically morphing its three-dimensional (3D) surface shape and electromagnetic response. Unlike conventional rigid arrays, an FIM consists of low-cost radiating elements that can independently adjust their positions and radiation characteristics, thereby allowing for real-time optimization of the sensing environment. This paper investigates the impact of FIM on wireless sensing performance. Specifically, we focus on the maximization of the cumulated power of the probing signals at the target locations under the per-antenna power constraint by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the surface shape of the transmitting FIM. We propose a block coordinate descend (BCD) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution, by alternatively updating the FIM surface shape and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other one fixed at each step. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that FIM enhances wireless sensing by providing a new design degree-of-freedom to coordinate the correlation between steering vectors at different angles. Numerical results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves wireless sensing performance under the considered multi-target scenario.</description>

      <title>Linear Complementary Pairs of Algebraic Geometry Codes via Kummer Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their widespread applications, linear complementary pairs (LCPs) have attracted much attention in recent years. In this paper, we determine explicit construction of non-special divisors of degree $g$ and $g-1$ on Kummer extensions with specific properties. In addition, we present several methods for constructing LCPs of algebraic geometry codes (AG Codes) via Kummer extensions. These results are applied in constructing explicit LCPs of AG Codes from subcovers of the BM curve, elliptic function fields, hyperelliptic function fields and other function fields. It is important to mention that we construct several families LCPs of MDS AG Codes from elliptic function fields and we obtain some linear complementary dual (LCD) codes from certain maximal elliptic function fields and hyperelliptic function fields.</description>

      <title>General Mathematical Proof of Occam's Razor; Upgrading Theoretical Physicists' Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper's first aim is to prove a modernized Occam's razor beyond a reasonable doubt. To summarize the main argument in one sentence: If we consider all possible, intelligible, scientific models of ever-higher complexity, democratically, the predictions most favored by these complex models will agree with the predictions of the simplest models. This fact can be proven mathematically, thereby validating Occam's razor. Major parts of this line of reasoning have long preexisted within the depths of the algorithmic information theory literature, but they have always left room for doubts of various kinds. Therefore, we increase the generality, completeness, clarity, accessibility, and credibility of these arguments by countering over a dozen objections. We build our mathematical proof of Occam's razor on the shoulders of the exact 'chain rule' for Kolmogorov complexity.
  Concerning physics, we then go on to diagnose the primary amendable root cause of the present stagnation of the research field of fundamental theoretical physics. We show that the effective antidote would consist in a practically feasible upgrade to the theoretical physicists' research methodology: When proposing new theoretical models, physicists should simply calculate and report the total amount of information that their models consist of. We explain why this methodology would be highly effective as well as how these calculations could be performed efficiently.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Character Sums From Vectorial Dual-Bent Functions and Asymptotically Optimal Complex Codebooks With Small Alphabet Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid character sums are an important class of exponential sums which have nice applications in coding theory and sequence design. Let $\gf_{p^m}$ be the finite field with $p^m$ elements for a prime $p$ and a positive integer $m$. Let $V_n^{(p)}$ be an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\gf_p$ for a prime $p$. In this paper, we study the hybrid character sums of the form \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{x \in V_n^{(p)}}\psi\left(F(x)\right)\chi_1\left(a x\right), \end{eqnarray*} where $F$ is a function from $V_n^{(p)}$ to $\gf_{p^m}$ and $a \in V_n^{(p)}$, $\psi$ is a nontrivial multiplicative character of $\gf_{p^m}$ and $\chi_1$ is the canonical additive character of $V_n^{(p)}$. If $F(x)$ is a vectorial dual-bent function and $a \in V_n^{(p)}\setminus \{0\}$, we determine their complex modulus or explicit values under certain conditions, which generalizes some known results as special cases. It is concluded that the hybrid character sums from vectorial dual-bent functions have very small complex modulus. As applications, three families of asymptotically optimal complex codebooks are constructed from vectorial dual-bent functions and their maximal cross-correlation amplitude are determined based on the hybrid character sums. The constructed codebooks have very small alphabet sizes, which enhances their appeal for implementation. Besides, all of the three families of codebooks have only two-valued or three-valued cross-correlation amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Parallax QAMA: Novel Downlink Multiple Access for MISO Systems with Simple Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel downlink multiple access system with a multi-antenna transmitter and two single-antenna receivers, inspired by the underlying principles of hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (H-QAM) based multiple access (QAMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). In the proposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared symbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint symbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the transmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray mapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition to avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently demodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based on closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that of orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other competing alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We carry out system optimization and determine the achievable rate region. Numerical results show that the proposed system has a larger rate region relative to other benchmark schemes with receivers not using SIC, and even achieves a comparable rate region to those benchmark schemes with SIC receivers.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Secure Aggregation for Wireless Federated Learning with Multiple Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transmission latency of the secure aggregation problem in a \emph{wireless} federated learning system with multiple curious servers. We propose a privacy-preserving coded aggregation scheme where the servers can not infer any information about the distributed users' local gradients, nor the aggregation value. In our scheme, each user encodes its local gradient into $\sK$ confidential messages intended exclusively for different servers using a multi-secret sharing method, and each server forwards the summation of the received confidential messages, while the users sequentially employ artificial noise alignment techniques to facilitate secure transmission. Through these summations, the user can recover the aggregation of all local gradients. We prove the privacy guarantee in the information-theoretic sense and characterize the uplink and downlink communication latency measured by \emph{normalized delivery time} (NDT), both of which decrease monotonically with the number of servers $\sK$ while increasing over most of the range of the number of users $\sM$. Finally, we establish a lower bound on the NDT of the considered system and theoretically prove that the scheme achieves the optimal uplink and downlink NDT under the conditions $\sK \gg \sM \gg 0$ and $\sK \gg \sM$, respectively. For arbitrary $\sK$ and $\sM$, the proposed scheme achieves the optimal uplink NDT within a multiplicative gap of $4$.</description>

      <title>ISI-Aware Code Design: A Linear Approach Towards Reliable Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersymbol Interference (ISI) is a major bottleneck in Molecular Communication via Diffusion (MCvD), degrading system performance. This paper introduces two families of linear channel codes to mitigate ISI: Zero Pad Zero Start (ZPZS) and Zero Pad (ZP) codes, ensuring that each codeword avoids consecutive bit-1s. The ZPZS and ZP codes are then combined to form a binary ZP code, offering a higher code rate than linear ZP codes and allowing simple decoding via the Majority Location Rule (MLR). Additionally, a Leading One Zero Pad (LOZP) code is proposed, which relaxes zero-padding constraints by prioritizing the placement of bit-1s, achieving a higher rate than ZP. A closed-form expression is derived to compute expected ISI, showing it depends on the average bit-1 density in the codewords. ISI and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance are evaluated under two MCvD channel models: (i) without refresh, where past bits persist longer, and (ii) with refresh, where the channel is cleared after each reception. Results show that the LOZP code performs better in the refresh channel due to initial bit-1 placement, while ZP excels without refresh by reducing average bit-1 density. The asymptotic upper bound on code rate illustrates a trade-off between ISI and rate. Simulations demonstrate that ZP and LOZP codes improve BER by controlling bit-1 positions and density, providing better reliability in ISI-dominated regimes compared to conventional error-correcting codes.</description>

      <title>Bridging Physical and Digital Worlds: Embodied Large AI for Future Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence (AI) models offer revolutionary potential for future wireless systems, promising unprecedented capabilities in network optimization and performance. However, current paradigms largely overlook crucial physical interactions. This oversight means they primarily rely on offline datasets, leading to difficulties in handling real-time wireless dynamics and non-stationary environments. Furthermore, these models often lack the capability for active environmental probing. This paper proposes a fundamental paradigm shift towards wireless embodied large AI (WELAI), moving from passive observation to active embodiment. We first identify key challenges faced by existing models, then we explore the design principles and system structure of WELAI. Besides, we outline prospective applications in next-generation wireless. Finally, through an illustrative case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of WELAI and point out promising research directions for realizing adaptive, robust, and autonomous wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Multi-Access Coded Caching with Private Caches under Intersecting Index Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the coded caching system where each user, equipped with a private cache, accesses a distinct r-subset of access caches. A central server housing a library of files populates both private and access caches using uncoded placement. In this work, we focus on a constrained indexing regime, referred to as the intersection class, in which the sets used to index the demands of each user must have a nonempty intersection. This regime models resource-limited IoT scenarios such as edge-assisted IoT systems, where devices with small private caches connect to a small number of shared caches. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which the system parameters fall within this intersection class. Under this condition, we propose a centralized coded caching scheme and characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Next, we define a uniform-intersection subclass and establish a condition under which the system belongs to this subclass. Within this subclass, the proposed scheme has a regular structure, with each transmission benefiting the same number of users, and we characterize its rate-memory trade-off. Additionally, we derive an index coding-based lower bound on the minimum achievable worst-case rate under uncoded placement. Finally, we provide numerical comparisons between the rate of the proposed scheme, the new lower bound, and bounds from the original work.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning-Based Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design for RIS-Assisted MISO-OFDMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient for MIMO-AFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-assisted multicarrier waveform for future high mobility communications. A significant challenge in MIMO-AFDM systems is the multi-user interference (MUI), which can be effectively addressed by employing precoding techniques. However, the complexity introduced by AFDM makes the precoding process computationally expensive and challenging. To overcome this issue, We combine AFDM channel sparse property and using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method to iteratively process the precoding, thereby reducing the complexity of the precoding design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sparsification approach, coupled with the PCG method, achieving quite precoding performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. This makes the application of AFDM more feasible and efficient for high-mobility communication scenarios, paving the way for its broader implementation in next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of Cellular Automata on Spaces of Bernoulli Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework for modeling global spatio-temporal dynamics with local interactions. While CCAs have been applied across numerous scientific fields, identifying the local rule that governs observed dynamics remains a challenging task. Moreover, the underlying assumption of deterministic cell states often limits the applicability of CCAs to systems characterized by inherent uncertainty. This study, therefore, focuses on the identification of Cellular Automata on spaces of probability measures (CAMs), where cell states are represented by probability distributions. This framework enables the modeling of systems with probabilistic uncertainty and spatially varying dynamics. Moreover, we formulate the local rule identification problem as a parameter estimation problem and propose a meta-heuristic search based on Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) to estimate local rule parameters accurately from the observed data. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through local rule identification in two-dimensional CAMs with varying neighborhood types and radii.</description>

      <title>Limited Feedback in RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications: Use Cases, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential to unlock the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communication systems. Since massive RIS elements are typically implemented without baseband signal processing capabilities, limited CSI feedback is necessary when designing the reflection/refraction coefficients of the RIS. In this article, the unique RIS-assisted channel features, such as the RIS position-dependent channel fluctuation, the ultra-high dimensional sub-channel matrix, and the structured sparsity, are distilled from recent advances in limited feedback and used as guidelines for designing feedback schemes. We begin by illustrating the use cases and the corresponding challenges associated with RIS feedback. We then discuss how to leverage techniques such as channel customization, structured-sparsity, autoencoders, and others to reduce feedback overhead and complexity when devising feedback schemes. Finally, we identify potential research directions by considering the unresolved challenges, the new RIS architecture, and the integration with multi-modal information and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>On Universality of Non-Separable Approximate Message Passing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field characterizations of first-order iterative algorithms -- including Approximate Message Passing (AMP), stochastic and proximal gradient descent, and Langevin diffusions -- have enabled a precise understanding of learning dynamics in many statistical applications. For algorithms whose non-linearities have a coordinate-separable form, it is known that such characterizations enjoy a degree of universality with respect to the underlying data distribution. However, mean-field characterizations of non-separable algorithm dynamics have largely remained restricted to i.i.d. Gaussian or rotationally-invariant data.
  In this work, we initiate a study of universality for non-separable AMP algorithms. We identify a general condition for AMP with polynomial non-linearities, in terms of a Bounded Composition Property (BCP) for their representing tensors, to admit a state evolution that holds universally for matrices with non-Gaussian entries. We then formalize a condition of BCP-approximability for Lipschitz AMP algorithms to enjoy a similar universal guarantee. We demonstrate that many common classes of non-separable non-linearities are BCP-approximable, including local denoisers, spectral denoisers for generic signals, and compositions of separable functions with generic linear maps, implying the universality of state evolution for AMP algorithms employing these non-linearities.</description>

      <title>Zak-OFDM: Low Complexity Joint Equalization of OFDM Carriers in Doubly-Spread Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We communicate over wireless channels by first estimating and then equalizing the effective channel. In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes channel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral efficiency since it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are mutually unbiased. However, the naive approach to equalization has complexity ${\mathcal O}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$ and $N$ are respectively the number of delay and Doppler bins in an OTFS frame. We simplify equalization by transforming Zak-OTFS information symbols to CP-OFDM (cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation.
  Why not simply communicate with CP-OFDM? Inter-carrier interference (ICI) in CP-OFDM makes it is very challenging to acquire the complete frequency domain (FD) channel response between subcarriers in the presence of mobility and delay spread. We avoid this difficulty by estimating the effective channel in the DD domain from which we are able to reconstruct the complete FD channel response. We take advantage of CP-OFDM to design an ${\mathcal O}(M^2N^2)$ low-complexity method of jointly equalizing all subcarriers, where $MN$ is the number of subcarriers. Our approach removes the need for traditional pilots in CP-OFDM and reduces the need to vary carrier spacing with mobility.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Algorithm for Estimating Fidelity to a Pure State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimal quantum algorithm for fidelity estimation between two quantum states when one of them is pure. In particular, the (square root) fidelity of a mixed state to a pure state can be estimated to within additive error $\varepsilon$ by using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their state-preparation circuits, achieving a quadratic speedup over the folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. Our approach is technically simple, and can moreover estimate the quantity $\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(\rho\sigma^2)}$ that is not common in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first query-optimal approach to fidelity estimation involving mixed states.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems with In-Waveguide Attenuation: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna architecture for next-generation wireless networks, enabling enhanced adaptability and user-centric connectivity through antenna repositioning along waveguides. However, existing studies often overlook in-waveguide signal attenuation and in the literature, there is no comprehensive analysis on whether and under what conditions such an assumption is justified. This paper addresses this gap by explicitly incorporating in-waveguide attenuation into both the system model and algorithm design, and studying its impact on the downlink user data rates. We begin with a single-user scenario and derive a closed-form expression for the globally optimal antenna placement, which reveals how the attenuation coefficient and the user-to-waveguide distance jointly affect the optimal antenna position. Based on this analytical solution, we further provide a theoretical analysis identifying the system conditions under which the in-waveguide attenuation has an insignificant impact on the user achievable rate. The study is then extended to the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output setting, where two efficient algorithms are developed, based on the weighted minimum mean square error method and the maximum ratio combining method, to jointly optimize beamforming and antenna placement. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems substantially outperform conventional fixed-antenna baselines, underscoring their potential for future flexible wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Construction of 2-D Z-Complementary Array Code Sets with Flexible Lengths for Different System Requirements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.00970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new and optimal construction of two-dimensional (2-D) Z-complementary array code set (ZCACS) using multivariable extended Boolean functions (EBFs). The proposed 2-D arrays can be used in multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) systems. The proposed construction produces a better PMEPR upper bound than the existing constructions for such use cases. We also propose a tighter upper bound for the set size and showed that the proposed code set is optimal in special cases. Finally, We derive 2-D Golay complementary array set (GCAS) and Golay complementary set (GCS) from the proposed construction, which has application in uniform rectangular array (URA)-based massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system to achieve omnidirectional transmission. The simulation result shows the performance benefits of the derived codes. In essence, we show that the flexibility of the parameters of the proposed 2-D ZCACS makes it a good candidate for a wide range of use cases in wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of a Concatenated Code for Intersymbol Interference Wiretap Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a two-stage concatenated coding scheme for reliable and information-theoretically secure communication over intersymbol interference wiretap channels. Motivated by the theoretical coding strategies that achieve the secrecy capacity, our scheme integrates low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in the outer stage, forming a nested structure of wiretap codes, with trellis codes in the inner stage to improve achievable secure rates. The trellis code is specifically designed to transform the uniformly distributed codewords produced by the LDPC code stage into a Markov process, achieving tight lower bounds on the secrecy capacity. We further estimate the information leakage rate of the proposed coding scheme using an upper bound. To meet the weak secrecy criterion, we optimize degree distributions of the irregular LDPC codes at the outer stage, essentially driving the estimated upper bound on the information leakage rate to zero.</description>

      <title>Detecting Convolutional Codes: A Markovian Approach with LRT and DNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the unknown convolutional code corresponding to the given intercepted data is an important problem in military surveillance and in wireless communication. While a variety of code identification algorithms are available in the literature, the key contribution of our work lies in the novel solution and the corresponding analysis. In this paper, we focus on the situation when the given data corresponds to either of the two potential convolutional codes and the goal is to detect the correct code. We first provide a new interpretation of the convolutional code as a Markov chain, which is more suitable for analyzing the code detection problem. Our problem then gets reduced to identifying between the two Markov chains. We provide the closed-form expressions for the corresponding state transition matrices and estimate the error exponent for the underlying likelihood ratio test (LRT). We also provide a computationally efficient BCJR-based method for computing the likelihoods required for the LRT. We observe that BCJR-based likelihoods suffer from numerical issues for a longer data sequence, and hence, in this case, we design neural networks that have been found to achieve the optimal performance of the LRT.</description>

      <title>Mixing Time of the Proximal Sampler in Relative Fisher Information via Strong Data Processing Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixing time guarantee for sampling in relative Fisher information via the Proximal Sampler algorithm, which is an approximate proximal discretization of the Langevin dynamics. We show that when the target probability distribution is strongly log-concave, the relative Fisher information converges exponentially fast along the Proximal Sampler; this matches the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the continuous-time Langevin dynamics for strongly log-concave target. When combined with a standard implementation of the Proximal Sampler via rejection sampling, this exponential convergence rate provides a high-accuracy iteration complexity guarantee for the Proximal Sampler in relative Fisher information when the target distribution is strongly log-concave and log-smooth. Our proof proceeds by establishing a strong data processing inequality for relative Fisher information along the Gaussian channel under strong log-concavity, and a data processing inequality along the reverse Gaussian channel for a special distribution. The forward and reverse Gaussian channels compose to form the Proximal Sampler, and these data processing inequalities imply the exponential convergence rate of the relative Fisher information along the Proximal Sampler.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation for Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS to Integrate Sensing the I/O Relation and Data Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. The filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single Zak-OTFS point (impulse) pulsone waveform, and the I/O relation can be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. Predictability opens up the possibility of a model-free mode of operation. The time-domain realization of a Zak-OTFS point pulsone is a pulse train modulated by a tone, hence the name, pulsone. The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of a pulsone is about $15$ dB, and we describe a general method for constructing a spread pulsone for which the time-domain realization has a PAPR of about 6dB. We construct the spread pulsone by applying a type of discrete spreading filter to a Zak-OTFS point pulsone. The self-ambiguity function of the point pulsone is supported on the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, and by applying a discrete chirp filter, we obtain a spread pulsone with a self-ambiguity function that is supported on a rotated lattice ${\Lambda^*}$. We show that if the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to ${\Lambda^*}$ then the effective DD domain filter taps can simply be read off from the cross-ambiguity between the channel response to the spread pulsone and the transmitted spread pulsone. If, in addition, the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, then in an OTFS frame consisting of a spread pilot pulsone and point data pulsones, after cancelling the received signal corresponding to the spread pulsone, we can recover the channel response to any data pulsone.</description>

      <title>The combinatorial structure and value distributions of plateaued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study combinatorial properties of plateaued functions $F \colon \mathbb{F}_p^n \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p^m$. All quadratic functions, bent functions and most known APN functions are plateaued, so many cryptographic primitives rely on plateaued functions as building blocks. The main focus of our study is the interplay of the Walsh transform and linearity of a plateaued function, its differential properties, and their value distributions, i.e., the sizes of image and preimage sets. In particular, we study the special case of ''almost balanced'' plateaued functions, which only have two nonzero preimage set sizes, generalizing for instance all monomial functions. We achieve several direct connections and (non)existence conditions for these functions, showing for instance that plateaued $d$-to-$1$ functions (and thus plateaued monomials) only exist for a very select choice of $d$, and we derive for all these functions their linearity as well as bounds on their differential uniformity. We also specifically study the Walsh transform of plateaued APN functions and their relation to their value distribution.</description>

      <title>Decoding Quantum LDPC Codes using Collaborative Check Node Removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fault tolerance of quantum protocols require on-par contributions from error-correcting codes and its suitable decoders. One of the most explored error-correcting codes is the family of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes. Although faster than many of the reported decoders for QLDPC codes, iterative decoders fails to produce suitable success rates due to the colossal degeneracy and short cycles intrinsic to these codes. We present a strategy to improve the performance of the iterative decoders based on a collaborative way to use the message passing of the iterative decoders and stabilizer check node removal from the quantum code's Tanner graph. We particularly introduce a notion of qubit separation, which gives us a metric to analyze and improve the min-sum Belief Propagation (BP) based iterative decoder's performance towards harmful configurations of QLDPC codes. We further show that an integration of information measurements (IM) for qubits and it's adjacent stabilizer checks, can be exploited to extract far better performing results from the collaborative decoding architecture compared to its classical predecessor. We analyze the performance of the proposed collaborative decoding architecture, in the context of Generalized Hypergraph Product (GHP) codes. We discuss that the collaborative decoding architecture overcomes iterative decoding failures regarding the harmful trapping set configurations by increasing the separation of trapped qubits without incurring any significant overhead.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Multivariate Information Rates in Networks of Random Processes</title>

Abstract: The Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing high-order interdependencies in complex network systems. However, its application to dynamic processes remains challenging due to the implicit assumption of memorylessness, which often falls in real-world scenarios. In this work, we introduce the framework of Partial Information Rate Decomposition (PIRD) that extends PID to random processes with temporal correlations. By leveraging mutual information rate (MIR) instead of mutual information (MI), our approach decomposes the dynamic information shared by multivariate random processes into unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions obtained aggregating information rate atoms in a principled manner. To solve PIRD, we define a pointwise redundancy rate function based on the minimum MI principle applied locally in the frequency-domain representation of the processes. The framework is validated in benchmark simulations of Gaussian systems, demonstrating its advantages over traditional PID in capturing temporal correlations and showing how the spectral representation may reveal scale-specific higher-order interactions that are obscured in the time domain. Furthermore, we apply PIRD to a physiological network comprising cerebrovascular and cardiovascular variables, revealing frequency-dependent redundant information exchange during a protocol of postural stress. Our results highlight the necessity of accounting for the full temporal statistical structure and spectral content of vector random processes to meaningfully perform information decomposition in network systems with dynamic behavior such as those typically encountered in neuroscience and physiology.</description>

      <title>What Makes the Preferred Thinking Direction for LLMs in Multiple-choice Questions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models usually use left-to-right (L2R) autoregressive factorization. However, L2R factorization may not always be the best inductive bias. Therefore, we investigate whether alternative factorizations of the text distribution could be beneficial in some tasks. We investigate right-to-left (R2L) training as a compelling alternative, focusing on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) as a test bed for knowledge extraction and reasoning. Through extensive experiments across various model sizes (2B-8B parameters) and training datasets, we find that R2L models can significantly outperform L2R models on several MCQ benchmarks, including logical reasoning, commonsense understanding, and truthfulness assessment tasks. Our analysis reveals that this performance difference may be fundamentally linked to multiple factors including calibration, computability, and directional conditional entropy. We analyze the impact of these factors through controlled simulation studies using arithmetic tasks, where the impacting factors can be better disentangled. Our work demonstrates that exploring alternative factorizations of the text distribution can lead to improvements in LLM capabilities and provides theoretical insights into optimal factorization towards approximating human language distribution, and when each reasoning order might be more advantageous. Our code and checkpoints are released at https://github.com/apple/ml-reversal-blessing.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>
