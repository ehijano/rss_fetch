      <title>Nonlinear Propagation of Non-Gaussian Uncertainties: Theory and Applications to Spacecraft Trajectory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for propagating uncertainties in dynamical systems building on high-order Taylor expansions of the flow and moment-generating functions (MGFs). Unlike prior methods that focus on Gaussian distributions, our approach leverages the relationship between MGFs and distribution moments to extend high-order uncertainty propagation techniques to non-Gaussian scenarios. This significantly broadens the applicability of these methods to a wider range of problems and uncertainty types. High-order moment computations are performed one-off and symbolically, reducing the computational burden of the technique to the calculation of Taylor series coefficients around a nominal trajectory, achieved by efficiently integrating the system's variational equations. Furthermore, the use of the proposed approach in combination with event transition tensors, allows for accurate propagation of uncertainties at specific events, such as the landing surface of a celestial body, the crossing of a predefined Poincar\'e section, or the trigger of an arbitrary event during the propagation. Via numerical simulations we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various astrodynamics applications, including the unperturbed and perturbed two-body problem, and the circular restricted three-body problem, showing that it accurately propagates non-Gaussian uncertainties both at future times and at event manifolds.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Explanations in Multi-Model Systems through Probabilistic Argumentation</title>

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become critical in enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI systems, especially as these systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Despite the progress made in developing explanation generation techniques for individual machine learning (ML) models, significant challenges remain in achieving coherent and comprehensive explanations in multi-model systems. This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on the explanation reconciliation problem (ERP) within multi-model systems. Traditional explanation generation technique often fall short in multi-model systems contexts, where explanations from different models can conflict and fail to form a cohesive narrative. Through the use of probabilistic argumentation and knowledge representation techniques, we propose a framework for generating holistic explanations that align with human cognitive processes. Our approach involves mapping uncertain explanation information to probabilistic arguments and introducing criteria for explanation reconciliation based on user perspectives such as optimism, pessimism, fairness. In addition, we introduce the relative independence assumption to optimise the search space for computational explanations.</description>

      <title>A Finite Expression Method for Solving High-Dimensional Committor Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path theory (TPT) is a mathematical framework for quantifying rare transition events between a pair of selected metastable states $A$ and $B$. Central to TPT is the committor function, which describes the probability to hit the metastable state $B$ prior to $A$ from any given starting point of the phase space. Once the committor is computed, the transition channels and the transition rate can be readily found. The committor is the solution to the backward Kolmogorov equation with appropriate boundary conditions. However, solving it is a challenging task in high dimensions due to the need to mesh a whole region of the ambient space. In this work, we explore the finite expression method (FEX, Liang and Yang (2022)) as a tool for computing the committor. FEX approximates the committor by an algebraic expression involving a fixed finite number of nonlinear functions and binary arithmetic operations. The optimal nonlinear functions, the binary operations, and the numerical coefficients in the expression template are found via reinforcement learning. The FEX-based committor solver is tested on several high-dimensional benchmark problems. It gives comparable or better results than neural network-based solvers. Most importantly, FEX is capable of correctly identifying the algebraic structure of the solution which allows one to reduce the committor problem to a low-dimensional one and find the committor with any desired accuracy.</description>
