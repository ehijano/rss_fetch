      <title>Infinite-order combinatorial Transverse Intersection Algebra TIA via the probabilistic wiggling model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs a graded-commutative, associative, differential Transverse Intersection Algebra TIA {on the torus (in any dimension) with its cubical decomposition by using a probabilistic wiggling interpretation. This structure agrees with the combinatorial graded intersection algebra (graded by codimension) defined by transversality on pairs of `cuboidal chains' which are in general position. In order to define an intersection of cuboids which are not necessarily in general position, the boundaries of the cuboids are considered to be `wiggled' by a distance small compared with the lattice parameter, according to a suitable probability distribution and then almost always the wiggled cuboids will be in general position, producing a transverse intersection with new probability distributions on the bounding sides. In order to make a closed theory, each geometric cuboid appears in an infinite number of forms with different probability distributions on the wiggled boundaries. The resulting structure is commutative, associative and satisfies the product rule with respect to the natural boundary operator deduced from the geometric boundary of the wiggled cuboids.
  This TIA can be viewed as a combinatorial analogue of differential forms in which the continuity of space has been replaced by a lattice with corrections to infinite order. See the comparison to Whitney forms at the end of the paper.
  For application to fluid algebra we also consider the same construction starting with the $2h$ cubical complex instead of the $h$ cubical complex. The adjoined higher order elements will be identical to those required in the $h$ cubical complex.
  The $d$-dimensional theory is a tensor product of $d$ copies of the one-dimensional theory.</description>

      <title>Parametrized scissors congruence $K$-theory of manifolds and cobordism categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a parametrized version of scissors congruence $K$-theory of manifolds, which in particular gives a topologized version of the scissors congruence $K$-theory of oriented manifolds, and we describe this spectrum as mediating between the cobordism category and usual algebraic $K$-theory of spaces. We show that on $\pi_0$, the scissors congruence $K$-theory of oriented manifolds agrees with a version of the cobordism category where we allow free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Confidence Bands for Multiparameter Persistence Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiparameter persistent homology is a generalization of classical persistent homology, a central and widely-used methodology from topological data analysis, which takes into account density estimation and is an effective tool for data analysis in the presence of noise. Similar to its classical single-parameter counterpart, however, it is challenging to compute and use in practice due to its complex algebraic construction. In this paper, we study a popular and tractable invariant for multiparameter persistent homology in a statistical setting: the multiparameter persistence landscape. We derive a functional central limit theorem for multiparameter persistence landscapes, from which we compute confidence bands, giving rise to one of the first statistical inference methodologies for multiparameter persistence landscapes. We provide an implementation of confidence bands and demonstrate their application in a machine learning task on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on a classical embedding theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository note, recent results of Kishimoto and Matsushita on triangulated manifolds are linked to the classical criterion on the normal Stiefel-Whitney classes for existence of an embedding of a smooth closed manifold into Euclidean space of given dimension. We also look back at Atiyah's K-theoretic condition for the existence of a smooth embedding.</description>

      <title>Andr\'{e}-Quillen Cohomology and $k$-invariants of simplicial categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Harpaz-Nuiten-Prasma interpretation of the Dwyer-Kan-Smith cohomology of a simplicial category $\mathcal{X}$, we obtain a cochain complex for the Andr\'{e}-Quillen cohomology groups in which the $k$-invariants for $\mathcal{X}$ take value. Given a map of simplicial categories $\phi:\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow P^{(n-1)} \mathcal{X}$ into a Postnikov section of $\mathcal{X}$, we use a homotopy colimit decomposition of $\mathcal{Y}$ to study the obstruction to lifting $\phi$ to $P^{(n)}\mathcal{X}$. In particular, an explicit description of this obstruction for the boundary of a cube can be used to recover various higher homotopy invariants of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

      <title>An obstruction theory for strictly commutative algebras in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first in a sequence of articles exploring the relationship between commutative algebras and $E_\infty$-algebras in characteristic $p$ and mixed characteristic. In this paper we lay the groundwork by defining a new class of cohomology operations over $\mathbb F_p$ called cotriple products, generalising Massey products. We compute the secondary cohomology operations for a strictly commutative dg-algebra and the obstruction theories these induce, constructing several counterexamples to characteristic 0 behaviour, one of which answers a question of Campos, Petersen, Robert-Nicoud and Wierstra. We construct some families of higher cotriple products and comment on their behaviour. Finally, we distingush a subclass of cotriple products that we call higher Steenrod operations and conclude with our main theorem, which says that $E_\infty$-algebras can be rectified if and only if the higher Steenrod operations vanish coherently.</description>

      <title>Enumerating Smooth Structures on $\mathbb{C}P^3\times\mathbb{S}^k$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the concordance inertia group of the product $M \times \mathbb{S}^k$, where $M$ is a simply connected, closed, smooth 6-manifold, for $1 \leq k \leq 10$, using known low-dimensional computations of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. Specifically, for $M = \mathbb{C}P^3$, we determine the inertia group of $\mathbb{C}P^3 \times \mathbb{S}^k$ for $2 \leq k \leq 7, k \neq 6$, and establish a diffeomorphism classification of all smooth manifolds homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}P^3 \times \mathbb{S}^k$ for $1 \leq k \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>Improving Mapper's Robustness by Varying Resolution According to Lens-Space Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modification of the Mapper algorithm that removes the assumption of a single resolution scale across semantic space and improves the robustness of the results under change of parameters. Our work is motivated by datasets where the density in the image of the Morse-type function (the lens-space density) varies widely. For such datasets, tuning the resolution parameter of Mapper is difficult because small changes can lead to significant variations in the output. By improving the robustness of the output under these variations, our method makes it easier to tune the resolution for datasets with highly variable lens-space density. This improvement is achieved by generalising the type of permitted cover for Mapper and incorporating the lens-space density into the cover. Furthermore, we prove that for covers satisfying natural assumptions, the graph produced by Mapper still converges in bottleneck distance to the Reeb graph of the Rips complex of the data, while possibly capturing more topological features than a standard Mapper cover. Finally, we discuss implementation details and present the results of computational experiments. We also provide an accompanying reference implementation.</description>
