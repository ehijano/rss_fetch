      <title>General Fractional Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General fractional dynamics (GFDynamics) can be viewed as an interdisciplinary science, in which the non-local properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems are studied by using of general fractional calculus, equations with general fractional integrals (GFI) and derivatives (GFD), or general nonlocal mappings with discrete time. The GFDynamics implies research and obtaining results concerning of general form of nonlocality, which can be described by general form operator kernels, and not its particular implementations and representations. In this paper, it is proposed the concept of "general nonlocal maps" that are exact solutions of equations with GFI and GFD at discrete points. In these maps, the non-locality is determined by the kernels that are associated to the Sonin and Luchko kernels of general fractional integrals and derivatives, which are used in initial equations. Using general fractional calculus, we consider fractional systems with general non-locality in time, which are described by equations with general fractional operators and periodic kicks. Equations with GFI and GFD of arbitrary order are also used to derive general nonlocal maps. Exact solutions for these general fractional differential and integral equations with kicks are obtained. These exact solutions with discrete time points are used to derive general nonlocal maps without approximations. Some examples of non-locality in time are described.</description>

      <title>From Hyperbolic to Non-Hyperbolic Open Billiards: An Entropy and Scaling Law Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the escape dynamics in an open circular billiard under the influence of a uniform gravitational field. The system properties are investigated as a function of the particle total energy and the size of two symmetrically placed holes in the boundary. Using a suite of quantitative tools including escape basins, basin entropy ($S_b$), mean escape time ($\bar{\tau}$), and survival probability ($P(n)$), we characterize a system that transitions from a fully chaotic, hyperbolic regime at low energies to a non-hyperbolic, mixed phase space at higher energies. Our results demonstrate that this transition is marked by the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) islands. We show that both the basin entropy and the mean escape time are sensitive to this transition, with the former peaking and the latter increasing sharply as the sticky KAM islands appear. The survival probability analysis confirms this dynamical picture, shifting from a pure exponential decay in the hyperbolic regime to a power-law-like decay with a saturation plateau in the mixed regime, which directly quantifies the measure of trapped orbits. In the high-energy limit, the system dynamics approaches an integrable case, leading to a corresponding decrease in complexity as measured by both $S_b$ and $\bar{\tau}$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Complexity Changes in Diseased ECG Signals for Enhanced Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex dynamics of the heart are reflected in its electrical activity, captured through electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this study we use nonlinear time series analysis to understand how ECG complexity varies with cardiac pathology. Using the large PTB-XL dataset, we extracted nonlinear measures from lead II ECGs, and cross-channel metrics (leads II, V2, AVL) using Spearman correlations and mutual information. Significant differences between diseased and healthy individuals were found in almost all measures between healthy and diseased classes, and between 5 diagnostic superclasses ($p&lt;.001$). Moreover, incorporating these complexity quantifiers into machine learning models substantially improved classification accuracy measured using area under the ROC curve (AUC) from 0.86 (baseline) to 0.87 (nonlinear measures) and 0.90 (including cross-time series metrics).</description>

      <title>Ruelle-Pollicott Decay of Out-of-Time-Order Correlators in Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum of weakly open extensions of the dynamics, where the slowest decay rate -- the Liouvillian gap -- encodes relaxation. Here we study the kicked Ising spin chain and show that the long-time exponential decay of the OTOC in the isolated system occurs at a rate equal to twice this intrinsic gap. This correspondence persists even in crossover regimes between integrability and chaos, demonstrating that the Liouvillian spectrum provides a unified framework for understanding relaxation and irreversibility in closed many-body quantum systems.</description>
