      <title>Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs and Search Engines: A Crossroads for Answering Users' Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much has been discussed about how Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs and Search Engines can be combined in a synergistic manner. A dimension largely absent from current academic discourse is the user perspective. In particular, there remain many open questions regarding how best to address the diverse information needs of users, incorporating varying facets and levels of difficulty. This paper introduces a taxonomy of user information needs, which guides us to study the pros, cons and possible synergies of Large Language Models, Knowledge Graphs and Search Engines. From this study, we derive a roadmap for future research.</description>

      <title>ELIZA Reanimated: The world's first chatbot restored on the world's first time sharing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ELIZA, created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in the early 1960s, is usually considered the world's first chatbot. It was developed in MAD-SLIP on MIT's CTSS, the world's first time-sharing system, on an IBM 7094. We discovered an original ELIZA printout in Prof. Weizenbaum's archives at MIT, including an early version of the famous DOCTOR script, a nearly complete version of the MAD-SLIP code, and various support functions in MAD and FAP. Here we describe the reanimation of this original ELIZA on a restored CTSS, itself running on an emulated IBM 7094. The entire stack is open source, so that any user of a unix-like OS can run the world's first chatbot on the world's first time-sharing system.</description>

      <title>Inferring Interpretable Models of Fragmentation Functions using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly making its path into natural sciences, including high-energy physics. We present the first study that infers, directly from experimental data, a functional form of fragmentation functions. The latter represent a key ingredient to describe physical observables measured in high-energy physics processes that involve hadron production, and predict their values at different energy. Fragmentation functions can not be calculated in theory and have to be determined instead from data. Traditional approaches rely on global fits of experimental data using a pre-assumed functional form inspired from phenomenological models to learn its parameters. This novel approach uses a ML technique, namely symbolic regression, to learn an analytical model from measured charged hadron multiplicities. The function learned by symbolic regression resembles the Lund string function and describes the data well, thus representing a potential candidate for use in global FFs fits. This study represents an approach to follow in such QCD-related phenomenology studies and more generally in sciences.</description>
