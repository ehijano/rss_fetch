      <title>The Quark Pauli Principle and the Transmutation of Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase space density, $\rho^Q$, of quarks in nuclei is studied using realistic models of unintegrated quark distributions, known as transverse momentum densities (TMDs). If this density exceeds unity for matter at normal nuclear densities, the effects of the quark Pauli principle must play a role in nuclei, and models in which the nucleon density at low momentum is small (Quarkyonic matter) may become a starting point for an entirely new description of nuclei. We denote the nuclear density for which $\rho^Q=1$ to be a transmutation density, $n_T$, because quark degrees of freedom must be relevant at that density. Including the TMDs of [G. de Teramond et. al, \href{DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.182001} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 120}, 182002, (2018)] for the valence quarks and phenomenological TMDs for the sea quarks we find that $n_T=0.17 \pm 0.04\,\rm fm^{-3}$, the density of normal nuclear matter. Some of fhe implications of this finding are discussed.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This solves a 90-year old mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>

      <title>Fox's H-Functions: A Gentle Introduction Through Astrophysical Thermonuclear Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Needed for cosmological and stellar nucleosynthesis, we are studying the closed-form analytic evaluation of thermonuclear reaction rates. In this context, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of three distinct velocity distributions, namely the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the pathway distribution, and the Mittag-Leffer distribution. We emphasize the utilization of Meijer G-function and Fox H-function which are special functions of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Light nuclei production in isobaric $^{96}$Ru + $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Ru + $^{96}$Ru collisions at 7.7-200 GeV from a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of light nuclei in isobaric $^{96}_{44}$Ru + $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr + $^{96}_{40}$Zr collisions, ranging from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7 to 200 GeV, are studied using the string melting version of A Multi Phase Transport (AMPT) model in combination with a coalescence approach to light nuclei production. From the calculated yields, transverse momentum $p_{T}$ spectra, and rapidity dependences of light nuclei $p$, $n$, $d$, $t$, ${}^{3}$He, we find that the Ru+Ru/Zr+Zr ratios for the yields of these particles exceed unity with the inclusion of a quadrupole deformation $\beta_{ 2 }$ and octupole deformation $\beta_{ 3 }$ as well as the neutron skins. We also find that heavier particles have a larger deviation from unity. Furthermore, we find that as the collision energy increases, the influence of isospin effects on the production of light nuclei in isobar collisions gradually decreases, while the influence of nuclear structure becomes more significant, particularly evident from the energy dependence of the deuteron ratio, which is unaffected by isospin effects.</description>

      <title>Investigation of suppression of $\Upsilon(nS)$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary purpose of studying quarkonium production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is to understand the properties of the quark-gluon plasma. At various collision systems, measurements of quarkonium states of different binding energies, such as $\Upsilon(nS)$, can provide comprehensive information. A model study has been performed to investigate the modification of $\Upsilon(nS)$ production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 5.02 TeV and Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 200 GeV. The Monte-Carlo simulation study is performed with a publicly available hydrodynamic simulation package for the quark-gluon plasma medium and a theoretical calculation of temperature-dependent thermal width of $\Upsilon(nS)$ considering the gluo-dissociation and inelastic parton scattering for dissociation inside the medium. In addition, we perform a systematic study with different descriptions of initial collision geometry and formation time of $\Upsilon(nS)$ to investigate their impacts on yield modification. The model calculation with a varied parameter set can describe the experimental data of $\Upsilon(nS)$ in Pb-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV and $\Upsilon(2S)$ in Au-Au collisions at 200 GeV but underestimates the modification of $\Upsilon(1S)$ at the lower collision energy. The nuclear absorption mechanism is explored to understand the discrepancy between the data and simulation.</description>

      <title>High energy nucleus-nucleus collisions with accounting for Coulomb interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential elastic cross sections of $^{12}$C - $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O - $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne - $^{20}$Ne nuclei scattering are calculated in the complete Glauber theory with the account of the modification due to Coulomb interaction and form factor effects. The role of the Coulomb interaction is shown to be significant mainly in the diffractive minima. The results of the complete Coulomb calculations are noticeably different from those obtained in the Born approximation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $^{115}$In $\beta$ decay through the spectral moment method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the $^{115}$In $\beta$-decay energy spectrum through the spectral moment method (SMM), previously introduced in the context of $^{113}$Cd $\beta$ decay. The spectral moments $\mu_n$ are defined as averaged $n^{\rm th}$ powers of the $\beta$ particle energy, characterizing the spectrum normalization ($n=0$) and shape ($n\geq 1$) above a given threshold. For $^{115}$In, we consider three independent datasets characterized by different thresholds. We also consider three nuclear model calculations with two free parameters: the ratio of axial-vector to vector couplings, $r=g_{\rm A}/g_{\rm V}$, and the small vector-like relativistic nuclear matrix element (NME), $s=s$-NME. By using the most recent of the three datasets, we show that the first few spectral moments can determine $(r,\, s)$ values in good agreement with those obtained by full-fledged experimental fits. We then work out the SMM results for the other datasets. We find that, although $g_{\rm A}$ quenching is generally favored, the preferred quenching factors may differ considerably depending on the chosen experimental data and nuclear models. We discuss various issues affecting both the overall normalization and the low-energy behaviour of the measured and computed spectra, and their joint effects on the experimentally quoted half-life values. Further $^{115}$In $\beta$-decay data at the lowest possible energy threshold appear to be crucial to clarify these issues.</description>

      <title>Global Polarization of (Anti-)Hypertriton in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particles of non-zero spin produced in non-central heavy-ion collisions are expected to be polarized along the direction perpendicular to the reaction plane because of their spin-orbit interactions in the produced matter, and this has indeed been observed for many hyperons and vector mesons. Here, we show that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda\text{H}$), which is the lightest hypernucleus, is also polarized in these collisions. Using the coalescence model based on the kinetic freezeout baryons for light (hyper-)nuclei production, we find that the angular distribution of the decay product of polarized $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$ is highly sensitive to the spin configuration of its wavefunction, providing a novel way to determine its spin structure. We also predict the beam energy dependence of $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$ and ${^3_{\bar{\Lambda}}}\overline{\rm H}$ polarizations in heavy-ion collisions from a few GeV to several TeV based on the measured $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ polarizations. We further discuss the possibility of studying the spin correlations among nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons in the produced hadronic matter from the measured $^3_\Lambda\text{H}$ polarization in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>On model emulation and closure tests for 3+1D relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nuclear and particle physics, reconciling sophisticated simulations with experimental data is vital for understanding complex systems like the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) generated in heavy-ion collisions. However, computational demands pose challenges, motivating using Gaussian Process emulators for efficient parameter extraction via Bayesian calibration. We conduct a comparative analysis of Gaussian Process emulators in heavy-ion physics to identify the most adept emulator for parameter extraction with minimal uncertainty. Our study contributes to advancing computational techniques in heavy-ion physics, enhancing our ability to interpret experimental data and understand QGP properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm by using the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation that $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $ is a possible heaviest $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nucleus whose life time is long enough to be measured on accelerator experiment. We estimate the proton-emission and alpha-decay half lives of $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $. The estimated proton-emission half life ranges from $ 0.1 \, \mathrm{ps} $ to $ 10 \, \mathrm{ns} $, while the alpha decay can be safely neglected.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated for varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence relation between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crust region is a tiny fraction of neutron stars, but it has a variety of physical properties and plays an important role in astronomical observations. One of the properties characterizing the crust is the elasticity. In this review, with the approach of asteroseismology, we systematically examine neutron star oscillations excited by crust elasticity, adopting the Cowling approximation. In particular, by identifying the quasi-periodic oscillations observed in magnetar flares with the torsional oscillations, we make a constraint on the nuclear saturation parameters. In addition, we also discuss how the shear and interface modes depend on the neutron star properties. Once one detects an additional signal associated with neutron star oscillations, one can get a more severe constraint on the saturation parameters and/or neutron star properties, which must be a qualitatively different constraint obtained from terrestrial experiments, and help us to complementarily understand astrophysics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Pole structure of $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ via machine learning and uniformized S-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probed the pole structure of the $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ using a trained deep neural network. The training dataset was generated using uniformized independent S-matrix poles to ensure that the obtained interpretation is as model-independent as possible. To prevent possible ambiguity in the interpretation of the pole structure, we included the contribution from the off-diagonal element of the S-matrix. Five out of the six neural networks we trained favor $P_\psi^{N}(4312)^{+}$ as possibly having a three-pole structure, with one pole on each of the unphysical sheets - a first in its report. The two poles can be associated to a pole-shadow pair which is a characteristic of a true resonance. On the other hand, the last pole is most likely associated with the coupled-channel effect. The combined effect of these poles produced a peak below the $\Sigma^{+}_C\bar{D}^0$ which mimic the line shape of a hadronic molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the age-old quest to construct a geometric model of a quantum particle. While static classical particle models have largely been dismissed, the focus has now shifted to intricate dynamic models that hold the promise of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. We propose that matter particles can be described as radiation confined within dynamically curved spacetime regions, without the need for quantization of space and time, and using standard field equations and natural Planck units. Specifically, we investigate a cyclic or oscillating radiation-dominated micro cosmos undergoing repeated bouncing. Our methodology employs integration, with carefully defined initial conditions. The results include several observable properties characteristic of quantum particles. We calculate the total mass, revealing a compelling inverse proportionality between mass and radius identical with the de Broglie relationship. Applying this model to protons, we discover a profound and surprisingly simple relationship between the proton's radius and mass expressed in Planck units. This enables a definition of the proton radius that aligns remarkably well with the 2018 CODATA value. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the radial density profile of the proton (or nucleon), averaged over a cycle time, increases toward the center. The problem of embedding the micro cosmos within a background spacetime is also described. These results underscore the relevance of general relativity in the domain of nuclear physics. Moreover, the model offers a fresh perspective that can stimulate new ideas in the ongoing quest to unify general relativity with quantum physics.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have performed systematic shell-model calculations for Bi isotopes with $A=$ 204-213 using KHH7B and KHM3Y effective interactions. We have reported yrast and non-yrast shell-model states corresponding to the available experimental data. From the comparison with the experimental data, we could assign spin and parity of several unconfirmed states. We have also calculated electromagnetic properties and compared them with the available experimental data and predicted where experimental data are not available. This study also includes a detailed discussion of multiple isomeric states based on computed shell-model configurations and their respective half-lives.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>An Infra-Red Fixed-Point in QCD with a Dilaton in Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 1/2$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>The Magic in Nuclear and Hypernuclear Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Toward an improved understanding of the role of quantum information in nuclei and exotic matter, we examine the magic (non-stabilizerness) in low-energy strong interaction processes. As stabilizer states can be prepared efficiently using classical computers, and include classes of entangled states, it is magic and fluctuations in magic, along with entanglement, that determine resource requirements for quantum simulations. As a measure of fluctuations in magic induced by scattering, the "magic power" of the S-matrix is introduced. Using experimentally-determined scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters, the magic power in nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering, along with the magic in the deuteron, are found to exhibit interesting features. The $\Sigma^-$-baryon is identified as a potential candidate catalyst for enhanced spreading of magic and entanglement in dense matter, depending on in-medium decoherence.</description>

      <title>Pulsar as a Weber detector of gravitational waves and a probe to its internal phase transitions</title>

Abstract: It is believed that cores of neutron stars provide a natural laboratory where exotic high baryon density QCD phases may exist.The theoretically well established {\it neutron superfluid phase} is also believed to be found only inside neutron stars. Focus on neutron stars has intensified in recent years with the direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merger, which has allowed the possibility of directly probing the properties of the interior of a neutron star. A remarkable phenomenon manifested by rapidly rotating neutron stars is in their {\it avatar} as {\it Pulsars}. The accuracy of pulsar timing allowed the first indirect detection of GWs from a BNS system and opened up a few exciting possibilities. Any pulsar deformation, even if incredibly tiny, can leave imprints on the pulses by introducing tiny perturbations of the moment of inertia (MI) tensor components. While the diagonal MI components of the perturbed MI tensor affect the pulse timings, the off-diagonal components lead to the pulsar's wobbling and affecting the pulse profile. This opens up an opportunity to explore various phase transitions inside a pulsar core by induced density fluctuations through the observable effects on the pulse timing and profile. Such perturbations also naturally induce a rapidly changing quadrupole moment of the star, thereby providing a new source of GW emission. Another remarkable possibility arises when we consider the effect of an external GW on a neutron star. With the possibility of detecting any minute changes in its configuration through pulse observations, the neutron star has the potential to perform as a Weber detector of GWs. This brief review focuses on these specific aspects of a pulsar, specifically on the type of physics that can be probed by utilizing the effect of changes in the MI tensor on pulse properties.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for fractional topological objects in SU(3) gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continued development of models that propose the existence of fractional topological objects in the Yang-Mills vacuum has called for a quantitative method to study the topological structure of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory. We present an original numerical algorithm that can identify distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields and approximate the net charge contained within them. This analysis is performed for $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ colour at a range of temperatures crossing the deconfinement phase transition, allowing for an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with temperature. We find a promising consistency with the instanton-dyon model for the structure of the QCD vacuum at finite temperature. Several other quantities, such as object density and radial size, are also analysed to elicit a further understanding of the fundamental structure of ground-state gluon fields.</description>

      <title>Hybrid star models in the light of new multi-messenger data</title>

Abstract: Recent astrophysical mass inferences of compact stars HESS J1731-347 and PSR J0952-0607, with extremely small and large masses respectively, as well as the measurement of the neutron skin of Ca in the CREX experiment challenge and constrain the models of dense matter. We examine the concept of hybrid stars - objects containing quark cores surrounded by nucleonic envelopes - as models that account for these new data along with other inferences. We employ a family of 81 nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) with variable skewness and slope of symmetry energy at saturation density and a constant speed-of-sound EoS for quark matter. For each nucleonic EoS, a family of hybrid EoSs is generated by varying the transition density, the energy jump, and the speed of sound. These models are tested against the data from GW170817 and J1731-347, which favor low-density soft EoS and J0592-0607 and J0740+6620, which require high-density stiff EoS. The addition of J0592-0607's mass measurement to the constraints has no significant impact on the parameter space of the admissible EoS, but allows us to explore the potential effect of pulsars more massive than J0740+6620, if such exists. We then examine the occurrence of twin configurations and quantify the ranges of masses and radii that they can possess. It is shown that including J1731-347 data favors EoSs that predict low-mass twins with $M \lesssim 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ that can be realized if the deconfinement transition density is low. If combined with large speed of sound in quark matter such models allow for maximum masses of hybrid stars in $2.0$--$2.6\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>BBN catalysis by doubly charged particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider primordial nucleosynthesis in the presence of hypothetical quasi-stable doubly charged particles. Existence of $X^{--}$ with macroscopic lifetimes will lead to the formation of its bound states with $^4$He and other light elements, significantly facilitating the subsequent formation of lithium nuclei. From observational constraints on maximum allowable amount of lithium, that we update in this work, we derive strong constraints on the abundance and lifetime of $X^{--}$. In a likely cosmological freeze-out scenario with temperatures initially exceeding the mass of $X^{--}$, the BBN constrains the lifetime of these particles to be less than about 100 seconds. For parametrically long lifetimes, lithium abundance data constrain $X^{--}$ abundance to be less than $10^{-9}$ relative to protons, regardless of whether these particles decay or remain stable. Stable particles could saturate the dark matter density only if their mass is comparable to or in excess of $10^{10}$ GeV, and most of $X^{--}$ will be found in bound states with beryllium nuclei, so that chemically they would appear as abnormally heavy helium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$, and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryons, we determine for the first time the trajectory of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=\mathrm{cte})$ accurately. Our result at unphysical pion mass is consistent with the lattice simulation at $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV and the extrapolation to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral lagrangian, agrees perfectly well with previous analyses of experimental data. Contrary to other works, we predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, being consistent with the dominance of the LO interaction. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, we obtain that the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1595\pm8$ MeV, being a singlet representation, while the higher pole belongs to the octet with a mass $E^{(8)}=1600\pm4$ MeV. This can be tested in the future LQCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>
