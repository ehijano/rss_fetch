      <title>Precision Measurement of Lifetime and Branching Ratios of the $4f^{13}5d6s\,^1[5/2]_{5/2}$ state in Yb$^+$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report spectroscopic and time-resolved experimental observations to characterize the $[{\rm Xe}]4f^{13}(^2F^{o}_{5/2}){5d6s(}{^1\!D}){^{1}[5/2]^{o}_{5/2}}$ state in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ ions. We access this state from the metastable $4f^{14}5d (^2D_{3/2,5/2})$ manifold and observe an unexpectedly long lifetime of $\tau=37.9(9) \,\mu$s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population dynamics, high-fidelity detection and heralded state preparation, and optical pumping methods, we measure the branching ratios to the $^{2}D_{3/2}$, $^2D_{5/2}$, $^2S_{1/2}$ states to be 0.359(2), 0.639(2), 0.0023(16), respectively. The branching ratio to the $4f^{13}6s^{2}({^2F}_{7/2})$ is compatible with zero within our experimental resolution. We also report measurements of its Land\'e g-factor and the branching ratio of the ${^{2}{D}_{5/2}}$ to ${^{2}{S}_{1/2}}$ decay in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ to be 0.188(3), improving its relative uncertainty by an order of magnitude. Our measurements pave the way to a better understanding of the atomic structure of Yb$^+$ ions, which still lacks accurate numerical descriptions, and the use of high-lying excited states for partial detection and qubit manipulation in the omg architecture.</description>

      <title>Warm Vapor Rydberg EIT spectra in Doppler-free configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common approach for producing Rydberg atoms in warm vapor cells is with lasers arranged in a counter-propagating, collinear configuration. Doppler effects in these configurations reduce the efficiency of excitation to the Rydberg state while also producing broadened spectral features. In this work, we demonstrate a three-laser Doppler-free excitation using laser beams whose k-vectors sum to zero, resulting in an enhancement in the Rydberg density and narrowed spectral features. A three-times enhancement to Rydberg density along with a near four-times reduction in spectroscopic line-widths are observed compared to a collinear configuration. This Doppler-free configuration could prove beneficial to Rydberg atomic technologies, such as electric field sensing with small volumes or deterministic photon sources.</description>

      <title>Controlling rovibrational state populations of polar molecules in inhomogeneous electric fields of the Stark deceleration: molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified Stark-chirped rapid adiabatic passage technique for a robust rovibrational population transfer in the gas phase molecules in the presence of certain inhomogeneous electric fields. As an example application, the new state switching scheme is shown to greatly enhance the process of slowing polar ammonia molecules in the Stark decelerator. High-level quantum mechanical simulations show that a virtually complete population inversion between a selected pair of weak-field and strong-field seeking states of NH$_3$ can be achieved. Strong dc electric fields within the Stark decelerator are used as part of the rovibrational population transfer protocol. Classical-dynamics simulations for ammonia demonstrate notable improvements in the longitudinal phase space acceptance of the Stark decelerator upgraded with the state switching and an increased deceleration efficiency with respect to the standard Stark deceleration technique.</description>

      <title>Light-Assisted Collisions in Tweezer-Trapped Lanthanides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative investigation of one- and two-body light-mediated processes that occur to few erbium atoms in an optical tweezer, when exposed to near-resonant light. In order to study the intertwined effects of recoil heating, cooling and light-assisted collisions, we develop a first-principles Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the coupled dynamics of both the internal and external degrees of freedom of the atoms. After validating our theoretical model against experimental data, we use the predictive power of our code to guide our experiment and, in particular, we explore the performance of different transitions of erbium for light-assisted collisions in terms of their efficiency and fidelity for single-atom preparation.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic dynamics in a V-type quantum system by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shaped free electron vortices (SEVs) have recently been studied using atomic (1+2) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized (OC-CRCP) femtosecond laser pulses. By transitioning from the perturbative to the non-perturbative REMPI regime, we identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP). Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution (3D PMD), which we trace back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in anti-phase, leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of the $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Optical Lattice Clock with $1.7\times 10^{-20}$ Blackbody Radiation Stark Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the Stark perturbation from ambient thermal radiation is key to advancing the performance of many atomic frequency standards, including state-of-the-art optical lattice clocks (OLCs). We demonstrate a cryogenic OLC that utilizes a dynamically actuated radiation shield to control the perturbation at $1.7\times10^{-20}$ fractional frequency, a factor of $\sim$40 beyond the best OLC to date. Our shield furnishes the atoms with a near-ideal cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment by rejecting external thermal radiation at the part-per-million level during clock spectroscopy, overcoming a key limitation with previous cryogenic BBR control solutions in OLCs. While the lowest BBR shift uncertainty is realized with cryogenic operation, we further exploit the radiation control that the shield offers over a wide range of temperatures to directly measure and verify the leading BBR Stark dynamic correction coefficient for ytterbium. This independent measurement reduces the literature-combined uncertainty of this coefficient by 30%, thus benefiting state-of-the-art Yb OLCs operated at room temperature. We verify the static BBR coefficient for Yb at the low $10^{-18}$ level.</description>

      <title>Superconducting antiqubits achieve optimal phase estimation via unitary inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time. Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary inversion and benefit quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A high-sensitivity frequency counter for free-induction-decay signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time frequency readout of time-dependent pulsed signals with a high sensitivity are key elements in many applications using atomic devices, such as FID atomic magnetometers. In this paper, we propose a frequency measurement algorithm based on the Hilbert transform and implement such a scheme in a FPGA-based frequency counter. By testing pulsed exponential-decay oscillation signals in the frequency range of 10 to 500 kHz, this frequency counter shows a frequency sensitivity better than 0.1 mHz/Hz^(1/2) at 10 Hz, with an output rate of 200 Hz. When the output rate is increased to 1000 Hz, the sensitivity remains better than 0.4 mHz/Hz^(1/2) at 10 Hz. The performance on frequency sensitivity is comparable with results obtained by off-line nonlinear fitting processes. In addition, this frequency counter does not require the pre-knowledge of the analytic expression of the input signals. The realization of such a device paves the way for practical applications of highly-sensitive FID atomic magnetometers.</description>

      <title>Half-life determination of heavy ions in a storage ring considering feeding and depleting background processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-ion storage rings have relatively large momentum acceptance which allows for multiple ion species to circulate at the same time. This needs to be considered in radioactive decay measurements of highly charged ions, where atomic charge exchange reactions can significantly alter the intensities of parent and daughter ions. In this study, we investigate this effect using the decay curves of ion numbers in the recent $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$ bound-state beta decay experiment conducted using the Experimental Storage Ring at GSI Darmstadt. To understand the intricate dynamics of ion numbers, we present a set of differential equations that account for various atomic and nuclear reaction processes-bound-state beta decay, atomic electron recombination and capture, and electron ionization. By incorporating appropriate boundary conditions, we develop a set of differential equations that accurately simulate the decay curves of various simultaneously stored ions in the storage ring: $^{205}$Tl$^{81+}$, $^{205}$Pb$^{81+}$, $^{205}$Pb$^{82+}$, $^{200}$Hg$^{79+}$, and $^{200}$Hg$^{80+}$. Through a quantitative comparison between simulations and experimental data, we provide insights into the detailed reaction mechanisms governing stored heavy ions within the storage ring. Our approach effectively models charge-changing processes, reduces the complexity of the experimental setup, and provides a simpler method for measuring the decay half-lives of highly charged ions in storage rings.</description>

      <title>Engineering harmonic emission through spatial modulation in a Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.</description>

Abstract: We present ab initio calculations of one-electron quantum electrodynamical corrections to the second-order Zeeman splitting for the $1s_{1/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$, and $2p_{1/2}$ states in highly charged hydrogen-like ions. The self-energy correction is evaluated using the rigorous QED approach. The vacuum polarization correction is evaluated within the electric-loop approximation.

      <title>Fast real-time arbitrary waveform generation using graphic processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time arbitrary waveform generation (AWG) is essential in various engineering and research applications. This paper introduces a novel AWG architecture using an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) and a commercially available high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) card, both running on a desktop personal computer (PC). The GPU accelerates the "embarrassingly" data-parallel additive synthesis framework for AWG, and the DAC reconstructs the generated waveform in the analog domain at high speed. The AWG software is developed using the developer-friendly compute unified device architecture (CUDA) runtime application programming interface (API) from NVIDIA. With this architecture, we achieve a 586-fold increase in the speed of computing periodic radio-frequency (rf) arbitrary waveforms compared to a central processing unit (CPU). We also demonstrate two different pathways for dynamically controlling multi-tone rf waveforms, which we characterize by chirping individual single-frequency tones in the multi-tone waveforms. One pathway offers arbitrary simultaneous chirping of 1000 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at a sampling rate of 280 megasamples per second (MS/s) for a limited time duration of 35 ms. The other pathway offers simultaneous chirping of 340 individual Nyquist-limited single-frequency tones at 50 MS/s, or 55 individual tones at 280 MS/s for an arbitrary duration. Using the latter pathway, we demonstrate control over 5000-tone and 10,000-tone waveforms by chirping all of their constituent tones in groups of up to 100 tones. This AWG architecture is designed for creating large defect-free optical tweezer arrays of single neutral atoms or molecules for quantum simulation and quantum computation.</description>
