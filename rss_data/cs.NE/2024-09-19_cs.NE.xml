      <title>Model calibration using a parallel differential evolution algorithm in computational neuroscience: simulation of stretch induced nerve deficit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal damage, in the form of both brain and spinal cord injuries, is one of the major causes of disability and death in young adults worldwide. One way to assess the direct damage occurring after a mechanical insult is the simulation of the neuronal cells functional deficits following the mechanical event. In this study, we use a coupled mechanical electrophysiological model with several free parameters that are required to be calibrated against experimental results. The calibration is carried out by means of an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution, DE) that needs to evaluate each configuration of parameters on six different damage cases, each of them taking several minutes to compute. To minimise the simulation time of the parameter tuning for the DE, the stretch of one unique fixed-diameter axon with a simplified triggering process is used to speed up the calculations. The model is then leveraged for the parameter optimization of the more realistic bundle of independent axons, an impractical configuration to run on a single processor computer. To this end, we have developed a parallel implementation based on OpenMP that runs on a multi-processor taking advantage of all the available computational power. The parallel DE algorithm obtains good results, outperforming the best effort achieved by published manual calibration, in a fraction of the time. While not being able to fully capture the experimental results, the resulting nerve model provides a complex averaging framework for nerve damage simulation able to simulate gradual axonal functional alteration in a bundle.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?"
  This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $L$-Lipschitz function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $Ld/(2n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected $L$-Lipschitz ReLU MLP of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^d)$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Unlike previously known "large" classes of universal ReLU MLPs, the empirical Rademacher complexity of our class remains bounded even when its depth and width become arbitrarily large. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples.
  We achieve this by avoiding the standard approach to constructing optimal ReLU approximators, which sacrifices regularity by relying on small spikes. Instead, we introduce a new construction that perfectly fits together linear pieces using Kuhn triangulations and avoids these small spikes.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Explanations for Clustering Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms rely on complex optimisation processes that may be difficult to comprehend, especially for individuals who lack technical expertise. While many explainable artificial intelligence techniques exist for supervised machine learning, unsupervised learning -- and clustering in particular -- has been largely neglected. To complicate matters further, the notion of a ``true'' cluster is inherently challenging to define. These facets of unsupervised learning and its explainability make it difficult to foster trust in such methods and curtail their adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a new, model-agnostic technique for explaining clustering algorithms with counterfactual statements. Our approach relies on a novel soft-scoring method that captures the spatial information utilised by clustering models. It builds upon a state-of-the-art Bayesian counterfactual generator for supervised learning to deliver high-quality explanations. We evaluate its performance on five datasets and two clustering algorithms, and demonstrate that introducing soft scores to guide counterfactual search significantly improves the results.</description>

      <title>The Robustness of Spiking Neural Networks in Communication and its Application towards Network Efficiency in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have recently gained significant interest in on-chip learning in embedded devices and emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, to extend SNNs to a Federated Learning (FL) setting involving collaborative model training, the communication between the local devices and the remote server remains the bottleneck, which is often restricted and costly. In this paper, we first explore the inherent robustness of SNNs under noisy communication in FL. Building upon this foundation, we propose a novel Federated Learning with Top-K Sparsification (FLTS) algorithm to reduce the bandwidth usage for FL training. We discover that the proposed scheme with SNNs allows more bandwidth savings compared to ANNs without impacting the model's accuracy. Additionally, the number of parameters to be communicated can be reduced to as low as 6 percent of the size of the original model. We further improve the communication efficiency by enabling dynamic parameter compression during model training. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly outperform the baselines in terms of communication cost and model accuracy and are promising for practical network-efficient FL with SNNs.</description>

      <title>How the (Tensor-) Brain uses Embeddings and Embodiment to Encode Senses and Decode Symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor brain has been introduced as a computational model for perception and memory. We provide an overview of the tensor brain model, including recent developments. The tensor brain has two major layers: the representation layer and the index layer. The representation layer is a model for the subsymbolic global workspace from consciousness research. The state of the representation layer is the cognitive brain state. The index layer contains symbols for concepts, time instances, and predicates. In a bottom-up operation, the cognitive brain state is encoded by the index layer as symbolic labels. In a top-down operation, symbols are decoded and written to the representation layer. This feeds to earlier processing layers as embodiment. The top-down operation became the basis for semantic memory. The embedding vector of a concept forms the connection weights between its index and the representation layer. The embedding is the signature or ``DNA'' of a concept, which is decoded by the brain when its index is activated. It integrates all that is known about a concept from different experiences, modalities, and symbolic decodings. Although being computational, it has been suggested that the tensor brain might be related to the actual operation of the brain. The sequential nature of symbol generation might have been a prerequisite to the generation of natural language. We describe an attention mechanism and discuss multitasking by multiplexing. We emphasize the inherent multimodality of the tensor brain. Finally, we discuss embedded and symbolic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation theorem for neural networks with inputs from a topological vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study feedforward neural networks with inputs from a topological vector space (TVS-FNNs). Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, TVS-FNNs can process a broader range of inputs, including sequences, matrices, functions and more. We prove a universal approximation theorem for TVS-FNNs, which demonstrates their capacity to approximate any continuous function defined on this expanded input space.</description>

      <title>Centrality-Based Node Feature Augmentation for Robust Network Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network alignment (NA) is the task of discovering node correspondences across multiple networks. Although NA methods have achieved remarkable success in a myriad of scenarios, their effectiveness is not without additional information such as prior anchor links and/or node features, which may not always be available due to privacy concerns or access restrictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align+, a novel NA method built upon a recent state-of-the-art NA method, the so-called Grad-Align, that gradually discovers a part of node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To achieve this goal, Grad-Align+ consists of three key components: 1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network (GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over benchmark NA methods, (b) empirical validations as well as our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Fully tensorial approach to hypercomplex neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully tensorial theory of hypercomplex neural networks is given. It allows neural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is to observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three tensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is attractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial operations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional algebras.</description>

      <title>Evolving a Multi-Population Evolutionary-QAOA on Distributed QPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our research combines an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) with a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to update the ansatz parameters, in place of traditional gradient-based methods, and benchmark on the Max-Cut problem. We demonstrate that our Evolutionary-QAOA (E-QAOA) pairing performs on par or better than a COBYLA-based QAOA in terms of solution accuracy and variance, for $d$-3 regular graphs between 4 and 26 nodes, using both $max\_count$ and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for fitness function evaluations. Furthermore, we take our algorithm one step further and present a novel approach by presenting a multi-population EA distributed on two QPUs, which evolves independent and isolated populations in parallel, classically communicating elite individuals. Experiments were conducted on both simulators and IBM quantum hardware, and we investigated the relative performance accuracy and variance.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Quantum Computing and Fully Homomorphic Encryption: A Novel Computing Paradigm Shift in Privacy-Preserving ML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.</description>
