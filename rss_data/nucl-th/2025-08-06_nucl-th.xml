      <title>Variations of the crossover and first-order phase transition curve in modeling the QCD equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have shown that the transition from hadrons to quarks and gluons is a rapid crossover at $T = 155-160$ MeV at vanishing chemical potential. Many model calculations show that the transition is first-order at sufficiently high baryon chemical potential. It is then natural to expect the existence of a critical point where the crossover and first-order phase transition lines meet. We show how to embed a phase boundary that terminates at the critical point in a smooth background equation of state, using several different but closely related criteria, so as to yield the critical exponents and critical amplitude ratios expected of a transition in the 3D Ising and liquid-gas universality class. The crossover curves can be tuned to pass through experimental freeze-out data from heavy ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The resulting equations of state can be used in hydrodynamic simulations of these collisions to probe the existence of a critical point and corresponding first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Response of asymmetric nuclear matter studied with a finite number of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of asymmetric nuclear matter and its response to a static perturbation using the density functional theory framework. Our method, which extends the finite-nucleon-number technique of arXiv:2211.07986 to the case of isospin-asymmetric matter, allows to study the impact of external isoscalar and isovector fields on the system. In particular, the densities and static response functions in the different isospin channels, and as a function of isospin asymmetry, are evaluated. Finite-size effects are discussed by comparing with Random Phase Approximation predictions in the thermodynamic limit. A peculiar non-monotonic behavior of the isovector response function is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven High-Precision Model for $\alpha$-Decay Energy and Half-Life Prediction of superheavy nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) framework optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, we investigated the {\alpha}-decay energy and half-life of superheavy nuclei. By incorporating key nuclear structural features-including mass number, proton-to-neutron ratio, magic number proximity, and angular momentum transfer-the optimized model captures essential physical mechanisms governing $\alpha$-decay. On the test set, the model achieves significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) compared to empirical models such as Royer and Budaca, particularly in the low-energy region. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis confirms these mechanisms are dominated by decay energy, angular momentum barriers, and shell effects. This work establishes a physically consistent, data-driven tool for nuclear property prediction and offers valuable insights into $\alpha$-decay processes from a machine learning perspective.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear analysis of causality for heat flow in heavy-ion collisions: constraints from equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the causal parameter space of the Mueller-Israel-Stewart second-order theory for heat-conducting fluids in nonlinear regimes for one-dimensional fluid flow. We show that this parameter space is highly constrained and particularly sensitive to the equation of state and second-order transport coefficients. Through numerical analysis of the characteristic equations, we identify regions of strong hyperbolicity, weak hyperbolicity, and non-hyperbolicity, mapping the boundaries of causality violation as functions of the heat flux to energy density ratio $q/\varepsilon$ and relaxation parameters. We also explore the causality conditions using a realistic lattice QCD-based equation of state. Using the Navier-Stokes approximation, we estimate the heat flow magnitude to assess causality criteria for one-dimensional heat conduction in heavy-ion collisions. Our calculations reveal unrealistically large heat flux values ($|{\bf{q}}|/\varepsilon \sim 330-811$) for typical RHIC conditions when using thermal conductivity estimates from kinetic theory models, suggesting either significant overestimation of transport coefficients or breakdown of the fluid approximation in these extreme conditions. The pressure gradient corrections reduce the heat flow by approximately 15\% but do not resolve the causality concerns.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei with neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei are the most straightforward extension of atomic nuclei. A thorough description of baryonic system beyond first-generation quark sector is indispensable for the maturation of nuclear $ab$ $initio$ methods. This study pioneers the application of neural-network quantum states to hypernuclei, with trainable parameters determined by variational Monte Carlo approach (VMC-NQS). In order to reduce the numerical uncertainty and treat the nucleons and hyperons in a unified manner, spinor grouping (SG) method is proposed to analytically integrate out isospin degrees of freedom. A novel spin purification scheme is developed to address the severe spin contamination occurring in standard energy minimization due to the weakly bound characteristic of light single-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei. The energy spectrum of $s$-shell hypernuclei is computed with one-thousandth level accuracy and benchmarked against existing stochastic variational results, showing superior performance. By comparing two different sets of Hamiltonian based on pionless effective field theory (pionless EFT), we choose an optimal model and further carry out calculations of selected $p$-shell charge-symmetric hypernuclei with mass number up to 13, exhibiting satisfactory consistency with experimental results. Our findings underscore the potential of VMC-NQS family in approaching exact solution of few-body systems and the accuracy of pionless EFT in modeling hypernuclei. This is crucial for understanding hyperon-nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon-nucleon interactions, providing a powerful tool for precisely predicting the properties of multi-strangeness hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Second-order renormalized Hamiltonian of Yukawa theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP) we calculate the effective Hamiltonians in the theory of a fermion field coupled to a scalar field via the Yukawa interaction. The theory is renormalized by the addition of counterterms. Necessary counterterms are determined by computing matrix elements of the effective Hamiltonian. All calculations are performed up to the second order in the expansion in powers of the coupling constant. Renormalized effective Hamiltonians are well-defined symmetric operators acting in the Fock space as opposed to the renormalized bare Hamiltonian, which is not well-defined without regularization. We introduce computational techniques that should streamline higher-order calculations and may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lattice results for the equation of state in dense QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Probing non-perturbative QCD aspects on particle production in pp collisions with forward-backward correlations using \texttt{PYTHIA8}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ PYTHIA8 simulations to study forward-backward (FB) correlations in pp collisions at LHC energies, probing non-perturbative QCD dynamics via color reconnection (CR) and QCD radiation (ISR/FSR). Using \texttt{PYTHIA8} (v8.311) under ALICE/ATLAS kinematics, we analyze: extensive: FB multiplicity ($b_{\rm corr}^{\rm mult}$) and summed $p_{\rm T}$ ($b_{\rm corr}^{\sum p_{\rm T}}$) correlations; intensive: FB mean $p_{\rm T}$ ($b_{\rm corr}^{\overline p_{\rm T}}$) correlations; and \textit{strongly intensive:} $\Sigma_{\rm N_F N_B}$ quantity in symmetric pseudorapidity intervals, validated against available experimental data. Systematic studies of $b_{\rm corr}^{\rm mult}$ as functions of $\eta_{\rm gap}$, $\eta_{\rm sep}$, and $\eta$-$\varphi$ sectors show MPI-based CR (ranges 3.6, 5.4) and QCD Color Rope significantly improve agreement with data. ISR/FSR critically influence $b_{\rm corr}^{\rm mult}$ and $b_{\rm corr}^{\sum p_{\rm T}}$, with ISR dominant than FSR. Disabling ISR/FSR fails to replicate $\eta_{\rm gap}$-dependent trends. Further, $b_{\rm corr}^{\sum p_{\rm T}}$ shows minimal CR-range sensitivity but the correlation strength increases when CR is disabled. Intensive quantity, $b_{\rm corr}^{\overline p_{\rm T}}$, exhibit the opposite behavior to extensive observables i.e. the magnitude of $b_{\rm corr}^{\overline p_{\rm T}}$ increases with the increase of CR strength, highlighting the distinct influence of CR on intensive versus extensive observables. Its azimuthal dependence indicates that parton showers drive short-range correlations. The analysis of the strongly intensive quantity as a function of pseudorapidity gap indicates that FSR plays a dominant role at larger gaps, in contrast to the behavior observed in FB multiplicity correlations.</description>

Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Hyperon spin correlation in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental data show an unexpectedly large spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, which can be explained by short-distance fluctuations of strong force fields (vector $\phi$ fields) within the constituent-quark model. We calculate the hyperon spin correlations within the same model, taking into account hydrodynamic effects and a $\phi$ field fluctuating in space-time according to a Gaussian distribution. The $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ spin correlation induced by the $\phi$ field is shown to be negative as opposed to that of $\Lambda\Lambda$ or $\bar{\Lambda}\bar{\Lambda}$. We thus propose a new net spin correlation as a sensitive probe to separate strong force effects from hydrodynamic ones. With the strength of the field fluctuations extracted from the observed $\phi$ spin alignment, we predict the collision energy dependence of the hyperon spin correlations and also investigate the dependence of net spin correlation on azimuthal-angle and rapidity difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuations of the net-baryon number near the critical point of the liquid-gas phase transition. We use the parity doublet model in the mean-field approximation fixed to the zero-temperature properties of nuclear matter to account for critical behavior. We explicitly calculate the fluctuations of the net-proton and net-neutron numbers as well as their correlations in the isospin-symmetric matter. We focus on the qualitative properties and systematics of the first- to fourth-order susceptibilities and their ratios. We demonstrate that the fluctuations of net-proton number do not reflect the total net-baryon number fluctuations in the vicinity of the nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. We also study the behavior of the baryon and proton number factorial cumulants. We highlight the importance of the non-trivial correlations between protons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Evolution of shell structure at $\mathbf{N=32}$ and 34: Insights from realistic nuclear forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the evolution of shell structure at $N=32$ and 34 in neutron-rich nuclei beyond the stability line using realistic nuclear forces, employing the state-of-the-art valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group method. The shell gaps are discussed from the excitation energies of the first $2^+$ states and the evolution of effective single-particle energies. We addressed different components of the nuclear interaction--central, spin-orbit, and tensor--and their roles in the development of shell gaps far from stability. The calculated results align well with the available experimental data and suggest a strengthening of the $N=34$ subshell gap and a weakening of the $N=32$ subshell gap below Ca. Additionally, the low-energy structures of the exotic $N=32$ isotones below Ca revealed that their ground states exhibit large deformation and coexist with a weakly deformed band at low excitation energy. The present work demonstrates essential components of the nuclear force in shaping magic numbers far from stability and provides deeper insights into the structure of exotic nuclei from the underlying nuclear forces.</description>

      <title>Rescattering effects on spin-interference for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements by various experiments in ultra-peripheral collisions have observed spin-interference in $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction, marking a breakthrough in Fermi-scale quantum interference experiments. Building on this, STAR extended the measurement to hadronic heavy-ion collisions, where significant rescattering effects on $\rho^{0}$ mesons were expected. In this study, we investigate how these rescattering effects influence the measurement of spin-interference. By embedding $\rho^{0}$ mesons produced via photoproduction, modeled by the Vector Meson Dominance model, into the Ultrarelativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics framework, we estimate the impact on the $\cos2\phi$ and $\cos4\phi$ modulations, where $\phi$ is the angle between $\rho^{0}$ and one of the daughters' ($\pi^{\pm}$) transverse momentum. The results indicate a significant suppression of the $\cos2\phi$ modulation, while the $\cos4\phi$ modulation remains largely unaffected, which provides insight for understanding the difference due to rescattering effects between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for $\rho^{0}$ photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Quartet correlations near the surface of $ N = Z $ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate Cooper quartet correlations in $ N = Z $ doubly-magic nuclei ($ {}^{40} \mathrm{Ca} $, $ {}^{100} \mathrm{Sn} $, and $ {}^{164} \mathrm{Pb} $). We first examine the quartet condensation fraction in infinite symmetric nuclear matter by using the quartet Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. Together with the total nucleon density profiles of doubly-magic nuclei obtained from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock calculation, we discuss the spatial distribution of quartet correlations in finite nuclei within the local density approximation. Large quartet condensate fractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the strong neutron-proton attractive interaction responsible for the deuteron formation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the Wigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric nuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is numerically estimated to be about one order of magnitude of the total empirical strength, indicating the importance of multinucleon clusters in the symmetry energy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.</description>

      <title>From Nuclear Matter with Quenched $g_A$ to Compact-Star Matter with a Signal for Emergent Hidden Scale Symmetry</title>

Abstract: An ``unorthodox" idea is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be interpreted in terms of an emerging hidden scale symmetry in dense compact-star matter. Arguments are presented using an effective field theory anchored on a renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface coupled with hidden symmetric heavy mesonic degrees of freedom that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's nuclear effective field theory involving nucleon and pion fields only, referred hereon to as $\chi$EFT$_\pi$. Both hidden local and scale symmetries, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ (i.e., $f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity HQC)" is brought in via the skyrmion structure of the nucleon argued to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit and the large $N^\prime$ limit of the Grassmannian model $G/H= [O(N^\prime)/O(N^\prime-p) \times O(p)]$ where $N^\prime=4$ and $p=2$ for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry. The connection between the quenched $g_A$ and the sound speed $v^2_{s}/c^2\approx 1/3$ inside dense compact stars could be interpreted as a signal for emergent ``pseudo-conformal" symmetry.</description>

      <title>Comment on "QCD factorization with multihadron fragmentation functions"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make several comments on the recent work in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} while also reaffirming and adding to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. We show that the factorization formula for $e^+e^-\to (h_1\cdots h_n)\, X$ in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} is equivalent to a version one can derive using the definition of a $n$-hadron fragmentation function (FF) introduced in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. In addition, we scrutinize how to generalize the number density definition of a single-hadron FF to a $n$-hadron FF, arguing that the definition given in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} should be considered the standard one. We also emphasize that the evolution equations for dihadron FFs~(DiFFs) in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have the same splitting functions as those for single-hadron FFs. Therefore, the DiFF (and $n$-hadron FF) definitions in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx} have a natural number density interpretation and are consistent with collinear factorization using the standard hard factors and evolution kernels. Moreover, we make clear that the operator definition for the DiFF $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ written down in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb} agrees exactly with the one in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. Contrary to what is implied in Ref.~\cite{Rogers:2024nhb}, this definition did not appear in the literature prior to the work in Ref.~\cite{Pitonyak:2023gjx}. There also seem to be inconsistencies in how $D_1^{h_1h_2}(\xi,M_h)$ appears in previous unpolarized cross section formulas in the literature.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>High-precision Penning trap mass measurements of neutron-rich chlorine isotopes at the N=28 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is known that the $N=28$ spherical shell closure erodes, the strength of the closure with decreasing proton number $Z&lt;20$ is an open question in nuclear structure. In this region of interest, direct high-precision mass measurements of neutron-rich $^{43-45}$Cl isotopes were performed at the Low Energy Beam and Ion Trap (LEBIT) when coupled to the National Superconducting Cyclotron Lab. The resulting mass excesses (MEs) are ME($^{43}$Cl) = -24114.4(1.7) keV, ME($^{44}$Cl) = -20450.8(10.6) keV, and ME($^{45}$Cl) = -18240.1(3.7) keV, and improve the uncertainty of these masses by up to a factor of ~40 compared to the previous values reported in the 2020 Atomic Mass Evaluation. Comparison to $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations using the Valence-Space In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (VS-IMSRG) shows good agreement up to and including the closure.</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>
