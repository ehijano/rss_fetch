      <title>On the perimeter, diameter and circumradius of ordinary hyperbolic reduced polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A convex body $R$ in the hyperbolic plane is reduced if any convex body $K\subset R$ has a smaller minimal width than $R$. We answer a few of Lassak's questions about ordinary reduced polygons regarding its perimeter, diameter and circumradius, and we also obtain a hyperbolic extension of a result of Fabi\'nska.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial approach to nonlinear spectral gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A seminal open question of Pisier and Mendel--Naor asks whether every degree-regular graph which satisfies the classical discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for scalar functions, also satisfies an analogous inequality for functions taking values in any normed space with non-trivial cotype. Motivated by applications, it is also greatly important to quantify the dependence of the corresponding optimal Poincar\'{e} constant on the cotype $q$. Works of Odell--Schlumprecht (1994), Ozawa (2004), and Naor (2014) make substantial progress on the former question by providing a positive answer for normed spaces which also have an unconditional basis, in addition to finite cotype. However, little is known in the way of quantitative estimates: the mentioned results imply a bound on the Poincar\'{e} constant depending super-exponentially on $q$.
  We introduce a novel combinatorial framework for proving quantitative nonlinear spectral gap estimates. The centerpiece is a property of regular graphs that we call long range expansion, which holds with high probability for random regular graphs. Our main result is that any regular graph with the long-range expansion property satisfies a discrete Poincar\'{e} inequality for any normed space with an unconditional basis and cotype $q$, with a Poincar\'{e} constant that depends polynomially on $q$, which is optimal. As an application, any normed space which admits a low distortion embedding of an $n$-vertex random regular graph, must have cotype at least polylogarithmic in $n$. This extends a celebrated lower-bound of Matou\v{s}ek for low distortion embeddings of random graphs into $\ell_q$ spaces.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Gr\"unbaum's Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gr\"unbaum's inequality gives sharp bounds between the volume of a convex body and its part cut off by a hyperplane through the centroid of the body. We provide a generalization of this inequality for hyperplanes that do not necessarily contain the centroid. As an application, we obtain a sharp inequality that compares sections of a convex body to the maximal section parallel to it.</description>

      <title>A New Linear Programming Method in Sphere Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the linear programming method developed by Cohn and Elkies (Ann. Math. 157(2): 689-714, 2003), we introduce a new linear programming method to solve the sphere packing problem. More concretely, we consider sequences of auxiliary functions $\{g_m\}_{m\in \mathbb{N}^{+}}$, where $g_m$ is a $m\Lambda$-periodic auxiliary function defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $\Lambda$ being a given full-rank lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This new method extends the original approach and offers a greater flexibility. Furthermore, using this new linear programming framework, we construct several effective auxiliary functions for dimensions $n=1,2,3$. We hope this approach provides valuable insights into solving sphere packing problems for $n=2,3$ and even higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stability of the heat flow under convergence in concentration and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend to the framework of convergence in concentration virtually all the results concerning stability of Sobolev functions and differential operators known to be in place under the stronger measured-Gromov-Hausdorff convergence. These include, in particular:
  i) A general $\Gamma$--$\varlimsup$ inequality for the Cheeger energy,
  ii) Convergence of the heat flow under a uniform ${\sf CD}(K,\infty)$ condition on the spaces.
  As we will show, building on ideas developed for mGH-convergence, out of this latter result we can obtain clean stability statements for differential, flows of vector fields, Hessian, eigenvalues of the Laplacian and related objects in presence of uniform lower Ricci bounds. At the technical level, one of the tools we develop to establish these results is the notion of convergence of maps between metric measure spaces converging in concentration. Previous results in the field concerned the stability of the ${\sf CD}$ (Funano-Shioya '13) and ${\sf RCD}$ (Ozawa-Yokota '19) conditions. The latter was obtained proving $\Gamma$-convergence for the Cheeger energies. This is not sufficient to pass to the limit in the heat flow; one of the byproducts of our work is the improvement of this to Mosco-convergence.</description>

      <title>Gap phenomena under curvature restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper we discuss gap phenomena of three different types related to Ricci (and sectional) curvature. The first type is about spectral gaps. The second type is about sharp gap metric-rigidity, originally due to Anderson. The third is about sharp gap topological-rigidity. We also propose open problems along these directions.</description>

      <title>A note on faces of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The faces of a convex set owe their relevance to an interplay between convexity and topology that is systematically studied in the work of Rockafellar. Infinite-dimensional convex sets are excluded from this theory as their relative interiors may be empty. Shirokov and the present author answered this issue by proving that every point in a convex set lies in the relative algebraic interior of the face it generates. This theorem is proved here in a simpler way, connecting ideas scattered throughout the literature. This article summarizes and develops methods for faces and their relative algebraic interiors and applies them to spaces of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Synthetic versus distributional lower Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two standard approaches to defining lower Ricci curvature bounds for Riemannian metrics of regularity below $C^2$. These are, on the one hand, the synthetic definition via weak displacement convexity of entropy functionals in the framework of optimal transport, and the distributional one based on non-negativity of the Ricci-tensor in the sense of Schwartz. It turns out that distributional bounds imply entropy bounds for metrics of class $C^1$ and that the converse holds for $C^{1,1}$-metrics under an additional convergence condition on regularisations of the metric.</description>

      <title>Weighted Brunn-Minkowski Theory II: Inequalities for Mixed Measures and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In "Weighted Brunn-Minkowski Theory I", the prequel to this work, we discussed how recent developments on concavity of measures have laid the foundations of a nascent weighted Brunn-Minkowski theory. In particular, we defined the mixed measures of three convex bodies and obtained its integral representation. In this work, we obtain inequalities for mixed measures, such as a generalization of Fenchel's inequality; this provides a new, simpler proof of the classical volume case. Moreover, we show that mixed measures are connected to the study of log-submodularity and supermodularity of the measure of Minkowski sums of convex bodies. This elaborates on the recent investigations of these properties for the Lebesgue measure. We conclude by establishing that the only Radon measures that are supermodular over the class of compact, convex sets are multiples of the Lebesgue measure. Motivated by this result, we then discuss weaker forms of supermodularity by restricting the class of convex sets.</description>

      <title>Topological rigidity of small RCD(K,N) spaces with maximal rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a polycyclic group $\Lambda$, $\text{rank} ( \Lambda )$ is defined as the number of $\mathbb{Z}$ factors in a polycyclic decomposition of $\Lambda$. For a finitely generated group $G$, $\text{rank} (G)$ is defined as the infimum of $ \text{rank} (\Lambda )$ among finite index polycyclic subgroups $\Lambda \leq G$. For a compact $\text{RCD} (K,N)$ space $(X,\mathsf{d}, \mathfrak{m})$ with $\text{diam} (X) \leq \varepsilon (K,N)$, the rank of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most $N$. In this note we show that in case of equality, $X$ is homeomorphic to an infranilmanifold, generalizing to the non-smooth setting a result by Kapovitch--Wilking. We also fill a gap in the proof that if $\pi_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}^N$, then $X$ is bi-H\"older homeomorphic to a flat torus (diffeomorphic in the smooth case).</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the 4-dimensional Space with a Set of 4 Polyhypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Greenfeld and Tao disprove the conjecture that translational tilings of a single tile can always be periodic [Ann. Math. 200(2024), 301-363]. In another paper [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc.], they also show that if the dimension $n$ is part of the input, the translational tiling for subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with one tile is undecidable. These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for the conjecture that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper shows that translational tiling of the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $5$ polycubes is undecidable. By introducing a technique that lifts a set of polycubes and its tiling from $3$-dimensional space to $4$-dimensional space, we manage to show that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional space with a set of $4$ tiles is undecidable. This is a step towards the attempt to settle the conjecture of the undecidability of translational tiling of the $n$-dimensional space with a monotile, for some fixed $n$.</description>
