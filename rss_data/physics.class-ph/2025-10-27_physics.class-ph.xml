      <title>Exact formulation of Huygens' principle in terms of generalized spatiotemporal-dipole secondary sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A "spatiotemporal dipole" wave source, as defined by D.A.B. Miller (1991), differs from an ordinary ("spatial") dipole source in that the inverted monopole is delayed relative to the uninverted monopole, the delay being equal to the propagation time from one monopole to the other. A "generalized" spatiotemporal dipole (GSTD), as defined here, is generalized in two ways: first, the delay may be smaller in absolute value (but not larger) than the propagation time, so that the radiated waves cancel at a certain angle from the axis of the dipole; second, one monopole may be attenuated relative to the other, so that the cancellation is exact at a finite distance - on a circle coaxial with the dipole.
  I show that the Kirchhoff integral theorem, for a single monopole primary source, gives the same wave function as a certain distribution of GSTD secondary sources on the surface of integration. In the GSTDs, the "generalized" delay allows the surface of integration to be general (not necessarily a primary wavefront), whereas the attenuation allows an exact match of the wave function even in the near field of the primary source. At each point on the surface of integration, the circle of cancellation of the GSTD secondary source passes through the primary source, which therefore receives no backward secondary waves, while the direction of specular reflection of the primary wave passes through the same circle, giving a geometrical-optical explanation of the suppression of backward secondary waves at any field point.</description>

      <title>Lattice-induced sound trapping in biperiodic metasurfaces of acoustic resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A referential example of a physical system that supports bound states in the continuum (BICs) with an infinite quality factor ($Q$-factor) is a subwavelength lattice of discrete scatterers (resonators) whose response can be significantly modified by exploiting lattice interactions. In this work, we explore the multipole interference mechanism for realizing accidental acoustic BICs (trapped modes) at the $\Gamma$-point (in-plane Bloch wave vector $\mathbf{k}_{\parallel} = \mathbf{0}$) in biperiodic lattices of acoustic resonators with one resonator per unit cell. To do so, we expand the pressure field from the lattice into a series of scalar zonal ($m = 0$) spherical multipoles, carried by a normally incident plane wave, and formulate analytical conditions on the resonator's multipole moments under which an eigenmode becomes a BIC. The conditions allow us to determine the lattice constant and frequency values that enable the formation of the axisymmetric BIC due to the destructive interference of radiation from zonal multipole moments of a certain parity, although each moment radiates individually. By employing the T-matrix method for acoustic metasurfaces, we numerically investigate the BIC resonance in various structures, including finite arrays, and also the transformation of such resonances into high-$Q$ quasi-BIC regimes, which can be excited by a plane wave at normal incidence.</description>
