      <title>Toward an usage of americium-241 for filter calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nuclear safety and environmental studies, it is necessary to measure the activity of aerosols collected on filters. The calibration of these filters' measurement chains currently involves producing a reference filter with a controlled deposit of aerosol marked by a specific radionuclide. In France, commonly used radionuclides include 137 Cs for gamma or beta emitters, 90 Sr/ 90 Y for beta emitters, and 239 Pu for alpha emitters. However, using 239 Pu presents several issues, notably the destruction of the filter required to determine its traceable activity and the associated uncertainties. The challenge of this project is to propose a radionuclide enabling non-destructive, SI-traceable measurement while retaining the reference filter. The proposed radionuclide is 241 Am, which is both alpha and gamma-emitting and allows for precise non-destructive measurements. Reference filters are produced on the IRSN's ICARE test bench with calibrated aerosols tagged with 241 Am. The reference activity of theses filters is measured by gamma spectrometry on CEA/LNHB reference counter. A series of tests confirmed that 241 Am provides accurate activity determination with minimal uncertainty. Consequently, adopting 241 Am can significantly improve the reliability of radioactive contamination monitoring while avoiding practical challenges associated with plutonium.</description>

      <title>Source quantification by mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems: A Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying gamma-ray sources from mobile gamma-ray spectrometry surveys has remained a fundamentally elusive, long-standing inverse problem at the interface of nuclear and computational physics. Here, we present a full-spectrum Bayesian inference framework that resolves this inverse problem by combining high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo template generation with Bayesian inversion. Applying this methodology to airborne measurements benchmarked against laboratory and in-situ ground truths, we demonstrate accurate and robust quantification of both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides under field conditions. By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Design, simulation and performance of the resistive-anode PICOSEC Micromegas detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PICOSEC Micromegas detector is a Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector concept developed to achieve tens of picosecond timing resolution for charged particle detection by combining a Cherenkov radiator with a two-stage Micromegas amplification structure. To improve operational robustness, a resistive anode has been implemented using a DLC layer deposited on a Kapton substrate. While this design enhances detector stability, the resistive layer may influence rate capability, signal formation, and detector capacitance, altering timing performance.
  This work presents a comprehensive study of a resistive design, including an analytical model and finite-element simulations to quantify rate-dependent gain reduction due to ohmic voltage drop on the resistive layer. An analytical solution for the voltage across a finite-size resistive layer is derived, and a numerical model is developed to evaluate gain suppression under intense particle fluxes. The impact of the resistive layer on signal formation is investigated using time-dependent weighting fields and the Garfield++ simulation framework. The contribution of signal components induced by the resistive layer is quantified, and preservation of the signal leading edge is found for surface resistivities above 100 kohm per square.
  Single-channel resistive-anode prototypes were designed, constructed, and experimentally characterized. Laboratory measurements using single photoelectrons and power spectral density analysis show the predicted reduction in signal amplitude while preserving the leading edge. Muon beam tests with CsI and DLC photocathodes demonstrate a time resolution of 11.5 ps for CsI, comparable to 11.9 ps for the metallic-anode device, showing the suitability of the resistive design for precision timing applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal operating parameters for next-generation xenon gas time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) searches are targeting half-life sensitivities towards 10$^{27}$--10$^{28}$ years. Gaseous xenon time projection chamber (GXeTPC) detectors are a technology that may be able to meet this challenge due to their excellent background rejection power, scalability, and energy resolution. This paper explores how the design choices of a next-generation GXeTPC time projection chamber can impact the overall performance of the experiment. We study the performance of systems using xenon enriched in the isotope $^{136}$Xe or natural xenon, focusing on scenarios that incorporate one tonne of source isotope. The detector size, copper shielding mass, energy resolution, pressure, and diffusion amount are surveyed to evaluate the overall performance dependencies on these parameters. A detector optimized for using enriched xenon is preferred, with a factor of 10 lower background rate, driven by the large intrinsic backgrounds introduced by the copper shielding used in the detector. The performance of three types of gas TPC technologies was also explored based on different gas additives used to reduce diffusion to different levels. For all TPC technologies, we find background rates of a fraction of a count per tonne year in the region of interest are achievable. These performances are contingent on suitable energy resolution and event position placement in the drift direction being achieved for the specific detector technology. When factoring in the considerations for the construction of the detector in addition to the selection performance, there is no clear optimum pressure, with advantages and disadvantages if a high or low pressure default configuration is chosen.</description>

      <title>Talking with a ghost: semi-virtual coupled levitated oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscopic particles levitated by optical, electrical or magnetic fields act as mechanical oscillators with a range of surprising properties, such as tuneable oscillation frequencies, access to rotational motion, and remarkable quality factors. Coupled levitated particles display rich dynamics and non-reciprocal interactions, with applications in sensing and the exploration of non-equilibrium and quantum physics. In this work, we present a single levitated particle displaying coupled-oscillator dynamics by generating an interaction with a virtual or ``ghost'' particle. This ghost levitated particle is simulated on an analogue computer, and hence its prperties can be dynamically varied. Our work represents a new angle on measurement-based bath engineering and physical simulation, and in the future could lead to the generation of novel cooling mechanisms and complex physical simulation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high precision high voltage system for PTOLEMY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PTOLEMY project is prototyping a novel electromagnetic filter for high-precision $\beta$ spectroscopy, with the ultimate and ambitious long-term goal of detecting the cosmic neutrino background through electron capture on tritium bound to graphene. Intermediate small-scale prototypes can achieve competitive sensitivity to the effective neutrino mass, even with reduced energy resolution. To reach an energy resolution better than \SI{500}{meV} at the tritium $\beta$-spectrum endpoint of \SI{18.6}{keV}, and accounting for all uncertainties in the filtering chain, the electrode voltage must be controlled at the level of a few parts per million and monitored in real time. In this work, we present the first results obtained in this effort, using a chain of commercial ultra-high-precision voltage references, read out by precision multimeters and a \emph{field mill} device. The currently available precision on high voltage is, in the conservative case, as low as \SI{0.2}{ppm} per \SI{1}{kV} single board and $\lesssim$ \SI{50}{mV} over the \SI{10}{kV} series, presently limited by field mill read-out noise. However, assuming uncorrelated Gaussian noise extrapolation, the real precision could in principle be as low as \SI{0.05}{ppm} over \SI{20}{kV}.</description>

      <title>Time-domain anode-decoupling co-design for a floating MCP TOF-MS readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microchannel plate detector for compact time-of-flight mass spectrometers (TOF-MS) that jointly optimizes the anode geometry and high-voltage AC-decoupling network for electrically floating operation. Undershoot-driven baseline artifacts and pulse broadening are addressed by a time-domain co-design of the anode geometry and decoupling network. The design is validated through a staged workflow that combines full-wave electromagnetic simulations, vector network analyzer measurements, circuit-level transient models, and end-to-end mass spectra. The resulting planar circular patch anode with anode-proximal decoupling confines fields, preserves peak amplitude, and suppresses post-pulse energy, leading to fast settling and minimal baseline wander. We show that the effective high-pass corner set by the decoupling capacitance directly governs undershoot decay and baseline recovery. Measurements in a representative TOF-MS test setup demonstrate waveguide-level pulse fidelity at a fraction of the mass and volume of heritage waveguide-based detectors, with residual ripples in the measured response originating from downstream cable and digitizer terminations rather than the detector itself. By limiting detector-induced temporal broadening and inter-peak baseline coupling, the design supports high mass resolution and dynamic range in miniaturized TOF-MS architectures. Variants of this planar flight-ready architecture are being implemented in several next-generation spaceborne TOF-MS instruments currently under development at the University of Bern.</description>

      <title>Picosecond laser test unit for photosensor characterization at ambient and low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate single photoelectron (SPE) characterization of photosensors is essential for controlling systematic uncertainties in low-light neutrino and dark matter detectors. We present a compact laboratory setup for the characterization of photosensors under controlled, low-light conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate its use with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) operated at the SPE-level, using picosecond laser pulses and waveform digitization to determine key PMT properties. Measurements as a function of supply voltage and temperature ($-50^\circ$C to $+20^\circ$C) are performed on ET Enterprises 9821(Q)B tubes and a Hamamatsu R9980 assembly, which show exponential gain-voltage behavior and device-to-device variation. Cooling increases the gain by $\sim 0.1\,\%/^\circ$C, while the transit time spread (TTS) and peak-to-valley ratio (P/V) exhibit no clear temperature dependence. TTS decreases with voltage. Late pulses remain at the percent level and prepulses at the sub-percent level. Cable length affects both apparent gain and TTS. A model-independent, data-driven self-convolution method is introduced to quantify double photoelectron contributions from pulse charge spectra. The procedures provide a reproducible, practice-oriented reference for SPE-level PMT characterization and can be extended to other photosensor types.</description>

      <title>Robust and scalable simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.</description>

      <title>The Choice of Line Lengths in Multiline Thru-Reflect-Line Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and rigorous procedure for determining the optimal lengths of line standards in multiline thru-reflect-line (TRL) calibration of vector network analyzers (VNAs). The solution is obtained through nonlinear constrained optimization of the eigenvalue problem in multiline TRL calibration. Additionally, we propose a simplified approach for near-optimal length selection based on predefined sparse rulers. Alongside the length calculation, we discuss the required number of lines to meet bandwidth requirements. The sensitivity of the proposed procedure is evaluated numerically via Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that the derived lengths have lower uncertainty than those from existing industry standards. Practical examples are provided for various applications, including lossy and dispersive lines, as well as banded solutions for waveguides.</description>

      <title>Reactive near-field subwavelength microwave imaging with a non-invasive Rydberg probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive microwave field imaging--accurately mapping field distributions without perturbing them--is essential in areas such as aerospace engineering, biomedical imaging and integrated-circuit diagnostics. Conventional metal probes, however, inevitably perturb reactive near fields: they act as strong scatterers that drive induced currents and secondary radiation, remap evanescent components and thereby degrade both accuracy and spatial resolution, particularly in the reactive near-field regime that is most relevant to these applications. Here we demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, reactive near-field subwavelength imaging of microwave fields using the quantum non-demolition properties of Rydberg atoms, realized with a compact, non-invasive single-ended fibre-integrated Rydberg probe engineered to minimize field disturbance. The probe achieves an imaging resolution of {\unboldmath$\lambda/56$}, and the measured field distributions agree with full-wave simulations with structural similarity approaching unity, confirming both its subwavelength spatial resolution and its genuinely non-invasive character compared with conventional metal-based probes. Because the atomic sensor is intrinsically isotropic, the same device can faithfully image multi-dimensional field structures without orientation-dependent calibration. Our results therefore establish a general, non-invasive route to high-accuracy, subwavelength reactive near-field microwave imaging, with particular promise for applications such as chip-defect detection and integrated-circuit diagnostics, where even small perturbations by the probe can mask the underlying physics of interest.</description>

Abstract: We report on the design, operation, and performance of a novel proximity-focusing Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector equipped with a multilayer focusing aerogel radiator, developed for the forward region of the Belle II spectrometer at the SuperKEKB $e^+e^-$ collider. The system achieves effective separation of charged pions, kaons, and protons across the full kinematic range of the experiment, from 0.5 GeV/c to 4 GeV/c. To date, the detector has successfully operated in data-taking, contributing to the collection and analysis of nearly 600/fb of Belle II $e^+e^-$  collision data.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Approach to Enhance Positron Tracking Performance in MEG II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a Transformer-based pattern recognition method for positron track reconstruction in the MEG II experiment. The model acts as a classifier to remove pileup hits in the MEG II drift chamber, which operates under a high pileup occupancy of 35 - 50 %. The trained model significantly improved hit purity, leading to enhancements in tracking efficiency and resolution by 15 % and 5 %, respectively, at a muon stopping rate of $5\times 10^7 \mu$/sec. This improvement translates into an approximately 10 % increase in the sensitivity of the $\mu\to e\gamma$ branching ratio measurement.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near-real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions. Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The methodology presented is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>

      <title>Optical characterization of wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20390v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of the environmental refractive index was studied by immersing the EJ-160II fiber in water. Immersing the fiber in water reduced the overall light output and suppressed the short attenuation component, which can be explained by reduced light-collection efficiency due to the smaller refractive-index contrast between the fiber cladding and the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>GRANITE: High-Resolution Imaging and Electrical Qualification of Large-Area TPC Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for comprehensive electrode quality assurance. The system is built around the GRANITE (Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes) facility: a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.</description>
