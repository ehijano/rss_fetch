      <title>A finite element framework for simulating residential burglary in realistic urban geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a partial differential equation (PDE) model to predict residential burglary derived from a probabilistic agent-based model through a mean-field limit operation. The PDE model is a nonlinear, coupled system of two equations in two variables (attractiveness of residential sites and density of criminals), similar to the Keller-Segel model for aggregation based on chemotaxis. Unlike previous works, which applied periodic boundary conditions, we enforce boundary conditions that arise naturally from the variational formulation of the PDE problem, i.e., the starting point for the application of a finite element method. These conditions specify the value of the normal derivatives of the system variables at the boundary. For the numerical solution of the PDE problem discretized in time and space, we propose a scheme that decouples the computation of the attractiveness from the computation of the criminal density at each time step, resulting in the solution of two linear algebraic systems per iteration. Through numerous numerical tests, we demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of this approach. Leveraging the flexibility allowed by the finite element method, we show results for spatially heterogeneous model parameters and a realistic geometry (city of Chicago). The paper includes a discussion of future perspectives to build multiscale, 'multi-physics' models that can become a tool for the community. The robust and efficient code developed for this paper, which is shared open-source, is intended as the solid base for this broader research program.</description>

      <title>Sharp Collocated Projection Method for Immiscible Two-Phase Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sharp collocated projection method for solving the immiscible, two-phase Navier-Stokes equations in two- and three-dimensions. Our method is built using non-graded adaptive quadtree and octree grids, where all of the fluid variables are defined on the nodes, and we leverage this framework to design novel spatial and temporal discretizations for the two-phase problem. The benefits of the nodal collocation framework are best exemplified through our novel discretizations, which employ a hybrid finite difference-finite volume methodology to treat the boundary and interfacial jump conditions in an entirely sharp manner. We demonstrate the capabilities of our novel approach using a variety of canonical two- and three-dimensional examples and outline how our framework can be extended to address more complicated physics. The overall algorithm achieves high accuracy with simplified data structures, making this solver ideal for scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Low-Rank Tensor Decompositions for Numerical Simulation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new low-dimensional model of high-dimensional numerical simulation data based on low-rank tensor decompositions. Our new model aims to minimize differences between the model data and simulation data as well as functions of the model data and functions of the simulation data. This novel approach to dimensionality reduction of simulation data provides a means of directly incorporating quantities of interests and invariants associated with conservation principles associated with the simulation data into the low-dimensional model, thus enabling more accurate analysis of the simulation without requiring access to the full set of high-dimensional data. Computational results of applying this approach to two standard low-rank tensor decompositions of data arising from simulation of combustion and plasma physics are presented.</description>

      <title>Two intriguing variants of the AAA algorithm for rational approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a rational function in barycentric form to approximate a given function or data set in $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. The famous AAA algorithm, introduced in 2018, constructs such a rational function: the barycentric weights are the entries of the final right singular vector of a Loewner matrix with more rows than columns. We present two variants of the AAA algorithm, inspired by two intriguing quotations from the original paper. In the first, which we call AAAsmooth, we take the barycentric weights to be a complex linear combination of the last two right singular vectors, which eliminates the problem of spurious poles in real-valued problems and yields smoother convergence curves. In the second, AAAbudget, we incorporate first derivative information. This allows us to use a smaller, square alternative to the Loewner matrix, so the SVDs are cheaper while the resulting approximant is similar to the result of standard AAA. We present numerical tests showing that while both variants behave fairly similarly to standard AAA, AAAsmooth can give somewhat better results and AAAbudget can be much faster.</description>

      <title>Fluid Dynamics and Domain Reconstruction from Noisy Flow Images Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Quasi-Conformal Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to assess the influence of key hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Polynomial preserving recovery for PHT-splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a polynomial preserving recovery method for PHT-splines within isogeometric analysis to obtain more accurate gradient approximations. The method fully exploits the local interpolation properties of PHT-splines and avoids the need for information on gradient superconvergent points. By leveraging the superconvergence argument of difference quotients and the interior error estimate, we establish the superconvergence property of the recovered gradient on translation invariant meshes. As a byproduct, a recovery-based a posteriori error estimator is developed for adaptive refinement. Numerical results confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>AirBreath Sensing: Protecting Over-the-Air Distributed Sensing Against Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A distinctive function of sixth-generation (6G) networks is the integration of distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent perception of the physical world. This resultant platform, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to enable a broad spectrum of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including remote surgery, autonomous driving, and holographic telepresence. Recently, the communication bottleneck confronting the implementation of an ISEA system is overcome by the development of over-the-air computing (AirComp) techniques, which facilitate simultaneous access through over-the-air data feature fusion. Despite its advantages, AirComp with uncoded transmission remains vulnerable to interference. To tackle this challenge, we propose AirBreath sensing, a spectrum-efficient framework that cascades feature compression and spread spectrum to mitigate interference without bandwidth expansion. This work reveals a fundamental tradeoff between these two operations under a fixed bandwidth constraint: increasing the compression ratio may reduce sensing accuracy but allows for more aggressive interference suppression via spread spectrum, and vice versa. This tradeoff is regulated by a key variable called breathing depth, defined as the feature subspace dimension that matches the processing gain in spread spectrum. To optimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and optimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for sensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG). Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing effectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force search.</description>

      <title>Combining Nonlinear FETI-DP Methods and Quasi-Newton Methods using an SQP Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of nonlinear FETI-DP (Dual Primal Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting) and Quasi-Newton methods using a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach is considered. Nonlinear FETI-DP methods are parallel iterative solution methods for nonlinear finite element problems, based on divide and conquer, using Lagrange multipliers. In the method, we use Quasi-Newton approximations of Hessian for the quadratic programs, where the initial approximation uses the exact Hessian. To accelerate the convergence, we recompute the initial Hessian and restart the Quasi-Newton approximation. We provide numerical experiments using homogeneous model problems from nonlinear structural mechanics.</description>

      <title>Virtual element method for thermomechanical analysis of electronic packaging structures with multi-scale features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents two approaches: the virtual element method (VEM) and the stabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) for analyzing thermomechanical behavior in electronic packaging structures with geometric multi-scale features. Since the virtual element method allows the use of arbitrary polygonal elements, the inherent mesh flexibility of VEM allows localized mesh modifications without affecting global mesh structure, making it particularly effective for the analysis of electronic packaging reliability involving complex geometries and multiple geometric scales. The approach implements a novel non-matching mesh generation strategy that strategically combines polygonal meshes for complex small-scale regions with regular quadrilateral meshes for larger domains. The VEM formulation addresses both heat conduction and thermomechanical coupling problems, with comprehensive verification through analytical benchmarks and practical electronic packaging case studies, including Through-Silicon Via (TSV), Ball Grid Array (BGA), and Plastic Ball Grid Array (PBGA) structures. Results demonstrate that the method accurately captures stress concentrations at material interfaces and provides reliable thermal and mechanical response predictions. Some MATLAB codes for the numerical examples are provided at https://github.com/yanpeng-gong/VEM-electronic-packaging and on the VEMhub website (www.vemhub.com).</description>

      <title>A Monotonicity-Based Regularization Approach to Shape Reconstruction for the Helmholtz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse boundary value problem for determining unknown scatterers, which is governed by the Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain. To address this, we develop a novel convex data-fitting formulation that is capable of reconstructing the shape of the unknown scatterers.Our formulation is based on a monotonicity relation between the scattering index and boundary measurements. We use this relation to obtain a pixel-wise constraint on the unknown scattering index, and then minimize a data-fitting functional defined as the sum of all positive eigenvalues of a linearized residual operator. The main advantages of our new approach are that this is a convex data-fitting problem that does not require additional PDE solutions. The global convergence and stability of the method are rigorously established to demonstrate the theoretical soundness. In addition, several numerical experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in shape reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Augmented Lagrangian Solvers for Poroelasticity with Fracture Contact Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the subsurface, fractures and the surrounding porous rock can deform in interaction with fluid flow. Advanced mathematical models governing these coupled processes typically combine fluid flow, poroelasticity, and fracture contact mechanics, representing fractures as co-dimension one objects within the porous medium. The resulting system of equations is complex and highly nonlinear. As a result, convergence issues with nonlinear solvers are common, which hinders the practical implementation of such models.
  One particular source of difficulty for the nonlinear solvers comes from the fracture contact mechanics, due to its inherently nonsmooth character. In this paper, we investigate solvers based on the augmented Lagrangian formulation of the frictional contact problem. This includes two classical solvers, namely the generalized Newton method (using complementarity functions) and the return map method. In addition, we propose a new augmented Lagrangian solver that combines the two approaches.
  Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to assess the performance of the solvers on problems of mixed-dimensional poromechanics with fracture contact mechanics. The experiments indicate that for simpler setups, the solvers behave quite predictably and in accordance with established heuristics from the contact mechanics literature. However, as the complexity of the problem increases, the solvers become more unpredictable, and break with these heuristics. In particular, the two classical solvers become highly sensitive to the augmentation parameter. The new solver converges across a larger range of this parameter in most cases, but nevertheless also displays unpredictable behavior.</description>

      <title>A multigrid method for CutFEM and its implementation on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multigrid method for an unfitted finite element discretization of the Dirichlet boundary value problem. The discretization employs Nitsche's method to implement the boundary condition and additional face based ghost penalties for stabilization. We apply standard intergrid operators, relying on the fact that the relevant domain of computation does not grow under mesh refinement. The smoother is a parallel implementation of the multiplicative vertex-patch smoother with inconsistent treatment of ghost penalties. Our computational results show that we obtain a fast converging method. Furthermore, runtime comparison to fitted methods show that the losses are moderate although many optimizations for Cartesian vertex patches cannot be applied on cut patches.</description>

      <title>SO-PIFRNN: Self-optimization physics-informed Fourier-features randomized neural network for solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a self-optimization physics-informed Fourier-features randomized neural network (SO-PIFRNN) framework, which significantly improves the numerical solving accuracy of PDEs through hyperparameter optimization mechanism. The framework employs a bi-level optimization architecture: the outer-level optimization utilizes a multi-strategy collaborated particle swarm optimization (MSC-PSO) algorithm to search for optimal hyperparameters of physics-informed Fourier-features randomized neural network, while the inner-level optimization determines the output layer weights of the neural network via the least squares method. The core innovation of this study is embodied in the following three aspects: First, the Fourier basis function activation mechanism is introduced in the hidden layer of neural network, which significantly enhances the ability of the network to capture multi-frequency components of the solution. Secondly, a novel derivative neural network method is proposed, which improves the calculation accuracy and efficiency of PIFRNN method. Finally, the MSC-PSO algorithm of the hybrid optimization strategy is designed to improve the global search ability and convergence accuracy through the synergistic effect of dynamic parameter adjustment, elitist and mutation strategies. Through a series of numerical experiments, including multiscale equations in complex regions, high-order equations, high-dimensional equations and nonlinear equations, the validity of SO-PIFRNN is verified. The experimental results affirm that SO-PIFRNN exhibits superior approximation accuracy and frequency capture capability.</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound is transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used for predicting beam aberration, assessing cranial heating, and correcting the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull tissue. We have shown that this approach is highly accurate on relatively coarse meshes compared to the minimum wavelength, enabling direct use of CT voxel data. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations with a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer show significant beam distortion and attenuation, with a focal shift of several millimeters from the homogeneous case.</description>

      <title>Nested Operator Inference for Adaptive Data-Driven Learning of Reduced-order Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven, nested Operator Inference (OpInf) approach for learning physics-informed reduced-order models (ROMs) from snapshot data of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The approach exploits the inherent hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time. Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Deep Learning Approach for Approximating Parameter-to-Solution Maps of PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider approximating the parameter-to-solution maps of parametric partial differential equations (PPDEs) using deep neural networks (DNNs). We propose an efficient approach combining reduced collocation methods (RCMs) and DNNs. In the approximation analysis section, we rigorously derive sharp upper bounds on the complexity of the neural networks. These bounds only depend on the reduced basis dimension rather than the high-fidelity discretization dimension, thereby theoretically guaranteeing the computational efficiency of our approach. In numerical experiments, we implement the RCM using radial basis function finite differences (RBF-FD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and propose the POD-DNN algorithm. We consider various types of PPDEs and compare the accuracy and efficiency of different solvers. The POD-DNN has demonstrated significantly accelerated inference speeds compared with conventional numerical methods owing to the offline-online computation strategy. Furthermore, by employing the reduced basis methods (RBMs), it also outperforms standard DNNs in computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Bias in Inverting Random Sampling Matrices with Application to Sub-sampled Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A substantial body of work in machine learning (ML) and randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) has exploited various sorts of random sketching methodologies, including random sampling and random projection, with much of the analysis using Johnson--Lindenstrauss and subspace embedding techniques. Recent studies have identified the issue of inversion bias -- the phenomenon that inverses of random sketches are not unbiased, despite the unbiasedness of the sketches themselves. This bias presents challenges for the use of random sketches in various ML pipelines, such as fast stochastic optimization, scalable statistical estimators, and distributed optimization. In the context of random projection, the inversion bias can be easily corrected for dense Gaussian projections (which are, however, too expensive for many applications). Recent work has shown how the inversion bias can be corrected for sparse sub-gaussian projections. In this paper, we show how the inversion bias can be corrected for random sampling methods, both uniform and non-uniform leverage-based, as well as for structured random projections, including those based on the Hadamard transform. Using these results, we establish problem-independent local convergence rates for sub-sampled Newton methods.</description>

      <title>Exponential Runge-Kutta methods of collocation type for parabolic equations with time-dependent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, exponential Runge-Kutta methods of collocation type (ERKC) which were originally proposed in (Appl Numer Math 53:323-339, 2005) are extended to semilinear parabolic problems with time-dependent delay. Two classes of the ERKC methods are constructed and their convergence properties are analyzed. It is shown that methods with $s$ arbitrary nonconfluent collocation parameters achieve convergence of order $s$. Provided that the collocation parameters fulfill some additional conditions and the solutions of the problems exhibit sufficient temporal and spatial smoothness, we derive superconvergence results. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and geometric locking-free finite element implementation of a refined shell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate finite element analysis of refined shell theories is crucial but often hindered by membrane and shear locking effects. While various element-based locking-free techniques exist, this work addresses the problem at the theoretical level by utilizing results from asymptotic analysis. A formulation of a 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear is developed using rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation, ensuring equal asymptotic orders of magnitude for extension, bending, and rotation measures and their respective stiffnesses. This novel approach, implemented via isogeometric analysis, is shown to be both asymptotically accurate relative to the underlying refined shell theory and inherently free from membrane and shear locking. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells show excellent agreement between the analytical solutions, 2D refined shell theory predictions, and 3D elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal finite element approximations of monotone semilinear elliptic PDE with subcritical nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study iterative finite element approximations for the numerical approximation of semilinear elliptic boundary value problems with monotone nonlinear reactions of subcritical growth. The focus of our contribution is on an optimal a priori error estimate for a contractive Picard type iteration scheme on meshes that are locally refined towards possible corner singularities in polygonal domains. Our analysis involves, in particular, an elliptic regularity result in weighted Sobolev spaces and the use of the Trudinger inequality, which is instrumental in dealing with subcritically growing nonlinearities. A series of numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based A Posteriori Error Analysis for Semi-explicit Index-1 and Hessenberg Index-2 Differential-Algebraic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we develop adjoint-based analyses for \textit{a posteriori} error estimation for the temporal discretization of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) of special type: semi-explicit index-1 and Hessenberg index-2. Our technique quantifies the error in a Quantity of Interest (QoI), which is defined as a bounded linear functional of the solution of a DAE. We derive representations for errors of various types of QoIs (depending on the entire time interval, final time, algebraic variables, differential variables, etc.). We develop two analyses: one that defines the adjoint to the DAE system, and one that first converts the DAE to an ODE system and then applies classical \textit{a posteriori} analysis techniques. A number of examples are presented, including nonlinear and non-autonomous DAEs, as well as spatially discretized partial differential-algebraic equations (PDAEs). Numerical results indicate a high degree of accuracy in the error estimation.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz boundary integral methods and the pollution effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems with large wavenumber $k$ and smooth obstacles using the standard second-kind boundary integral equations (BIEs) for these problems. We consider Galerkin and collocation methods - with subspaces consisting of $\textit{either}$ piecewise polynomials (in 2-d for collocation, in any dimension for Galerkin) $\textit{or}$ trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d) - as well as a fully discrete quadrature (a.k.a., Nystr\"om) method based on trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d).
  For each of these methods, we address the fundamental question: how quickly must $N$, the dimension of the approximation space, grow with $k$ to maintain accuracy as $k\to\infty$?
  For the methods involving piecewise-polynomials, we give sufficient conditions for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Galerkin method we show that these conditions are, in fact, necessary and sufficient. In particular we prove that the Galerkin method $\textit{suffers from the pollution effect}$; i.e., $N$ growing like $k^{d-1}$ is often not sufficient for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Dirichlet BIEs, pollution occurs when the obstacle is trapping - and we also give numerical experiments illustrating this - but for the Neumann BIEs pollution occurs even when the obstacle is a ball.
  For all the methods involving trigonometric polynomials, we show that, up to potential factors of $k^\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is no pollution (even for trapping obstacles).
  These are the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of collocation or Nystr\"om methods applied to the Dirichlet BIEs, the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of any method used to solve the standard second-kind Neumann BIEs, and the first results proving that a boundary integral method applied to the Helmholtz equation suffers from the pollution effect.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Attribute Localizing Models for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) focuses on identifying various attributes in pedestrian images, with key applications in person retrieval, suspect re-identification, and soft biometrics. However, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for PAR often suffer from over-parameterization and high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. Traditional tensor-based compression methods typically factorize layers without adequately preserving the gradient direction during compression, leading to inefficient compression and a significant accuracy loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach for determining the optimal ranks of low-rank layers, ensuring that the gradient direction of the compressed model closely aligns with that of the original model. This means that the compressed model effectively preserves the update direction of the full model, enabling more efficient compression for PAR tasks. The proposed procedure optimizes the compression ranks for each layer within the ALM model, followed by compression using CPD-EPC or truncated SVD. This results in a reduction in model complexity while maintaining high performance.</description>
