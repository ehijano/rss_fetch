      <title>Type II t-J model in charge transfer regime in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of an 80 K superconductor in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure have attracted significant attention. Recent experiments indicate that La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may be in the charge transfer regime, challenging the previous models based purely on the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. In this study, we propose a low energy model that incorporates doped holes in the oxygen $p$ orbitals. Given that the parent nickel state is in the $3d^{8}$ configuration with a spin-one moment, doped hole only screens it down to spin-half, in contrast to the Zhang-Rice singlet in cuprate. We dub the single hole state as Zhang-Rice spin-half and build an effective model which includes three spin-one states ($d^8$) and two Zhang-Rice spin-half states ($d^8 L$). At moderate pressure around $20$ GPa, the dominated oxygen orbital is an in-plane Wannier orbital with the same lattice symmetry as the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. The resulting model reduces to the bilayer type II t-J model previously proposed in the Mott-Hubbard regime. Notably, the hopping between the in-plane $p$ orbitals of the two layers is still suppressed. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation reveals a pairing dome with the optimal hole doping level at $x=0.4\sim0.5$, distinct from the hole doped cuprate where optimal doping occurs around $x=0.19$. Further increasing pressure initially raises the critical temperature ($T_c$) until reaching an optimal pressure beyond which the $p_z$ orbital of oxygen becomes favorable and superconductivity is diminished. This shift from in-plane $p$ orbital to $p_z$ orbital may elucidate the experimentally observed superconducting dome with varying pressure. As an extension, we also suggest a trilayer version of the type II t-J model as the minimal model for pressured La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, which is distinct from the models in the Mott-Hubbard regime.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions of symmetric isotropic spin clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin models like the Heisenberg Hamiltonian effectively describe the interactions of open-shell transition-metal ions on a lattice and can account for various properties of magnetic solids and molecules. Numerical methods are usually required to find exact or approximate eigenstates, but for small clusters with spatial symmetry, analytical solutions exist, and a few Heisenberg systems have been solved in closed form. This paper presents a simple, generally applicable approach to analytically solve isotropic spin clusters, based on adapting the basis to both total-spin and point-group symmetry to factor the Hamiltonian matrix into sufficiently small blocks. We demonstrate applications to small rings and polyhedra, some of which are straightforward to solve by successive spin-coupling for Heisenberg terms only; additional interactions, such as biquadratic exchange or multi-center terms necessitate symmetry adaptation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the phase diagram of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of spin-unpolarized and spin-polarized two-dimensional uniform electron liquids using variational and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (VMC and DMC) methods with Slater-Jastrow-backflow trial wave functions. Ground-state VMC and DMC energies are obtained in the density range $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 40$. Single-particle and many-body finite-size errors are corrected using canonical-ensemble twist-averaged boundary conditions and extrapolation of twist-averaged energies to the thermodynamic limit of infinite system size. System-size-dependent errors in Slater-Jastrow-backflow DMC energies caused by partially converged VMC energy minimization calculations are discussed. We find that, for $1 \leq r_\text{s} \leq 5$, optimizing the backflow function at each twist lowers the twist-averaged DMC energy at finite system size. However, nonsystematic system-size-dependent effects remain in the DMC energies, which can be partially removed by extrapolation from multiple finite system sizes to infinite system size. We attribute these nonsystematic effects to the close competition between fluid and defected crystal phases at different system sizes at low density. The DMC energies in the thermodynamic limit are used to parameterize a local spin density approximation correlation functional for inhomogeneous electron systems. Our zero-temperature phase diagram shows a single transition from a paramagnetic fluid to a hexagonal Wigner crystal at $r_\text{s}=35(1)$, with no region of stability for a ferromagnetic fluid.</description>

      <title>Fractional domain wall statistics in spin chains with anomalous symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of domain wall excitations in quantum spin chains. We focus on systems with finite symmetry groups represented by matrix product unitaries (MPUs), i.e. finite depth quantum circuits. Such symmetries can be anomalous, in which case gapped phases which they support must break the symmetry. The lowest lying excitations of those systems are thus domain wall excitations. We investigate the behavior of these domain walls under exchange, and find that they can exhibit non-trivial exchange statistics. This statistics is completely determined by the anomaly of the symmetry, and we provide a direct relation between the known classification of MPU symmetry actions on ground states and the domain wall statistics. Already for the simplest case of a $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry, we obtain that the presence of an anomalous MPU symmetry gives rise to domain wall excitations which behave neither as bosons nor as fermions, but rather exhibit fractional statistics. Finally, we show that the exchange statistics of domain walls is a physically accessible quantity, by devising explicit measurement operators through which it can be determined.</description>

      <title>Metallic local-moment magnetocalorics as a route to cryogenic refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerators still employ the same hydrated salts that were first introduced over 85 years ago. The inherent limitations of these insulating magnetocalorics - poor thermal conductivity at sub-Kelvin temperatures, low entropy density, corrosiveness - can be overcome by a new generation of rare-earth based metallic magnetocalorics. Here, we present the metallic magnetocaloric YbNi1.6 Sn as an attractive alternative to conventional refrigerants. YbNi1.6Sn retains high entropy into the 100 mK regime and avoids the noble metal constituents of alternative refrigerants. Demagnetisation tests demonstrate that YbNi1.6Sn enables economical and durable alternatives to traditional cooling devices for temperatures reaching below 120 mK. We find that the magnetocaloric properties of this material are facilitated by unusually small Kondo and RKKY interactions, which position YbNi1.6Sn in the extreme local moment limit on the generalised Kondo lattice phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism and anomalous magnetotransport properties in rare-earth-based polar semimetals $R$AuGe ($R =$ Dy, Ho, and Gd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetoelastic, and magnetotransport properties of single crystals of polar magnets $R$AuGe ($R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd), grown by Au-Ge self-flux. Magnetization and magnetostriction measurements reveal multi-step metamagnetic transitions for the $c$-axis magnetic field ($H\parallel c$) for DyAuGe and HoAuGe, suggesting magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice of $R$ ions. The magnetic phase diagrams have clarified a close connection between the magnetoelastic property and the emergence of the intermediate metamagentic phase. The magnetic-field dependence of the resistivity and Hall resistivity reveal the semimetallic transport dominated by hole-type carriers, consistent with the behavior in a nonmagnetic analogue YAuGe. We also identify a signature of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) proportional to the field-induced magnetization in $R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd. GdAuGe shows magnetic and transport behavior as reported in a previous study using Bi-flux grown single crystals, while the self-flux grown crystal shows larger magnetoresistance ($\sim$ 345\%, at 1.8 K and 9 T) due to higher hole-type carrier mobility ($\sim$ 6400 cm$^2$/Vs). Using the two-band model analysis considering the mobility change during the magnetization process, we extract the anomalous Hall conductivity: $\sim 1200$ S/cm and $\sim 530$ S/cm for $R=$ Dy and Ho, respectively, at 1.8 K with 9 T for $H\parallel c$. The magnitude of conductivity suggests a contribution of intrinsic origin, possibly related to the Berry curvature in the electron bands induced by the time-reversal symmetry breaking and the polar lattice.</description>

      <title>Dipole-Obstructed Cooper Pairing: Theory and Application to $j=3/2$ Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like electrons, Cooper pairs can carry a monopole charge if the pairing electrons come from two or more Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers. In such an instance, a superconductor is necessarily nodal due to an inherent topological pairing obstruction. In this work, we show that a similar obstruction is also possible when there is only one Fermi surface involved in the pairing process. By developing a Chern-vorticity theorem, we have identified a class of Fermi surfaces with a quantized dipolar Berry flux pattern, where all intra-Fermi-surface Cooper pairings are ``dipole-obstructed" and nodal. As a real-world application, we find that the dipole obstruction plays a crucial role in stabilizing the superconducting nodal structure for $j=3/2$ half-Heusler compounds.</description>

      <title>Beyond a Richardson-Gaudin mean-field: Slater-Condon rules and perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Richardson-Gaudin states provide a basis of the Hilbert space for strongly correlated electrons. In this study, optimal expressions for the transition density matrix elements between Richardson-Gaudin states are obtained with a cost comparable with the corresponding reduced density matrix elements. Analogues of the Slater-Condon rules are identified based on the number of near-zero singular values of the RG state overlap matrix. Finally, a perturbative approach is shown to be close in quality to a configuration interaction of Richardson-Gaudin states while being feasible to compute.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the impacts of phase shifts within the triple-Q spin density wave (SDW) order parameters. Concurrently, it is widely recognized that incommensurate triple-Q charge density waves (CDW) are also prevalent in low-dimensional materials, where the phase degrees of freedom in the order parameters are generally allowed. In this study, we systematically investigate the pivotal effects arising from both triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters, with particular consideration given to possible phase shifts. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in determining the real-space topology of triple-Q density waves. More importantly, we show that the triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters would influence the band geometry in the momentum space, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced by the triple-Q density wave order parameters near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that such nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong super-Heisenberg precision, in terms of system size, throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance of our probe is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and fidelity across quantum phase transitions in locally perturbed topological codes with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the topological-to-non-topological quantum phase transitions (QPTs) occurring in the Kitaev code under local perturbations in the form of local magnetic field and spin-spin interactions of the Ising-type using fidelity susceptibility (FS) and entanglement as the probes. We assume the code to be embedded on the surface of a wide cylinder of height $M$ and circumference $D$ with $M\ll D$. We demonstrate a power-law divergence of FS across the QPT, and determine the quantum critical points (QCPs) via a finite-size scaling analysis. We verify these results by mapping the perturbed Kitaev code to the 2D Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions, and computing the single-site magnetization as order parameter using quantum Monte-Carlo technique. We also point out an odd-even dichotomy in the occurrence of the QPT in the Kitaev ladder with respect to the odd and even values of $D$, when the system is perturbed with only Ising interaction. Our results also indicate a higher robustness of the topological phase of the Kitaev code against local perturbations if the boundary is made open along one direction. We further consider a local entanglement witness operator designed specifically to capture a lower bound to the localizable entanglement on the vertical non-trivial loop of the code. We show that the first derivative of the expectation value of the witness operator exhibits a logarithmic divergence across the QPT, and perform the finite-size scaling analysis. We demonstrate similar behaviour of the expectation value of the appropriately constructed witness operator also in the case of locally perturbed color code with open boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with $SU(2)$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic interactions that determine magnetic order and magnon energies typically involve only two spins. While rare, multi-spin interactions can also appear in quantum magnets and be the driving force in the ground state selection and in the nature of its excitations. By performing time-domain terahertz and magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements combined with theoretical modeling, we determine the origin of the magnon excitation gap in Dirac antiferromagnet CoTiO$_3$. By adding a ring-exchange interaction in a hexagonal plaquette of the honeycomb lattice to both an XXZ spin model and to a low energy spin-orbital flavor wave model, a gap is generated in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center. With this addition, the flavor wave model reproduces a large swath of experimental results including terahertz, Raman, inelastic neutron scattering, and magnetization experiments.</description>

Abstract: We identify an exotic quasiuniversal behavior near the all-in-all-out Weyl quantum critical point in three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, such as the pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, with $R$ a rare-earth element. The quasiuniversal behavior is characterized by power laws with exponents that vary slowly over several orders of magnitude in energy or length. However, in contrast to the quasiuniversality discussed in the context of deconfined criticality, the present case is characterized by a genuinely-universal ultra-low-temperature behavior. In this limit, the pertinent critical exponents can be computed exactly within a renormalization group analysis. Experimental implications for the pyrochlore iridates are outlined.</description>

      <title>Local gate control of Mott metal-insulator transition in a 2D metal-organic framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-electron interactions in materials lead to exotic many-body quantum phenomena including Mott metal-insulator transitions (MITs), magnetism, quantum spin liquids, and superconductivity. These phases depend on electronic band occupation and can be controlled via the chemical potential. Flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) and layered materials with a kagome lattice enhance electronic correlations. Although theoretically predicted, correlated-electron Mott insulating phases in monolayer 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a kagome structure have not yet been realised experimentally. Here, we synthesise a 2D kagome MOF on a 2D insulator. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy reveal a MOF electronic energy gap of ~200 meV, consistent with dynamical mean field theory predictions of a Mott insulator. Combining template-induced (via work function variations of the substrate) and STM probe-induced gating, we locally tune the electron population of the MOF kagome bands and induce Mott MITs. These findings enable technologies based on electrostatic control of many-body quantum phases in 2D MOFs.</description>

      <title>The emergence of antiferromagnetic correlations and Kondo-like features in a two-band model for infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a determinant quantum Monte Carlo study of a two-band model, inspired by infinite-layer nickelates, focusing on the influence of interlayer hybridization between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals derived from Ni (or Ni and O) in one layer and rare-earth ($R$) 5d orbitals in the other layer, hereafter the NI and $R$ layers, respectively. For a filling with one electron shared between the two layers on average, interlayer hybridization leads to "self-doped" holes in the Ni layer and the absence of antiferromagnetic ordering, but rather the appearance of spin-density and charge-density stripe-like states. As the interlayer hybridization increases, both the Ni and $R$ layers develop antiferromagnetic correlations, even though either layer individually remains away from half-filling. For hybridization within an intermediate range, roughly comparable to the intralayer nearest-neighbor hopping $t_{\text{Ni}}$, the model develops signatures of Kondo-like physics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy and deconfined criticality: emergent SO(5) symmetry and proper lattice bipartition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the R\'enyi entanglement entropy (EE) of the two-dimensional $J$-$Q$ model, the emblematic quantum spin model of deconfined criticality at the phase transition between antiferromagnetic and valence-bond-solid ground states. State-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the EE reveal critical corner contributions that scale logarithmically with the system size, with a coefficient in remarkable agreement with the form expected from a large-$N$ conformal field theory with SO($N=5$) symmetry. However, details of the bipartition of the lattice are crucial in order to observe this behavior. If the subsystem for the reduced density matrix does not properly accommodate valence-bond fluctuations, logarithmic contributions appear even for corner-less bipartitions. We here use a $45^\circ$ tilted cut on the square lattice. Beyond supporting an SO($5$) deconfined quantum critical point, our results for both the regular and tilted cuts demonstrate important microscopic aspects of the EE that are not captured by conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03349v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we generalize the Bohr-Sommerfeld rule for scalar symbols at a potential well to matrix-valued symbols having eigenvalues that may coalesce precisely at the bottom of the well. As an application, we study the existence of approximately flat bands in moir\'e heterostructures such as strained two-dimensional honeycomb lattices in a model recently introduced by Timmel and Mele.</description>

      <title>Scalar susceptibility of a diluted classical XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the amplitude fluctuations in a diluted 3D classical XY model near the magnetic phase transition, motivated by the unusual localization properties of the amplitude (Higgs) mode recently found at the disordered superfluid-Mott glass quantum phase transition. We calculate the amplitude correlation function and the corresponding scalar susceptibility by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the quantum case, in which the scalar susceptibility was found to violate naive scaling, we find that the scalar susceptibility of the classical system fulfills naive scaling (employing the clean critical exponents, as expected from the Harris criterion) as the temperature is varied across the phase transition for several dilutions. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy as well as the generality of our findings.</description>

      <title>Lattice Hamiltonian for Adjoint QCD$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian lattice model for the $(1+1)$-dimensional $\text{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to one adjoint Majorana fermion of mass $m$. The discretization of the continuum theory uses staggered Majorana fermions. We analyze the symmetries of the lattice model and find lattice analogs of the anomalies of the corresponding continuum theory. An important role is played by the lattice translation by one lattice site, which in the continuum limit involves a discrete axial transformation. On a lattice with periodic boundary conditions, the Hilbert space breaks up into sectors labeled by the $N_c$-ality $p=0, \ldots N_c-1$. Our symmetry analysis implies various exact degeneracies in the spectrum of the lattice model. In particular, it shows that, for $m=0$ and even $N_c$, the sectors $p$ and $p'$ are degenerate if $|p-p'| = N_c/2$. In the $N_c = 2$ case, we explicitly construct the action of the Hamiltonian on a basis of gauge-invariant states, and we perform both a strong coupling expansion and exact diagonalization for lattices of up to $12$ lattice sites. Upon extrapolation of these results, we find good agreement with the spectrum computed previously using discretized light-cone quantization. One of our new results is the first numerical calculation of the fermion bilinear condensate.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>
