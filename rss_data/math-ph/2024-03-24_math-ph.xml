      <description>arXiv:2403.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some ideas relating to a bracket formulation for dissipative systems are considered. The formulation involves a bracket that is analogous to a generalized Poisson bracket, but possesses a symmetric component. Such a bracket is presented for the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Universality of mean-field antiferromagnetic order in an anisotropic 3D Hubbard model at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the 3D anisotropic Hubbard model on a cubic lattice with hopping parameter $t$ in the $x$- and $y$-directions and a possibly different hopping parameter $t_z$ in the $z$-direction; this model interpolates between the 2D and 3D Hubbard models corresponding to the limiting cases $t_z=0$ and $t_z=t$, respectively. We first derive all-order asymptotic expansions for the density of states. Using these expansions and units such that $t=1$, we analyze how the N\'eel temperature and the antiferromagnetic mean field depend on the coupling parameter, $U$, and on the hopping parameter $t_z$. We derive asymptotic formulas valid in the weak coupling regime, and we study in particular the transition from the three-dimensional to the two-dimensional model as $t_z \to 0$. It is found that the asymptotic formulas are qualitatively different for $t_z = 0$ (the two-dimensional case) and $t_z &gt; 0$ (the case of nonzero hopping in the $z$-direction). Our results show that certain universality features of the three-dimensional Hubbard model are lost in the limit $t_z \to 0$ in which the three-dimensional model reduces to the two-dimensional model.</description>

      <title>Which symmetry group for elementary particles with an electric charge today and in the past?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Kaluza-Klein theory from the perspective of the classification of elementary particles based on the coadjoint orbit method. We study the momentum map of the corresponding symmetry group $G_1$ which conserves the hyperbolic metric. We show that the electric charge is not frame-invariant, in contradiction with the experimental observations. In other words, it is not the symmetry group of the Universe today as we know it. To avert this paradox, we scale the fifth coordinate and consider the limit when the cylinder radius vanishes. For the corresponding group $G_0$, the charge is invariant. On this ground, we propose a cosmological scenario in which the elementary particles of the early Universe are classified from the momenta of the group $G_1$, next the three former dimensions inflate quickly while the fifth one shrinks, leading to the 4D era in which as today the particles are characterized by the momenta of the group $G_0$. By this mechanism, the elementary particles can acquire electric charge as a by-product of the 4 + 1 symmetry breaking of the Universe. This work opens the way to the geometric quantization of charged elementary particles. We construct the corresponding $G_0$-connections by pullback on the space-time. Imposing that the linear 5-momentum is parallel-transported, we recover the conservation of the charge and the equation of motion with Lorentz force. We revisit the variational relativity and obtain the field equations for both the gravitation and electromagnetic interactions with coupling terms which are negligible at the Newtonian approximation, allowing to recover Maxwell equations.</description>

      <title>Localization for quasi-one-dimensional Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a random family of Dirac operators on $N$ parallel real lines, modelling for example a graphene nanoribbon. We establish a localization criterion involving properties on the group generated by transfer matrices. In particular, we consider not only the case where this group is the symplectic group but also a strict subgroup of it. We establish under quite general hypotheses that the sum of the Lyapunov exponents and the integrated density of states are H\"older continuous. Moreover, for a set of concrete cases where the potentials are on Pauli matrices, we compute the transfer matrices and prove either localization or delocalization, depending on the potential and on the parity of $N$.</description>

      <title>Possible ambient kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond classified kinematical algebras, a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian, galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian Klein pairs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spin Helix States as Quantum Many-Body Scars in Partially Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are highly excited eigenstates of non-integrable Hamiltonians which violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and are embedded in a sea of thermal eigenstates. We provide a general mechanism to construct partially integrable models with arbitrarily large local Hilbert space dimensions, which host exact many-body scars. We introduce designed integrability-breaking terms to several exactly solvable spin chains, whose integrable Hamiltonians are composed of the generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra. In the non-integrable subspace of these models, we identify a special kind of product states -- the generalized spin helix states as exact quantum many-body scars, which lie in the common null space of the non-Hermitian generators of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and are annihilated by the integrability-breaking terms. Our constructions establish an intriguing connection between integrability and quantum many-body scars, meanwhile provide a systematic understanding of scarred Hamiltonians from the perspective of non-Hermitian projectors.</description>

      <title>Homological vector fields over differentiable stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we solve the problem of providing a Morita invariant definition of Lie and Courant algebroids over Lie groupoids. By relying on supergeometry, we view these structures as instances of vector fields on graded groupoids which are homological up to homotopy. We describe such vector fields in general from two complementary viewpoints: firstly, as Maurer-Cartan elements in a differential graded Lie algebra of multivector fields and, secondly, we also view them from a categorical approach, in terms of functors and natural transformations. Thereby, we obtain a unifying conceptual framework for studying LA-groupoids, $L_2$-algebroids (including semistrict Lie 2-algebras and 2-term representations up to homotopy), infinitesimal gerbe prequantizations, higher gauge theory (specifically, 2-connections on 2-bundles), quasi-Poisson groupoids and (twisted) multiplicative Courant algebroids.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form strcuture by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <title>The symplectic form associated to a singular Poisson algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an affine Poisson algebra, that is singular one may ask whether there is an associated symplectic form. In the smooth case the answer is obvious: for the symplectic form to exist the Poisson tensor has to be invertible. In the singular case, however, derivations do not form a projective module and it is less clear what non-degenerate means. For a symplectic singularity one may naively ask if there is indeed an analogue of a symplectic form. We examine an example of a symplectic singularity, namely the double cone, and show that here such a symplectic form exists. We use the naive de Rham complex of a Lie-Rinehart algebra. Our analysis of the double cone relies on Gr\"obner bases calculations.</description>

      <title>Two-scale Analysis for Multiscale Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation: Theory and Numerical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the theory and numerical method of two-scale analysis for the multiscale Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in composite ferromagnetic materials. The novelty of this work can be summarized in three aspects: Firstly, the more realistic and complex model is considered, including the effects of the exchange field, anisotropy field, stray field, and external magnetic field. The explicit convergence orders in the $H^1$ norm between the classical solution and the two-scale solution are obtained. Secondly, we propose a robust numerical framework, which is employed in several comprehensive experiments to validate the convergence results for the Periodic and Neumann problems. Thirdly, we design an improved implicit numerical scheme to reduce the required number of iterations and relaxes the constraints on the time step size, which can significantly improve computational efficiency. Specifically, the projection and the expansion methods are given to overcome the inherent non-consistency in the initial data between the multiscale problem and homogenized problem.</description>

      <title>Lecture notes on stationary critical and super-critical SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of these lecture notes is to present recent results regarding the large-scale behaviour of critical and super-critical non-linear stochastic PDEs, that fall outside the realm of the theory of Regularity Structures. These include the two-dimensional Anisotropic KPZ equation, the stochastic Burgers equation in dimension $d\ge 2$ and the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with divergence-free noise in dimension $d=2$. Rather than providing complete proofs, we try to emphasise the main ideas, and some crucial aspects of our approach: the role of the generator equation and of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem to identify the limit process; Wiener chaos decomposition with respect to the stationary measure and its truncation; and the so-called Replacement Lemma, which controls the weak coupling limit of the equations in the critical dimension and identifies the limiting diffusivity. For pedagogical reasons, we will focus exclusively on the stochastic Burgers equation. The notes are based on works in collaboration with Dirk Erhard and Massimiliano Gubinelli.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired classification via efficient simulation of Helstrom measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Helstrom measurement (HM) is known to be the optimal strategy for distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states with minimum error. Previously, a binary classifier based on classical simulation of the HM has been proposed. It was observed that using multiple copies of the sample data reduced the classification error. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in simulation runtime hindered a comprehensive investigation of the relationship between the number of copies and classification performance. We present an efficient simulation method for an arbitrary number of copies by utilizing the relationship between HM and state fidelity. Our method reveals that the classification performance does not improve monotonically with the number of data copies. Instead, it needs to be treated as a hyperparameter subject to optimization, achievable only through the method proposed in this work. We present a Quantum-Inspired Machine Learning binary classifier with excellent performance, providing such empirical evidence by benchmarking on eight datasets and comparing it with 13 hyperparameter optimized standard classifiers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures, highlighting specific features in both 2D systems, such as thin films or curved surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism within confined geometries, the contributions from both volume and surface must be considered, requiring appropriate topological analysis to obtain a complete view of the system. Here, we consider domain walls in cylindrical magnetic nanowires to illustrate the use of topological invariants. We begin with micromagnetic simulations of domain wall transformation under the stimulus of an \OErsted field, tracking bulk and surface topological signatures, and analyzing the interplay between multiple micromagnetic objects. For instance, the extensive analysis allowed us to highlight mechanisms of domain wall type conversion from topologically non-trivial to trivial states, a phenomenon disregarded in previous studies. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence of the transient states predicted to occur during the dynamical process.</description>

      <title>Low-Regularity Solutions of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on the Spatial Quarter-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power nonlinearity formulated on the spatial quarter-plane is established in a low-regularity setting with Sobolev initial data and Dirichlet boundary data in appropriate Bourgain-type spaces. As both of the spatial variables are restricted to the half-line, a different approach is needed than the one previously used for the well-posedness of other initial-boundary value problems. In particular, now the solution of the forced linear initial-boundary problem is estimated \textit{directly}, both in Sobolev spaces and in Strichartz-type spaces, i.e. without a linear decomposition that would require estimates for the associated homogeneous and nonhomogeneous initial value problems. In the process of deriving the linear estimates, the function spaces for the boundary data are identified as the intersections of certain modified Bourgain-type spaces that involve spatial half-line Fourier transforms instead of the usual whole-line Fourier transform found in the definition of the standard Bourgain space associated with the one-dimensional initial value problem. The fact that the quarter-plane has a corner at the origin poses an additional challenge, as it requires one to expand the validity of certain Sobolev extension results to the case of a domain with a non-smooth (Lipschitz) and non-compact boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.02121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study local asymptotics for the spectral projector associated to a Schr\"odinger operator $-\hbar^2\Delta+V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ in the semiclassical limit as $\hbar\to0$. We prove local uniform convergence of the rescaled integral kernel of this projector towards a universal model, inside the classically allowed region as well as on its boundary. This implies universality of microscopic fluctuations for the corresponding free fermions (determinantal) point processes, both in the bulk and around regular boundary points. Our results apply for a general class of smooth potentials in arbitrary dimension $n\ge 1$. These results are complemented by studying both macroscopic and mesoscopic fluctuations of the point process. We obtain tail bounds for macroscopic linear statistics and, provided $n\geq 2$, a central limit theorem for both macroscopic and mesoscopic linear statistics in the bulk.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.17183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a gas of 1D bosons with density $\rho$, interacting through a general, repulsive 2-body potential with scattering length $a$, in the dilute limit $\rho |a|\ll1$. The first terms in the expansion of the thermodynamic energy density are $\pi^2\rho^3/3(1+2\rho a)$, where the leading order is the 1D free Fermi gas. This result covers the Tonks-Girardeau limit of the Lieb-Liniger model as a special case, but given the possibility that $a&gt;0$, it also applies to potentials that differ significantly from a delta function. We include extensions to spinless fermions and 1D anyonic symmetries, and discuss an application to confined 3D gases.</description>

      <title>Tangential Tensor Fields on Deformable Surfaces -- How to Derive Consistent $L^2$-Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.13272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gradient flows of surface energies which depend on the surface by a parameterization and on a tangential tensor field. The flow allows for dissipation by evolving the parameterization and the tensor field simultaneously. This requires the choice of a notation for independence. We introduce different gauges of surface independence and show their consequences for the evolution. In order to guarantee a decrease in energy, the gauge of surface independence and the time derivative have to be chosen consistently. We demonstrate the results for a surface Frank-Oseen-Hilfrich energy.</description>

      <title>Baxter operators in Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system IV. Coupling constant reflection symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new family of commuting Baxter operators in the Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system, different from that considered by us earlier. Using a degeneration of Rains integral identity we verify the commutativity between the two families of Baxter operators and explore this fact for the proof of the coupling constant symmetry of the wave function. We also establish a connection between new Baxter operators and Noumi-Sano difference operators.</description>

      <title>Origin of Symmetry Breaking in the Grasshopper Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The planar grasshopper problem, originally introduced in (Goulko &amp; Kent 2017 Proc. R. Soc. A 473, 20170494), is a striking example of a model with long-range isotropic interactions whose ground states break rotational symmetry. In this work we analyze and explain the nature of this symmetry breaking with emphasis on the importance of dimensionality. Interestingly, rotational symmetry is recovered in three dimensions for small jumps, which correspond to the non-isotropic cogwheel regime of the two-dimensional problem. We discuss simplified models that reproduce the symmetry properties of the original system in N dimensions. For the full grasshopper model in two dimensions we obtain quantitative predictions for optimal perturbations of the disk. Our analytical results are confirmed by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Stability of Spherical Systems in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the non-linear stability of a large class of spherically symmetric equilibrium solutions of both the collisonless Boltzmann equation and of the Euler equations in MOND. This is the first such stability result that is proven with mathematical rigour in MOND. While we strive to prove our stability theorems, we develop new, genuinely Mondian ideas how arising mathematical difficulties can be solved. At some points it was necessary to restrict our analysis to spherical symmetry. We discuss every point where this extra assumption was necessary and outline which efforts must be undertaken to get along without it in future works. In the end we show on the example of a polytropic model how our stability result can be applied.</description>

      <title>Effective light cone and digital quantum simulation of interacting bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.</description>

      <title>Two convergent NPA-like hierarchies for the quantum bilocal scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09065v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterising the correlations that arise from locally measuring a single part of a joint quantum system is one of the main problems of quantum information theory. The seminal work [M. Navascu\'es et al, NJP 10,7,073013 (2008)], known as the NPA hierarchy, reformulated this question as a polynomial optimisation problem over noncommutative variables and proposed a convergent hierarchy of necessary conditions, each testable using semidefinite programming. More recently, the problem of characterising the quantum network correlations, which arise when locally measuring several independent quantum systems distributed in a network, has received considerable interest. Several generalisations of the NPA hierarchy, such as the Scalar Extension [Pozas-Kerstjens et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 140503 (2019)], were introduced while their converging sets remain unknown. In this work, we introduce a new hierarchy, prove its equivalence to the Scalar Extension, and characterise its convergence in the case of the simplest network, the bilocal scenario, and explore its relations with the known generalisations.</description>

Abstract: We prove Saari's conjecture, which states that for any solution to the classical $n$-body problem that has constant (polar) moment of inertia has to behave as a rotating rigid body. Additionally, we remark how Saari's conjecture can be generalised well beyond the confines of the classical $n$-body problem.</description>

      <title>A Generic Topological Criterion for Flat Bands in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a $(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit, where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.</description>

      <title>TBA equations and exact WKB analysis in deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral problem in deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with polynomial superpotential by using the exact WKB method and the TBA equations. We apply the ODE/IM correspondence to the Schr\"odinger equation with an effective potential deformed by integrating out the fermions, which admits a continuous deformation parameter. We find that the TBA equations are described by the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended ones. For cubic superpotential corresponding to the symmetric double-well potential, the TBA system splits into the two $D_3$-type TBA equations. We investigate in detail this example based on the TBA equations and their analytic continuation as well as the massless limit. We find that the energy spectrum obtained from the exact quantization condition is in good agreement with the diagonalization approach of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>On the universal exceptional structure of world-volume theories in string and M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal structure of world-volume theories of half-BPS branes in string and M-theory in terms of exceptional generalised geometry is observed. Previous constructions are extended in two ways: from internal $d$-dimensional space to full 11- or 10-dimensional spacetimes, by coupling to the tensor hierarchy gauge fields, and from $E_{d(d)}$ with $d\leq 6$ to $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{8(8)}$. This is done by a clarification of the role of the tensor hierarchy and its end in the context of brane world-volume theories. The exceptional structure of the gauged $\sigma$-model of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is provided as a new example.</description>
