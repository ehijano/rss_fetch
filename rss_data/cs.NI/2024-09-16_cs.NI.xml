      <title>Towards Scalable Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the scalability challenges and opportunities in quantum communication networks, with the goal of determining parameters that impact networks most as well as the trends that appear when scaling networks. We design simulations of quantum networks comprised of router nodes made up of trapped-ion qubits, separated by quantum repeaters in the form of Bell State Measurement (BSM) nodes. Such networks hold the promise of securely sharing quantum information and enabling high-power distributed quantum computing. Despite the promises, quantum networks encounter scalability issues due to noise and operational errors. Through a modular approach, our research aims to surmount these challenges, focusing on effects from scaling node counts and separation distances while monitoring low-quality communication arising from decoherence effects. We aim to pinpoint the critical features within networks essential for advancing scalable, large-scale quantum computing systems. Our findings underscore the impact of several network parameters on scalability, highlighting a critical insight into the trade-offs between the number of repeaters and the quality of entanglement generated. This paper lays the groundwork for future explorations into optimized quantum network designs and protocols.</description>

      <title>Biased Backpressure Routing Using Link Features and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To reduce the latency of Backpressure (BP) routing in wireless multi-hop networks, we propose to enhance the existing shortest path-biased BP (SP-BP) and sojourn time-based backlog metrics, since they introduce no additional time step-wise signaling overhead to the basic BP. Rather than relying on hop-distance, we introduce a new edge-weighted shortest path bias built on the scheduling duty cycle of wireless links, which can be predicted by a graph convolutional neural network based on the topology and traffic of wireless networks. Additionally, we tackle three long-standing challenges associated with SP-BP: optimal bias scaling, efficient bias maintenance, and integration of delay awareness. Our proposed solutions inherit the throughput optimality of the basic BP, as well as its practical advantages of low complexity and fully distributed implementation. Our approaches rely on common link features and introduces only a one-time constant overhead to previous SP-BP schemes, or a one-time overhead linear in the network size to the basic BP. Numerical experiments show that our solutions can effectively address the major drawbacks of slow startup, random walk, and the last packet problem in basic BP, improving the end-to-end delay of existing low-overhead BP algorithms under various settings of network traffic, interference, and mobility.</description>

      <title>Extensions to BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) for Large Multicast Domains and 1:1 Protection: Concept, Implementation and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) has been proposed by the IETF as a stateless multicast transport technology. BIER adds a BIER header containing a bitstring indicating receivers of an IP multicast (IPMC) packet within a BIER domain. BIER-TE extends BIER with tree engineering capabilities, i.e., the bitstring indicates both receivers as well as links over which the packet is transmitted. As the bitstring is of limited size, e.g., 256 bits, only that number of receivers can be addressed within a BIER packet. To scale BIER to larger networks, the receivers of a BIER domain have been assigned to subsets that can be addressed by a bitstring with a subset ID. This approach is even compliant with fast reroute (FRR) mechanisms for BIER.
  In this work we tackle the challenge of scaling BIER-TE to large networks as the subset mechanism of BIER is not sufficient for that purpose. A major challenge is the support of a protection mechanism in this context. We describe how existing networking concepts like tunneling, egress protection and BIER-TE-FRR can be combined to achieve the goal. Then, we implement the relevant BIER-TE components on the P4-programmable Tofino ASIC which builds upon an existing implementation for BIER. Finally, we consider the forwarding performance of the prototype and explain how weaknesses can be improved from remedies that are well-known for BIER implementations.</description>

      <title>BE-RAN: Blockchain-enabled Open RAN for 6G with DID and Privacy-Preserving Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.10856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As 6G networks evolve towards a synergistic system of Communication, Sensing, and Computing, Radio Access Networks become more distributed, necessitating robust end-to-end authentication. We propose Blockchain-enabled Radio Access Networks, a novel decentralized RAN architecture enhancing security, privacy, and efficiency in authentication processes. BE-RAN leverages distributed ledger technology to establish trust, offering user-centric identity management, enabling mutual authentication, and facilitating on-demand point-to-point inter-network elements and UE-UE communication with accountable logging and billing service add-on for public network users, all without relying on centralized authorities. We envision a thoroughly decentralized RAN model and propose a privacy-preserving P2P communication approach that complements existing security measures while supporting the CSC paradigm. Results demonstrate BE-RAN significantly reduces communication and computation overheads, enhances privacy through decentralized identity management, and facilitates CSC integration, advancing towards more efficient and secure 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Network Anomaly Detection under Data Contamination: Evaluating Robustness and Mitigating Performance Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a crucial tool in network anomaly detection (NAD) for cybersecurity. While DL models for anomaly detection excel at extracting features and learning patterns from data, they are vulnerable to data contamination -- the inadvertent inclusion of attack-related data in training sets presumed benign. This study evaluates the robustness of six unsupervised DL algorithms against data contamination using our proposed evaluation protocol. Results demonstrate significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms when exposed to contaminated data, highlighting the critical need for self-protection mechanisms in DL-based NAD models. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose an enhanced auto-encoder with a constrained latent representation, allowing normal data to cluster more densely around a learnable center in the latent space. Our evaluation reveals that this approach exhibits improved resistance to data contamination compared to existing methods, offering a promising direction for more robust NAD systems.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Privacy: Uncovering the Profiling Practices of Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many companies, including Google, Amazon, and Apple, offer voice assistants as a convenient solution for answering general voice queries and accessing their services. These voice assistants have gained popularity and can be easily accessed through various smart devices such as smartphones, smart speakers, smartwatches, and an increasing array of other devices. However, this convenience comes with potential privacy risks. For instance, while companies vaguely mention in their privacy policies that they may use voice interactions for user profiling, it remains unclear to what extent this profiling occurs and whether voice interactions pose greater privacy risks compared to other interaction modalities.
  In this paper, we conduct 1171 experiments involving a total of 24530 queries with different personas and interaction modalities over the course of 20 months to characterize how the three most popular voice assistants profile their users. We analyze factors such as the labels assigned to users, their accuracy, the time taken to assign these labels, differences between voice and web interactions, and the effectiveness of profiling remediation tools offered by each voice assistant. Our findings reveal that profiling can happen without interaction, can be incorrect and inconsistent at times, may take several days to weeks for changes to occur, and can be influenced by the interaction modality.</description>
