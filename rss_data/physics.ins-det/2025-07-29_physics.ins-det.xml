      <title>First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&amp;D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising, also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct single-shot phase difference retrieval of two wavelength in off-axis digital holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method for direct phase difference reconstruction using single-shot dual-wavelength off-axis digital holography is presented. This approach enables direct imaging of samples with high steps without the need to reconstruct phase images at each individual wavelength. As the dual wavelengths in the reference and object arms pass through a common path in this configuration, single-wavelength arrangements can be applied. Due to the unique capability of the presented method, a sodium-vapor lamp source has been utilized to obtain two closely spaced wavelengths (${\lambda}1 = 589 nm$ and ${\lambda}2 = 589.6 nm$), with in a synthetic wavelength of ${\Lambda} = 578.8 \mu m$ in the Michelson configuration. To evaluate the validity of the method, the height of an air wedge measured using the proposed approach has been compared with the result obtained from phase unwrapping in the single-wavelength method. The capability of the proposed technique to image samples with high step structures is further demonstrated by measuring a $30 \mu m$ step height and a glass plate with a thickness of approximately $140 \mu m$.</description>

      <title>Photomultiplier Requirements and Pre-Calibration for the SABRE South Liquid Scintillator Veto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10353v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the oil-proof base Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the SABRE South linear-alkylbenzene liquid scintillator veto. SABRE South is a dark matter direct detection experiment at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, aiming to test the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter annual modulation signal. We discuss the requirements of the liquid scintillator system and its photomultipliers, outline the methods and analysis used for the characterisation measurements, and results from initial tests. We discuss the impact of these measurements on the performance of the active veto system and explore analysis methods to allow for low threshold operation. Finally, we include results from a small scale liquid scintillator detector prototype used to assess the future performance of pulse shape discrimination in the liquid scintillator veto, and how well accommodated it is by the R5912 PMTs.</description>
