      <title>Compatible Pairs of Low-Dimensional Associative Algebras and Their Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compatible associative algebra is a vector space endowed with two associative multiplication operations that satisfy a natural compatibility condition. In this paper, we investigate and classify compatible pairs of associative algebras of complex dimension less than four. Alongside these classifications, we systematically compute and analyze various algebraic invariants associated with them, including derivations, centroids, automorphism groups, quasi-centroids, Rota-Baxter operators, Nijenhuis operators, averaging operators, Reynolds operators, quasi-derivations, and generalized derivations.</description>

      <title>The Modular Isomorphism Problem over all fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Modular Isomorphism Problem asks, if an isomorphism between modular group algebras of finite $p$-groups over a field $F$ implies an isomorphism of the group bases. We explore the differences of knowledge on the problem when $F$ is either assumed to be a prime field or a general field of characteristic $p$. After revising the literature and explaining reasons for the differences, we generalize some of the positive answers to the problem from the prime field case to the general case.</description>

      <title>Construction of exceptional Lie algebra G2 and non-associative algebras using Clifford algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article uses Clifford algebra of definite signature to derive octonions and the Lie exceptional algebra G2 from calibrations using Pin(7). This is simpler than the usual exterior algebra derivation and uncovers a subalgebra of Spin(7) that enables G2 and an invertible element used to classify six other algebras which are found to be related to the symmetries of G2 in a way that breaks the symmetry of octonions. The 4-form calibration terms of Spin(7) are related to an ideal with three idempotents and provides a direct construction of G2 for each of the 480 representations of the octonions. Clifford algebra thus provides a new construction of G2 without using the Lie bracket. This result is extended to 15 dimensions generating another 100 algebras as well as the sedenions.</description>

      <title>On the lattice of multi-sorted relational clones on a two-element set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to the description of multi-sorted clones (sets of $k$-tuples of operations of the same arity, closed under coordinatewise composition and containing all projection tuples) on a two-element domain. Leveraging the well-known Galois connection between operations and relations, we define a small class of \textit{canonical relations} sufficient to describe all Boolean multi-sorted clones up to non-surjective operations. Furthermore, we introduce \textit{elementary operations} on relations, which are less cumbersome than general formulas and have many useful properties. Using these tools, we provide a~new and elementary proof of the famous Post's lattice theorem. We also show that every multi-sorted clone of $k$-tuples of operations decomposes into a surjective part described by canonical relations and $2k$ clones of $(k-1)$-tuples of operations. This structural understanding allows us to describe an embedding of the lattice of multi-sorted clones into a well-understood poset. In particular, we rederive -- by a simpler method -- a~result of V.~Taimanov originally from 1983, showing that every multi-sorted clone on a two-element domain is finitely generated. Finally, we also give a~concise proof of the Galois connection between (surjective) multi-sorted clones and the corresponding closed sets of relations.</description>

      <title>Derivations and Hochschild cohomology of quantum nilpotent algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the derivations of Quantum Nilpotent Algebras under a technical (but necessary) assumption on the center. As a consequence, we give an explicit description of the first Hochschild cohomology group of $U_q^+(\mathfrak{g})$, the positive part of the quantized enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Our results are obtained leveraging an initial cluster constructed by Goodearl and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>Generating sets, presentations, and growth of tropical matrix monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct minimal and irredundant generating sets for a family of submonoids of the monoid of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over a commutative semiring. We show that the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices over the tropical integers, $M_n(\mathbb{Z}_\mathrm{max})$, is finitely generated if and only if $n \leq 2$, and finitely presented if and only if $n = 1$. Minimal and irredundant generating sets are explicitly constructed when $n \leq 3$. We then construct a presentation for the monoid of $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices over the tropical integers, $UT_n(\mathbb{Z}_\mathrm{max})$, demonstrating that it is finitely presented for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Finally, we establish upper bounds on the polynomial degree of the growth function of finitely generated subsemigroups of the monoid of $n \times n$ matrices over a bipotent semiring and show that these bounds are sharp for the tropical semiring.</description>

      <title>On integral decomposition of unipotent elements in integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jespers and Sun conjectured that if a finite group $G$ has the property ND, i.e. for every nilpotent element $n$ in the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z}G$ and every primitive central idempotent $e \in \mathbb{Q}G$ one still has $ne \in \mathbb{Z}G$, then at most one of the simple components of the group algebra $\mathbb{Q} G$ has reduced degree bigger than $1$. With the exception of one very special series of groups we are able to answer their conjecture, showing that it is true - up to exactly one exception. To do so we first describe groups with the so-called SN property which was introduced by Liu and Passman in their investigation of the Multiplicative Jordan Decomposition for integral group rings.
  We then study further objects connected to the property ND. This concerns on one hand a certain section of the unit group of $\mathbb{Z} G$ which measures how far $G$ is from having ND and about which Jespers and Sun posed two further questions which we answer. On the other hand we introduce two properties which appeared naturally in these investigations: one is purely representation-theoretic, while the other can be regarded as indicating that it might be hard to decide ND. Among others we show these two notions are equivalent for groups with SN.</description>

      <title>Biserial algebras and generic bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider generic bricks and use them in the study of arbitrary biserial algebras over algebraically closed fields. For a biserial algebra $\Lambda$, we show that $\Lambda$ is brick-infinite if and only if it admits a generic brick, that is, there exists a generic $\Lambda$-module $G$ with $End_{\Lambda}(G)=k(x)$. Furthermore, we give an explicit numerical condition for brick-infiniteness of biserial algebras: If $\Lambda$ is of rank $n$, then $\Lambda$ is brick-infinite if and only if there exists an infinite family of bricks of length $d$, for some $2\leq d\leq 2n$. This also results in an algebro-geometric realization of $\tau$-tilting finiteness of this family: $\Lambda$ is $\tau$-tilting finite if and only if $\Lambda$ is brick-discrete, meaning that in every representation variety $mod(\Lambda, \underline{d})$, there are only finitely many orbits of bricks.
  Our results rely on our full classification of minimal brick-infinite biserial algebras in terms of quivers and relations. This is the modern analogue of the recent classification of minimal representation-infinite (special) biserial algebras, given by Ringel. In particular, we show that every minimal brick-infinite biserial algebra is gentle and admits exactly one generic brick. Furthermore, we describe the spectrum of such algebras, which is very similar to that of a tame hereditary algebra. In other words, $Brick(\Lambda)$ is the disjoint union of a unique generic brick with a countable infinite set of bricks of finite length, and a family of bricks of the same finite length parametrized by the ground field.</description>

      <title>Wild blocks of type $A$ Hecke algebras are strictly wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16477v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that all wild blocks of type $A$ Hecke algebras with quantum characteristic $e \geqslant 3$ -- i.e. blocks of weight at least $2$ -- are strictly wild, with the possible exception of the weight $2$ Rouquier block for $e = 3$. As a corollary, we show that for $e \geqslant 3$, all wild blocks of the $q$-Schur algebras are strictly wild, without exception.</description>
