      <title>Terrestrial Life in Light of the Copernican Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While other solar systems are now known in abundance, so far only one example of life is known. Thus, terrestrial life represents just one data point. Thus, extrapolating from terrestrial life to potential life elsewhere in the galaxy and beyond is often considered a limitation in the search for different life. In other words, to extrapolate from terrestrial life to life elsewhere is to say that terrestrial life represent universal life, this is considered to be a geocentric approach. However, according to the Copernican principle, it is the other way around. It is a geocentric view to claim that terrestrial life should be different from other life in the universe. For if life elsewhere is not like terrestrial life, then it is ipso facto different life; more precisely, if terrestrial life does not represent general life, then that life must represent special life, which the principle states it is not. Thus, in this work the Copernican principle has been utilized as a measure for probability, as the criticism is based on the implicit assumptions that different extraterrestrial life exists. So if there are different fundamental forms of life, then there will also be differences in the probabilities with which they can arise in the form of a probability scale. Thus, an example shows that even if it is not is a given that terrestrial life cannot belong to the less numerous categories, it is more reasonable that terrestrial life belongs to the most numerous category due to arising from the simplest conceivable complexity of life. This is important in that not only can much be known about the majority of life elsewhere, but boundaries for categories of life as we do not know it can be set up at the same time. Thus, a Copernican-Darwinian principle offers a fruitful tool for astrobiology and the search for life elsewhere in the galaxy and beyond.</description>

      <title>A plethora of the Earth-like planet: Ramifications of a Fuzzy World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One primary reason for the formulation of the term Earth-like planet and the search for such planets in the galaxy are due to the fact that life has arisen on such a world. Thus, this search seems justifiable since it is here known what one is looking for. However, the Earth-like concept represents an attempt to set up sharp boundaries for an inhabited planet, even though nature often comes as continua. The analyzes in this work show that the term does not represent a clear cut entity as a general Earth likeness cannot be abstracted. Thus, the complex variation of environment and life means that the singular term Earth-like planet is more appropriately treated as a fuzzy world. Such a fuzzification has the consequence that the term is not only more limited than assumed, it may even be deceptive, as an Earth-like planet on the one hand can be in a segment where it does not seem particularly Earth-like, but still possesses life, but on the other hand can appear very Earth-like but not possess life anyway. An atmosphere can provide a biosignature by being displaced from thermodynamic equilibrium, derived from antagonistic adaptation, in which life as a double edged sword on the one hand continuously makes the external environment less favorable for itself, while on the other hand it increases its capacity to do so. Yet, there is an issue with using this as a search criterion for potentially inhabited worlds, as such planets can give impressions that do not reflect what has gone on, it can even give a ghost biosignature. These novel analyzes do not represent a limitation in the search for Earth-like planets, as the plethora of Earth-like planets shows the possibility that the number of inhabited worlds can be large, but it does represent a limitation in the search for life on such worlds.</description>
