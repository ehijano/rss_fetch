      <title>Post-processing improves accuracy of Artificial Intelligence weather forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather models are now reaching operational-grade performance for some variables, but like traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they exhibit systematic biases and reliability issues. We test the application of the Bureau of Meteorology's existing statistical post-processing system, IMPROVER, to ECMWF's deterministic Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), and compare results against post-processed outputs from the ECMWF HRES and ENS models. Without any modification to configuration or processing workflows, post-processing yields comparable accuracy improvements for AIFS as for traditional NWP forecasts, in both expected value and probabilistic outputs. We show that blending AIFS with NWP models improves overall forecast skill, even when AIFS alone is not the most accurate component. These findings show that statistical post-processing methods developed for NWP are directly applicable to AI models, enabling national meteorological centres to incorporate AI forecasts into existing workflows in a low-risk, incremental fashion.</description>

      <title>Physics of an AMOC Overshoot in a Box Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the global average temperature has temporarily exceeded the 1.5{\deg}C goal of the Paris Agreement, and so an overshoot of various climate tipping elements becomes increasingly likely. In this study we analyze the physical processes of an overshoot of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), one of the major tipping elements, using a conceptual box model. Here either the atmospheric temperature above the North Atlantic, or the freshwater forcing into the North Atlantic overshoot their respective critical boundaries. In both cases a higher forcing rate can prevent a collapse of the AMOC, since a higher rate of forcing causes initially a fresher North Atlantic, which in turn results in a higher northward transport by the subtropical gyre supplementing the salinity loss in time. For small exceedance amplitudes the AMOC is still resilient as the forcing rates can be low and so other state variables outside of the North Atlantic can adjust. Contrarily, for larger overshoots the trajectories are dynamically similar and we find a lower limit in volume and exceedance time for respectively freshwater and temperature forcing in order to prevent a collapse. Moreover, for a large overshoot an increased air-sea temperature coupling has a destabilizing effect, while the reverse holds for an overshoot close to the tipping point. The understanding of the physics of the AMOC overshoot behavior is important for interpreting results of Earth System Models and for evaluating the effects of mitigation and intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Long-window tandem variational data assimilation methods for chaotic climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 4D-variational data assimilation is applied to the Lorenz '63 model to introduce a new method for parameter estimation in chaotic climate models. The approach aims to optimise an Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising the adjoint of a different, potentially simpler ESM. This relies on the synchronisation of the model to observed data. Dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) is used to stabilise the tangent linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values, thereby improving parameter estimation by enabling long assimilation windows. The method introduces a second layer of synchronisation between the two models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the trajectory of the model for which no adjoint exists. This is achieved by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in which they differ from one another. If employed on a high-resolution ESM for which a coarse resolution adjoint exists, the method will save computational resources as only one forward run with the full high-resolution ESM per iteration is needed. It is demonstrated that there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the traditional optimisation of a full ESM with an adjoint. Stemming from this approach, it is shown that the synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter noisy data in a dynamical way which reduces the parametric uncertainty of the optimised model by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>

      <title>Supercell environments using GridRad-Severe and the HRRR: Addressing discrepancies between prior tornado datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Storm-relative helicity (SRH) is an important ingredient in supercell development, as well as mesocyclone intensity, and is linked to tornadogenesis and tornado potential. Derived from the storm-relative wind profile, SRH is composed of both the vertical wind shear and storm-relative flow. Recent studies have come to conflicting findings regarding whether shallower or deeper layers of SRH have more skill in tornado forecasting. Possible causes of this discrepancy include the use of observed versus model-based proximity soundings, as well as whether the storm-relative wind profile is determined via observed versus estimated storm motions. This study uses a new dataset of objectively identified supercells, with observed storm motions, paired with high-resolution model analyses to address the discrepancies among prior studies. Unlike in previous model-based tornado environmental datasets, the present approach reveals substantive differences in storm-relative flow, vertical wind shear, and SRH within the low-to-mid-levels between nontornadic and tornadic supercells. Using observed storm motions for storm-relative variables further magnifies differences in the low-to-mid-level storm-relative winds between nontornadic and tornadic supercells, ultimately leading to deeper layers of SRH having more forecast skill than near-ground SRH. Thus, the combination of a higher-resolution model analysis, which better represents the near-storm environment, with observed storm motions appears to explain why many past tornado climatologies using model-based environmental analyses have failed to find significant differences in the storm-relative wind profile. These results help bridge the gap between previous studies that employed coarser model-based analyses and those that aggregated observed soundings from field projects.</description>
