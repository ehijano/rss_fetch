      <title>Secure Storage using Maximally Recoverable Locally Repairable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers data secrecy in distributed storage systems (DSSs) using maximally recoverable locally repairable codes (MR-LRCs). Conventional MR-LRCs are in general not secure against eavesdroppers who can observe the transmitted data during a global repair operation. This work enables nonzero secrecy dimension of DSSs encoded by MR-LRCs through a new repair framework. The key idea is to associate each local group with a central processing unit (CPU), which aggregates and transmits the contribution from the intact nodes of their group to the CPU of a group needing a global repair. The aggregation is enabled by so-called local polynomials that can be generated independently in each group. Two different schemes -- direct repair and forwarded repair -- are considered, and their secrecy dimension using MR-LRCs is derived. Positive secrecy dimension is enabled for several parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Secure Distributed Matrix Multiplication with Precomputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of secure distributed matrix multiplication in which a user wishes to compute the product of two matrices with the assistance of honest but curious servers. We show how to construct polynomial schemes for the outer product partitioning which take advantage of the user's ability to precompute, and provide bounds for our technique. We show that precomputation allows for a reduction in the order of the time complexity for the cases where the number of colluding servers is a fixed percentage of the number of servers. Furthermore, with precomputation, any percentage (less than 100%) of collusions can be tolerated, compared to the upper limit of 50% for the case without precomputation.</description>

      <title>Finite-Length Analysis of Wiretap Codes using Universal Hash Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relation between the second-order coding rate, where the second-order turns out to be strictly larger than $\sqrt{n}$, and the mutual information as the leaked information for a fixed error probability by using wiretap codes constructed by universal$_2$ hash functions. We first generalize the upper bound on $\epsilon$-smooth max information in \cite{tyagi} and use it in our analysis where we adopt the method in \cite{hayashi-tan}, which uses universal hashing for compressing a source and making it secure from another correlated source, and apply it to the wiretap channel. We prove first- and second-order achievability results by assuming that the conjecture we state holds true.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Assisted Adaptive Channel Contention for Mobile Delay-Sensitive Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive channel contention mechanism to optimize the queuing performance of a distributed millimeter wave (mmWave) uplink system with the capability of environment and mobility sensing. The mobile agents determine their back-off timer parameters according to their local knowledge of the uplink queue lengths, channel quality, and future channel statistics, where the channel prediction relies on the environment and mobility sensing. The optimization of queuing performance with this adaptive channel contention mechanism is formulated as a decentralized multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Although the channel contention actions are determined locally at the mobile agents, the optimization of local channel contention policies of all mobile agents is conducted in a centralized manner according to the system statistics before the scheduling. In the solution, the local policies are approximated by analytical models, and the optimization of their parameters becomes a stochastic optimization problem along an adaptive Markov chain. An unbiased gradient estimation is proposed so that the local policies can be optimized efficiently via the stochastic gradient descent method. It is demonstrated by simulation that the proposed gradient estimation is significantly more efficient in optimization than the existing methods, e.g., simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA).</description>

      <title>On $\sigma$ self-orthogonal matrix-product codes associated with Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present four general constructions of $\sigma$ self-orthogonal matrix-product codes associated with Toeplitz matrices. The first one relies on the $\sigma'$ dual of a known $\sigma'$ dual-containing matrix-product code; the second one is founded on quasi-$\widehat{\sigma}$ matrices, where we provide an efficient algorithm for generating them on the basic of Toeplitz matrices; and the last two ones are based on the utilization of certain special Toeplitz matrices. Concrete examples and detailed comparisons are provided. As a byproduct, we also find an application of Toeplitz matrices in $\widetilde{\tau}$-optimal defining matrices.</description>

      <title>Entropic Bounds on the Average Length of Codes with a Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing prefix-free codes in which a designated symbol, a space, can only appear at the end of codewords. We provide a linear-time algorithm to construct almost-optimal codes with this property, meaning that their average length differs from the minimum possible by at most one. We obtain our results by uncovering a relation between our class of codes and the class of one-to-one codes. Additionally, we derive upper and lower bounds to the average length of optimal prefix-free codes with a space in terms of the source entropy.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming of RIS-Aided Wireless Communications: An Alternating Inner Product Maximization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a general discrete $\ell_p$-norm maximization problem, with the power enhancement at steering directions through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as an instance. We propose a mathematically concise iterative framework composed of alternating inner product maximizations, well-suited for addressing $\ell_1$- and $\ell_2$-norm maximizations with either discrete or continuous uni-modular variable constraints. The iteration is proven to be monotonically non-decreasing. Moreover, this framework exhibits a distinctive capability to mitigate performance degradation due to discrete quantization, establishing it as the first post-rounding lifting approach applicable to any algorithm intended for the continuous solution. Additionally, as an integral component of the alternating iterations framework, we present a divide-and-sort (DaS) method to tackle the discrete inner product maximization problem. In the realm of $\ell_\infty$-norm maximization with discrete uni-modular constraints, the DaS ensures the identification of the global optimum with polynomial search complexity. We validate the effectiveness of the alternating inner product maximization framework in beamforming through RISs using both numerical experiments and field trials on prototypes. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher power enhancement and outperforms other competitors. Finally, we show that discrete phase configurations with moderate quantization bits (e.g., 4-bit) exhibit comparable performance to continuous configurations in terms of power gains.</description>

      <title>On RadCom channel capacity for V2V applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of millimiter wave (mmWave) for communication and sensing purposes is one of the functions powered by Next Generation Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) networks. The arrival of IEEE~802.11bd, which is able to operate in the 60 GHz band, opens the doors of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) to vehicular networks. Similarly, Radar-based Communications (RadCom) proposes the use of the radar spectrum for communication puproses. In this paper, we perform an analysis of the channel capacity for different configurations of RadCom, showing its potential to offload the V2X spectrum for bumper-to-bumper V2X applications. We finalize with a discussion on the potential for ISAC from both the 802.11bd and RadCom approaches.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Sum-Rate Maximization in Fluid Antenna-Assisted ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the fluid antenna (FA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where communication and radar sensing employ the co-waveform design. Specifically, we focus on the beamformer design and antenna position configuration to realize a higher communication rate while guaranteeing the minimum radar probing power. Different from existing beamformer algorithms, we propose an efficient proximal distance algorithm (PDA) to solve the multiuser sum-rate maximization problem with radar sensing constraint to obtain the closed-form beamforming vector. In addition, we develop an extrapolated projected gradient (EPG) algorithm to obtain a better antenna location configuration for FA to enhance the ISAC performance. Numerical results show that the considered FA-assisted ISAC system enjoys a higher sum-rate by the proposed algorithm, compared with that in existing non-FA ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>A Distributionally Robust Approach to Shannon Limits using the Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the rate-distortion function for lossy source compression, as well as the channel capacity for error correction, through the lens of distributional robustness. We assume that the distribution of the source or of the additive channel noise is unknown and lies within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set of a given radius centered around a specified nominal distribution, and we look for the worst-case asymptotically optimal coding rate over such an ambiguity set. Varying the radius of the ambiguity set allows us to interpolate between the worst-case and stochastic scenarios using probabilistic tools. Our problem setting fits into the paradigm of compound source / channel models introduced by Sakrison and Blackwell, respectively. This paper shows that if the nominal distribution is Gaussian, then so is the worst-case source / noise distribution, and the compound rate-distortion / channel capacity functions admit convex formulations with Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. These formulations yield simple closed-form expressions in the scalar case, offering insights into the behavior of Shannon limits with the changing radius of the Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set.</description>

      <title>Tradeoffs among Action Taking Policies Matter in Active Sequential Multi-Hypothesis Testing: the Optimal Error Exponent Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability of sequential hypothesis testing can be greatly improved when decision maker is given the freedom to adaptively take an action that determines the distribution of the current collected sample. Such advantage of sampling adaptivity has been realized since Chernoff's seminal paper in 1959. While a large body of works have explored and investigated the gain of adaptivity, in the general multiple-hypothesis setting, the fundamental limits of individual error probabilities have not been fully understood. In particular, in the asymptotic regime as the expected stopping time tends to infinity, the error exponents are only characterized in specific cases, such as that of the total error probability. In this paper, we consider a general setup of active sequential multiple-hypothesis testing where at each time slot, a temporally varying subset of data sources (out of a known set) emerges from which the decision maker can select to collect samples, subject to a family of expected selection budget constraints. The selection of sources, understood as the "action" at each time slot, is constrained in a predefined action space. At the end of each time slot, the decision maker either decides to make the inference on the $M$ hypotheses, or continues to observe the data sources for the next time slot. The optimal tradeoffs among $M(M-1)$ types of error exponents are characterized, and the achievable region is shown to be a convex polytope. A companion asymptotically optimal test that strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation is proposed to achieve any target error exponents within the region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature to identify such tradeoffs among error exponents, and it uncovers the tension among different action taking policies even in the basic setting of Chernoff.</description>

      <title>Private Repair of a Single Erasure in Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of privately recovering a single erasure for Reed-Solomon codes with low communication bandwidths. For an $[n,k]_{q^\ell}$ code with $n-k\geq q^{m}+t-1$, we construct a repair scheme that allows a client to recover an arbitrary codeword symbol without leaking its index to any set of $t$ colluding helper nodes at a repair bandwidth of $(n-1)(\ell-m)$ sub-symbols in $\mathbb{F}_q$. When $t=1$, this reduces to the bandwidth of existing repair schemes based on subspace polynomials. We prove the optimality of the proposed scheme when $n=q^\ell$ under a reasonable assumption about the schemes being used. Our private repair scheme can also be transformed into a private retrieval scheme for data encoded by Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>On Streaming Codes for Burst and Random Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming codes (SCs) are packet-level codes that recover erased packets within a strict decoding-delay deadline. Streaming codes for various packet erasure channel models such as sliding-window (SW) channel models that admit random or burst erasures in any SW of a fixed length have been studied in the literature, and the optimal rate as well as rate-optimal code constructions of SCs over such channel models are known. In this paper, we study error-correcting streaming codes ($\text{SC}_{\text{ERR}}$s), i.e., packet-level codes which recover erroneous packets within a delay constraint. We study $\text{SC}_{\text{ERR}}$s for two classes of SW channel models, one that admits random packet errors, and another that admits multiple bursts of packet errors, in any SW of a fixed length. For the case of random packet errors, we establish the equivalence of an $\text{SC}_{\text{ERR}}$ and a corresponding SC that recovers from random packet erasures, thus determining the optimal rate of an $\text{SC}_{\text{ERR}}$ for this setting, and providing a rate-optimal code construction for all parameters. We then focus on SCs that recover from multiple erasure bursts and derive a rate-upper-bound for such SCs. We show the necessity of a divisibility constraint for the existence of an SC constructed by the popular diagonal embedding technique, that achieves this rate-bound under a stringent delay requirement. We then show that a construction known in the literature achieves this rate-bound when the divisibility constraint is met. We further show the equivalence of the SCs considered and $\text{SC}_{\text{ERR}}$s for the setting of multiple error bursts, under a stringent delay requirement.</description>

      <title>On Streaming Codes for Simultaneously Correcting Burst and Random Erasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming codes are packet-level codes that recover dropped packets within a strict decoding-delay constraint. We study streaming codes over a sliding-window (SW) channel model which admits only those erasure patterns which allow either a single burst erasure of $\le b$ packets along with $\le e$ random packet erasures, or else, $\le a$ random packet erasures, in any sliding-window of $w$ time slots. We determine the optimal rate of a streaming code constructed via the popular diagonal embedding (DE) technique over such a SW channel under delay constraint $\tau=(w-1)$ and provide an $O(w)$ field size code construction. For the case $e&gt;1$, we show that it is not possible to significantly reduce this field size requirement, assuming the well-known MDS conjecture. We then provide a block code construction whose DE yields a streaming code achieving the rate derived above, over a field of size sub-linear in $w,$ for a family of parameters having $e=1.$ We show the field size optimality of this construction for some parameters, and near-optimality for others under a sparsity constraint. Additionally, we derive an upper-bound on the $d_{\text{min}}$ of a cyclic code and characterize cyclic codes which achieve this bound via their ability to simultaneously recover from burst and random erasures.</description>

      <title>On Existence of Latency Optimal Uncoded Storage Schemes in Geo-Distributed Data Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of geographically distributed data storage in a network of servers (or nodes) where the nodes are connected to each other via communication links having certain round-trip times (RTTs). Each node serves a specific set of clients, where a client can request for any of the files available in the distributed system. The parent node provides the requested file if available locally; else it contacts other nodes that have the data needed to retrieve the requested file. This inter-node communication incurs a delay resulting in a certain latency in servicing the data request. The worst-case latency incurred at a servicing node and the system average latency are important performance metrics of a storage system, which depend not only on inter-node RTTs, but also on how the data is stored across the nodes. Data files could be placed in the nodes as they are, i.e., in uncoded fashion, or can be coded and placed. This paper provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of uncoded storage schemes that are optimal in terms of both per-node worst-case latency and system average latency. In addition, the paper provides efficient binary storage codes for a specific case where optimal uncoded schemes do not exist.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated as an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, current research has concentrated on minimizing a standard distortion metric such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), which does not necessarily improve the perceptual quality. To address this issue, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to enhance the realism of images transmitted over the channel. The proposed DiffJSCC utilizes prior deep JSCC frameworks to deliver an initial reconstructed image at the receiver. Then, the spatial and textual features are extracted from the initial reconstruction, which, together with the channel state information (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, SNR), are passed to a control module to fine-tune the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. Extensive experiments on the Kodak dataset reveal that our method significantly surpasses both conventional methods and prior deep JSCC approaches on perceptual metrics such as LPIPS and FID scores, especially with poor channel conditions and limited bandwidth.

      <title>Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations: Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$ is due to the learning error of the observer's column space in the presence of high-dimensional noise. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed, facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity lower bound in certain scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every $m$-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Such a state spans a pure [[n,0,m+1]] quantum error correcting code (QECC). Starting with an $m$-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we construct codeword stabilized (CWS) codes that are pure [[n,k,m+1]] QECCs. We propose measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and recovery of logical qubits from code states. Our proposed protocols support sequential encoding and partial recovery of logical qubits, which can be useful for quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement sharing across a damping-dephasing channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement distillation is a fundamental information processing task whose implementation is key to quantum communication and modular quantum computing. Noise experienced by such communication and computing platforms occurs not only in the form of Pauli noise such as dephasing (sometimes called $T_2$) but also non-Pauli noise such as amplitude damping (sometimes called $T_1$). We initiate a study of practical and asymptotic distillation over what we call the joint damping-dephasing noise channel. In the practical setting, we propose a distillation scheme that completely isolates away the damping noise. In the asymptotic setting we derive lower bounds on the entanglement sharing capacities including the coherent and reverse coherent information. Like the protocol achieving the reverse coherent information, our scheme uses only backward classical communication. However, for realistic damping noise ($T_1 \neq 2T_2$) our strategy can exceed the reverse coherent strategy, which is the best known for pure damping. In the forward communication setting we numerically exceed the single-letter coherent information strategy by observing the channel displays non-additivity at the two-letter level. The work shows non-additivity can also be found in realistic noise models with magnitudes of non-additivity similar to those found in more idealized noise channels.</description>

      <title>Improving the Privacy Loss Under User-Level DP Composition for Fixed Estimation Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the private release of statistics of several disjoint subsets of a datasets, under user-level $\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP). In particular, we consider the user-level differentially private release of sample means and variances of speed values in several grids in a city, in a potentially sequential manner. Traditional analysis of the privacy loss due to the sequential composition of queries necessitates a privacy loss degradation by a factor that equals the total number of grids. Our main contribution is an iterative, instance-dependent algorithm, based on clipping the number of user contributions, which seeks to reduce the overall privacy loss degradation under a canonical Laplace mechanism, while not increasing the {worst} estimation error among the different grids. We test the performance of our algorithm on synthetic datasets and demonstrate improvements in the privacy loss degradation factor via our algorithm. We also demonstrate improvements in the worst-case error using a simple extension of a pseudo-user creation-based mechanism. An important component of this analysis is our exact characterization of the sensitivities and the worst-case estimation errors of sample means and variances incurred by clipping user contributions in an arbitrary fashion, which we believe is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sharp analysis of out-of-distribution error for "importance-weighted" estimators in the overparameterized regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overparameterized models that achieve zero training error are observed to generalize well on average, but degrade in performance when faced with data that is under-represented in the training sample. In this work, we study an overparameterized Gaussian mixture model imbued with a spurious feature, and sharply analyze the in-distribution and out-of-distribution test error of a cost-sensitive interpolating solution that incorporates "importance weights". Compared to recent work Wang et al. (2021), Behnia et al. (2022), our analysis is sharp with matching upper and lower bounds, and significantly weakens required assumptions on data dimensionality. Our error characterizations also apply to any choice of importance weights and unveil a novel tradeoff between worst-case robustness to distribution shift and average accuracy as a function of the importance weight magnitude.</description>

      <title>Compressing Sign Information in DCT-based Image Coding via Deep Sign Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compressing the sign information of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients is an intractable problem in image coding schemes due to the equiprobable characteristics of the signs. To overcome this difficulty, we propose an efficient compression method for the sign information called "sign retrieval." This method is inspired by phase retrieval, which is a classical signal restoration problem of finding the phase information of discrete Fourier transform coefficients from their magnitudes. The sign information of all DCT coefficients is excluded from a bitstream at the encoder and is complemented at the decoder through our sign retrieval method. We show through experiments that our method outperforms previous ones in terms of the bit amount for the signs and computation cost. Our method, implemented in Python language, is available from https://github.com/ctsutake/dsr.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a signal reconstruction method for zero-knowledge one-way communication channels in which a receiver aims to interpret a message sent by an unknown source about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our reconstruction method is agnostic vis-\`a-vis the arbitrarily chosen encoding-decoding scheme and other observer-dependent characteristics, such as the arbitrarily chosen computation model or underlying mathematical theory. We investigate how non-random messages may encode information about the physical properties, such as dimension and length scales of the space in which a signal or message may have been originally encoded, embedded, or generated. We argue that our results have applications to life and technosignature detection and to coding theory in general.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and characterize the Multi-cluster Two-Wave (MTW) fading model, which generalizes \textit{both} the Durgin's Two-Wave with Diffuse Power (TWDP) and the $\kappa$-$\mu$ models under a common umbrella. The MTW model consists of an arbitrary number of clusters of waves each of which may include one or two dominant (specular) components. The chief probability functions of the MTW fading model are obtained, including the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function and the generalized moment-generating function. \textcolor{black}{The proposed model is empirically validated using channel measurements in the sub-THz band and} a number of applications are exemplified, including the outage probability in noise-limited and interference-limited scenarios and the energy detection probability. %Exact expressions for the outage capacity are also obtained. A composite Inverse Gamma (IG)/MTW model is also investigated, thus extending the proposed propagation model to include shadowing.</description>

      <title>Leveraging IRS Induced Time Delay for Enhanced Physical Layer Security in VLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indoor visible light communication (VLC) is considered secure against attackers outside the confined area where the light propagates, but it is still susceptible to interception from inside the coverage area. A new technology, intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), has been recently introduced, offering a way to enhance physical layer security (PLS). Most research on IRS-assisted VLC assumes the same time of arrival from all reflecting elements and overlooks the effect of time delay and the associated intersymbol interference. This paper tackles, for the first time, the effect of time delay on the secrecy rate in VLC systems. Our results show that, at a fixed light-emitting diode (LED) power of 3W, the secrecy rate can be enhanced by up to 253\% at random positions for the legitimate user when the eavesdropper is located within a 1-meter radius of the LED. Our results also show that careful allocation of the IRS elements can lead to enhanced PLS even when the eavesdropper has a more favourable position and, thus, a better channel gain than the legitimate user.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sampling for Uncertainty-of-Information Minimization in a Remote Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a remote monitoring system where a receiver observes a remote binary Markov source and decides whether to sample and transmit the state through a randomly delayed channel. We adopt uncertainty of information (UoI), defined as the entropy conditional on past observations at the receiver, as a metric of value of information, in contrast to the traditional state-agnostic nonlinear age of information (AoI) penalty functions. To address the limitations of prior UoI research that assumes one-time-slot delays, we extend our analysis to scenarios with random delays. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem and simplify it to a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) by introducing the belief state. We propose two algorithms: A globally optimal bisection relative value iteration (bisec-RVI) algorithm and a computationally efficient sub-optimal index-based threshold algorithm to solve the long-term average UoI minimization problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our sampling policies surpass traditional zero wait and AoI-optimal policies, particularly under conditions of large delay, with the sub-optimal policy nearly matching the performance of the optimal one.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communication is an emerging feature for future networks like 6G, which emphasizes the meaning of the message in contrast to the traditional approach where the meaning of the message is irrelevant. Yet, the open nature of a wireless channel poses security risks for semantic communications. In this paper, we derive information-theoretic limits for the secure transmission of semantic source over wiretap channel. Under separate equivocation and distortion conditions for semantics and observed data, we present the general outer and inner bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region. We also reduce the general region to a case of Gaussian source and channel and provide numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>A Novel and Optimal Spectral Method for Permutation Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation synchronization is an important problem in computer science that constitutes the key step of many computer vision tasks. The goal is to recover $n$ latent permutations from their noisy and incomplete pairwise measurements. In recent years, spectral methods have gained increasing popularity thanks to their simplicity and computational efficiency. Spectral methods utilize the leading eigenspace $U$ of the data matrix and its block submatrices $U_1,U_2,\ldots, U_n$ to recover the permutations. In this paper, we propose a novel and statistically optimal spectral algorithm. Unlike the existing methods which use $\{U_jU_1^\top\}_{j\geq 2}$, ours constructs an anchor matrix $M$ by aggregating useful information from all of the block submatrices and estimates the latent permutations through $\{U_jM^\top\}_{j\geq 1}$. This modification overcomes a crucial limitation of the existing methods caused by the repetitive use of $U_1$ and leads to an improved numerical performance. To establish the optimality of the proposed method, we carry out a fine-grained spectral analysis and obtain a sharp exponential error bound that matches the minimax rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safety guarantees and security-latency problem of Nakamoto consensus have been extensively studied in the last decade with a bounded delay model. Recent studies have shown that PoW protocol is secure under random delay models as well. In this paper, we analyze the security-latency problem, i.e., how secure a block is, after it becomes k-deep in the blockchain, under general random delay distributions. We provide tight and explicit bounds which only require determining the distribution of the number of Poisson arrivals during the random delay. We further consider potential effects of recent Bitcoin halving on the security-latency problem by extending our results.</description>
