      <title>Rigidity and Realizability for Tropical Curves in Dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an unobstructedness criterion for Lagrangian threefolds $L\subset X^A$ using the $H_1(L)$-class associated with the boundary of a pseudoholomorphic disk.
  As an application, let $X^A\to Q$ be a Lagrangian torus fibration whose base $Q$ is a tropical abelian threefold. Given $V\subset Q$ a rigid tropical curve with a pair-of-pants decomposition, we prove that the Lagrangian lift $L_V\subset X^A$ is unobstructed.
  Provided that an appropriate homological mirror symmetry statement holds, this implies the existence of a realization $Y_V$ in the mirror abelian threefold $X^B\to Q$.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous bi-Hamiltonian structures and integrable contact systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi-Hamiltonian structures can be utilised to compute a maximal set of functions in involution for certain integrable systems, given by the eigenvalues of the recursion operator relating both Poisson structures. We show that the recursion operator relating two compatible Jacobi structures cannot produce a maximal set of functions in involution. However, as we illustrate with an example, bi-Hamiltonian structures can still be used to obtain a maximal set of functions in involution on a contact manifold, at the cost of symplectisation.</description>

      <title>A new transversality condition on orbifolds and integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following a proposal of Fukaya-Ono and the exploration by B. Parker, we introduce a new transversality condition, the FOP transversality condition, for sections of orbifold vector bundles $\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{U}$ when both $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{U}$ have "normal complex structures." This notion allows one to define various integral virtual cycles on moduli spaces of pseudoholomorphic curves. Two immediate applications in symplectic topology are the definition of integer-valued Gromov-Witten type invariants in all genera for general compact symplectic manifolds using the global Kuranishi chart constructed by Abouzaid-McLean-Smith and Hirschi-Swaminathan, and an alternative proof of the cohomological splitting theorem for Hamiltonian fibrations over $S^2$ with integer coefficients by Abouzaid-McLean-Smith.</description>

      <title>Contact instantons, anti-contact involution and proof of Shelukhin's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Shelukhin's conjecture on the translated points on any closed contact manifold $(Q,\xi)$ which reads that for any choice of function $H = H(t,x)$ and contact form $\lambda$ the contactomorphism $\psi_H^1$ carries a translated point in the sense of Sandon, whenever the inequality $$ \|H\| \leq T(\lambda,M) $$ holds the case. Main geometro-analytical tools are those of bordered contact instantons employed in [Ohc] with Legendrian boundary condition via the Legendrianization of contact diffeomorphisms. Along the way, we utilize the functorial construction of the contact product that carries an involutive symmetry and develop relevant contact Hamiltonian geometry with involutive symmetry. This involutive symmetry plays a fundamental role in our proof in combination with the analysis of contact instantons.</description>

      <title>E-structures and almost regular Poisson manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, $b$-symplectic manifolds have become important structures in the study of symplectic geometry, serving as Poisson manifolds that retain symplectic properties away from a hypersurface. Inspired by this rich landscape, $E$-structures were introduced by Nest and Tsygan in \cite{NT2} as a comprehensive framework for exploring generalizations of $b$-structures. This paper initiates a deeper investigation into their Poisson facets, building on foundational work by \cite{MS21}. We also examine the closely related concept of almost regular Poisson manifolds, as studied in \cite{AZ17}, which reveals a natural Poisson groupoid associated with these structures.
  In this article, we investigate the intricate relationship between $E$-structures and almost regular Poisson structures. Our comparative analysis not only scrutinizes their Poisson properties but also offers explicit formulae for the Poisson structure on the Poisson groupoid associated to the $E$-structures as both Poisson manifolds and singular foliations. In doing so, we reveal an interesting link between the existence of commutative frames and Darboux-Carath\'eodory-type expressions for the relevant structures.</description>

      <title>Constructing smoothings of stable maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety. Define a stable map $f:C\to X$ to be "eventually smoothable" if there is an embedding $X\hookrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ such that $(C,f)$ occurs as the limit of a $1$-parameter family of stable maps to $\mathbb{P}^N$ with smooth domain curves. Via an explicit deformation-theoretic construction, we produce a large class of stable maps (called "stable maps with model ghosts"), and show that they are eventually smoothable.</description>

      <title>Counting Curves with Tangencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10759v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting tangency as a limit of two transverse intersections, we obtain a concrete formula to enumerate smooth degree $d$ plane curves tangent to a given line at multiple points with arbitrary order of tangency. Extending that idea, we then enumerate curves with one node with multiple tangencies to a given line of any order. Subsequently, we enumerate curves with one cusp, that are tangent to first order to a given line at multiple points. We also present a new way to enumerate curves with one node; it is interpreted as a degeneration of a curve tangent to a given line. That method is extended to enumerate curves with two nodes, and also curves with one tacnode are enumerated. In the final part of the paper, it is shown how this idea can be applied in the setting of stable maps and perform a concrete computation to enumerate rational curves with first-order tangency. A large number of low degree cases have been worked out explicitly.</description>

      <title>Ergodic closing lemmas and invariant Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the ergodic closing lemma of Ma\~n\'e, we investigate the $C^\infty$ closing lemma in higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, with a focus on the statistical behavior of periodic orbits generated by $C^\infty$-small perturbations. We demonstrate that, under certain Floer-theoretic conditions, invariant or recurrent Lagrangian submanifolds can give rise to periodic orbits whose statistical properties are controllable. For instance, we show that for Hamiltonian systems preserving the zero section in $T^*\mathbb{T}^n$, $C^\infty$ generically, there exist periodic orbits converging to an invariant measure supported on the zero section.</description>
