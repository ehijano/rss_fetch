      <title>A (1.999999)-approximation ratio for vertex cover problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until the authenticity of the unique games conjecture is proven, it can be thought to be false. Therefore, I request you, dear reader, to read this paper carefully, and if you don't find any mistake in it, think about the option that maybe unique games conjecture is not correct! If the unique games conjecture is true then it is impossible to produce a less than 2 approximation ratio for the vertex cover problem. Vertex cover problem is a famous combinatorial problem, which its complexity has been heavily studied over the years and while a 2-approximation for it can be trivially obtained, researchers have not been able to approximate it better than 2-o(1). In this paper, by a combination of a new semidefinite programming formulation along with satisfying new proposed properties, we introduce an approximation algorithm for the vertex cover problem with a performance ratio of 1.999999 on arbitrary graphs, en route to answering an open question about the unique games conjecture.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of the Recoverable Robust Shortest Path Problem with Discrete Recourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the recoverable robust shortest path problem is investigated. Discrete budgeted interval uncertainty representation is used to model uncertain second-stage arc costs. The known complexity results for this problem are strengthened. It is shown that it is Sigma_3^p-hard for the arc exclusion and the arc symmetric difference neighborhoods. Furthermore, it is also proven that the inner adversarial problem for these neighborhoods is Pi_2^p-hard.</description>

      <title>A New Information Complexity Measure for Multi-pass Streaming with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of information complexity for multi-pass streaming problems and use it to resolve several important questions in data streams.
  In the coin problem, one sees a stream of $n$ i.i.d. uniform bits and one would like to compute the majority with constant advantage. We show that any constant pass algorithm must use $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of memory, significantly extending an earlier $\Omega(\log n)$ bit lower bound for single-pass algorithms of Braverman-Garg-Woodruff (FOCS, 2020). This also gives the first $\Omega(\log n)$ bit lower bound for the problem of approximating a counter up to a constant factor in worst-case turnstile streams for more than one pass.
  In the needle problem, one either sees a stream of $n$ i.i.d. uniform samples from a domain $[t]$, or there is a randomly chosen needle $\alpha \in[t]$ for which each item independently is chosen to equal $\alpha$ with probability $p$, and is otherwise uniformly random in $[t]$. The problem of distinguishing these two cases is central to understanding the space complexity of the frequency moment estimation problem in random order streams. We show tight multi-pass space bounds for this problem for every $p &lt; 1/\sqrt{n \log^3 n}$, resolving an open question of Lovett and Zhang (FOCS, 2023); even for $1$-pass our bounds are new. To show optimality, we improve both lower and upper bounds from existing results.
  Our information complexity framework significantly extends the toolkit for proving multi-pass streaming lower bounds, and we give a wide number of additional streaming applications of our lower bound techniques, including multi-pass lower bounds for $\ell_p$-norm estimation, $\ell_p$-point query and heavy hitters, and compressed sensing problems.</description>

      <title>Local Correction of Linear Functions over the Boolean Cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of locally correcting, and locally list-correcting, multivariate linear functions over the domain $\{0,1\}^n$ over arbitrary fields and more generally Abelian groups. Such functions form error-correcting codes of relative distance $1/2$ and we give local-correction algorithms correcting up to nearly $1/4$-fraction errors making $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log n)$ queries. This query complexity is optimal up to $\mathrm{poly}(\log\log n)$ factors. We also give local list-correcting algorithms correcting $(1/2 - \varepsilon)$-fraction errors with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(\log n)$ queries.
  These results may be viewed as natural generalizations of the classical work of Goldreich and Levin whose work addresses the special case where the underlying group is $\mathbb{Z}_2$. By extending to the case where the underlying group is, say, the reals, we give the first non-trivial locally correctable codes (LCCs) over the reals (with query complexity being sublinear in the dimension (also known as message length)).
  The central challenge in constructing the local corrector is constructing ``nearly balanced vectors'' over $\{-1,1\}^n$ that span $1^n$ -- we show how to construct $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ vectors that do so, with entries in each vector summing to $\pm1$. The challenge to the local-list-correction algorithms, given the local corrector, is principally combinatorial, i.e., in proving that the number of linear functions within any Hamming ball of radius $(1/2-\varepsilon)$ is $\mathcal{O}_{\varepsilon}(1)$. Getting this general result covering every Abelian group requires integrating a variety of known methods with some new combinatorial ingredients analyzing the structural properties of codewords that lie within small Hamming balls.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies lose the Betting game on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness (KLR) is the same as Martin-L\"of randomness (MLR) is a major open problem in the study of algorithmic randomness. More general classes of betting strategies than Kolmogorov-Loveland ones have been studied in \cite{MMS, Rute, TP} and in each case it was proven that the class induces a notion of randomness equivalent to MLR. In all of those proofs it was shown that the class contains a finite set of betting strategies such that for any given bound, when betting on a binary sequence contained in an effective open set of small enough measure, at least one of the betting strategies in the set earns capital larger than the bound. We show that the class of Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies does not have this property.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Manipulation and Bribery in Premise-Based Judgment Aggregation with Simple Formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Judgment aggregation is a framework to aggregate individual opinions on multiple, logically connected issues into a collective outcome. These opinions are cast by judges, which can be for example referees, experts, advisors or jurors, depending on the application and context. It is open to manipulative attacks such as \textsc{Manipulation} where judges cast their judgments strategically. Previous works have shown that most computational problems corresponding to these manipulative attacks are \NP-hard. This desired computational barrier, however, often relies on formulas that are either of unbounded size or of complex structure.
  We revisit the computational complexity for various \textsc{Manipulation} and \textsc{Bribery} problems in premise-based judgment aggregation, now focusing on simple and realistic formulas. We restrict all formulas to be clauses that are (positive) monotone, Horn-clauses, or have bounded length. For basic variants of \textsc{Manipulation}, we show that these restrictions make several variants, which were in general known to be \NP-hard, polynomial-time solvable. Moreover, we provide a P vs.\ NP dichotomy for a large class of clause restrictions (generalizing monotone and Horn clauses) by showing a close relationship between variants of \textsc{Manipulation} and variants of \textsc{Satisfiability}. For Hamming distance based \textsc{Manipulation}, we show that \NP-hardness even holds for positive monotone clauses of length three, but the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable for positive monotone clauses of length two. For \textsc{Bribery}, we show that \NP-hardness even holds for positive monotone clauses of length two, but it becomes polynomial-time solvable for the same clause set if there is a constant budget.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query Locally Testable Codes and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>
