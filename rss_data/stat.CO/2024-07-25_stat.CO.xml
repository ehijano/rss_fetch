      <title>Provable Benefit of Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Non-log-concave Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the outstanding problem of sampling from an unnormalized density that may be non-log-concave and multimodal. To enhance the performance of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, techniques of annealing type have been widely used. However, quantitative theoretical guarantees of these techniques are under-explored. This study takes a first step toward providing a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed MCMC. Specifically, we establish, for the first time, an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\cal A}^2}{\varepsilon^6}\right)$ for simple annealed Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm to achieve $\varepsilon^2$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution $\pi\propto{\rm e}^{-V}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\beta$-smooth potential $V$. Here, ${\cal A}$ represents the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating the target distribution $\pi$ and a readily sampleable distribution.</description>

      <title>Binscatter Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09615v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the package Binsreg, which implements the binscatter methods developed by Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell, and Feng (2024b,a). The package includes seven commands: binsreg, binslogit, binsprobit, binsqreg, binstest, binspwc, and binsregselect. The first four commands implement binscatter plotting, point estimation, and uncertainty quantification (confidence intervals and confidence bands) for least squares linear binscatter regression (binsreg) and for nonlinear binscatter regression (binslogit for Logit regression, binsprobit for Probit regression, and binsqreg for quantile regression). The next two commands focus on pointwise and uniform inference: binstest implements hypothesis testing procedures for parametric specifications and for nonparametric shape restrictions of the unknown regression function, while binspwc implements multi-group pairwise statistical comparisons. Finally, the command binsregselect implements data-driven number of bins selectors. The commands offer binned scatter plots, and allow for covariate adjustment, weighting, clustering, and multi-sample analysis, which is useful when studying treatment effect heterogeneity in randomized and observational studies, among many other features.</description>

      <title>Improved Random Features for Dot Product Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.08712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dot product kernels, such as polynomial and exponential (softmax) kernels, are among the most widely used kernels in machine learning, as they enable modeling the interactions between input features, which is crucial in applications like computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. We make several novel contributions for improving the efficiency of random feature approximations for dot product kernels, to make these kernels more useful in large scale learning. First, we present a generalization of existing random feature approximations for polynomial kernels, such as Rademacher and Gaussian sketches and TensorSRHT, using complex-valued random features. We show empirically that the use of complex features can significantly reduce the variances of these approximations. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis for understanding the factors affecting the efficiency of various random feature approximations, by deriving closed-form expressions for their variances. These variance formulas elucidate conditions under which certain approximations (e.g., TensorSRHT) achieve lower variances than others (e.g., Rademacher sketches), and conditions under which the use of complex features leads to lower variances than real features. Third, by using these variance formulas, which can be evaluated in practice, we develop a data-driven optimization approach to improve random feature approximations for general dot product kernels, which is also applicable to the Gaussian kernel. We describe the improvements brought by these contributions with extensive experiments on a variety of tasks and datasets.</description>

      <title>Targeted Adaptive Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern advanced manufacturing and advanced materials design often require searches of relatively high-dimensional process control parameter spaces for settings that result in optimal structure, property, and performance parameters. The mapping from the former to the latter must be determined from noisy experiments or from expensive simulations. We abstract this problem to a mathematical framework in which an unknown function from a control space to a design space must be ascertained by means of expensive noisy measurements, which locate optimal control settings generating desired design features within specified tolerances, with quantified uncertainty. We describe targeted adaptive design (TAD), a new algorithm that performs this sampling task efficiently. TAD creates a Gaussian process surrogate model of the unknown mapping at each iterative stage, proposing a new batch of control settings to sample experimentally and optimizing the updated log-predictive likelihood of the target design. TAD either stops upon locating a solution with uncertainties that fit inside the tolerance box or uses a measure of expected future information to determine that the search space has been exhausted with no solution. TAD thus embodies the exploration-exploitation tension in a manner that recalls, but is essentially different from, Bayesian optimization and optimal experimental design.</description>

      <title>$\Phi$-DVAE: Physics-Informed Dynamical Variational Autoencoders for Unstructured Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating unstructured data into physical models is a challenging problem that is emerging in data assimilation. Traditional approaches focus on well-defined observation operators whose functional forms are typically assumed to be known. This prevents these methods from achieving a consistent model-data synthesis in configurations where the mapping from data-space to model-space is unknown. To address these shortcomings, in this paper we develop a physics-informed dynamical variational autoencoder ($\Phi$-DVAE) to embed diverse data streams into time-evolving physical systems described by differential equations. Our approach combines a standard, possibly nonlinear, filter for the latent state-space model and a VAE, to assimilate the unstructured data into the latent dynamical system. Unstructured data, in our example systems, comes in the form of video data and velocity field measurements, however the methodology is suitably generic to allow for arbitrary unknown observation operators. A variational Bayesian framework is used for the joint estimation of the encoding, latent states, and unknown system parameters. To demonstrate the method, we provide case studies with the Lorenz-63 ordinary differential equation, and the advection and Korteweg-de Vries partial differential equations. Our results, with synthetic data, show that $\Phi$-DVAE provides a data efficient dynamics encoding methodology which is competitive with standard approaches. Unknown parameters are recovered with uncertainty quantification, and unseen data are accurately predicted.</description>
