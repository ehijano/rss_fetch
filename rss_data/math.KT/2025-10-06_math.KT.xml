      <title>Localising invariants in derived bornological geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study several categories of analytic stacks relative to the category of bornological modules over a Banach ring. When the underlying Banach ring is a non-Archimedean valued field, this category contains derived rigid analytic spaces as a full subcategory. When the underlying field is the complex numbers, it contains the category of derived complex analytic spaces. In the second part of the paper, we consider localising invariants of rigid categories associated to bornological algebras. The main results in this part include Nisnevich descent for derived analytic spaces and a version of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem for derived dagger analytic spaces over an arbitrary Banach ring.</description>

      <title>The six operations in topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the six functor formalism for sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff topological spaces, as developed for example in Kashiwara and Schapira's book Sheaves on Manifolds, can be extended to sheaves with values in any closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category which is stable and bicomplete. Notice that, since we do not assume that our coefficients are presentable or restrict to hypercomplete sheaves, our arguments are not obvious and are substantially different from the ones explained by Kashiwara and Schapira. Along the way we also study locally contractible geometric morphisms and prove that, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a continuous map which induces a locally contractible geometric morphism, then the exceptional pullback functor $f^!$ preserves colimits and can be related to the pullback $f^*$. At the end of our paper we also show how one can express Atiyah duality by means of the six functor formalism.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued multiplicity function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We compute the cohomology of quasi-flag manifolds by constructing their rational algebraic models in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>
