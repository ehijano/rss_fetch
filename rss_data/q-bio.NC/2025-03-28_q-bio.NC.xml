      <title>Brain Age Group Classification Based on Resting State Functional Connectivity Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated age-related changes in functional connectivity using resting-state fMRI and explored the efficacy of traditional deep learning for classifying brain developmental stages (BDS). Functional connectivity was assessed using Seed-Based Phase Synchronization (SBPS) and Pearson correlation across 160 ROIs. Clustering was performed using t-SNE, and network topology was analyzed through graph-theoretic metrics. Adaptive learning was implemented to classify the age group by extracting bottleneck features through mobileNetV2. These deep features were embedded and classified using Random Forest and PCA. Results showed a shift in phase synchronization patterns from sensory-driven networks in youth to more distributed networks with aging. t-SNE revealed that SBPS provided the most distinct clustering of BDS. Global efficiency and participation coefficient followed an inverted U-shaped trajectory, while clustering coefficient and modularity exhibited a U-shaped pattern. MobileNet outperformed other models, achieving the highest classification accuracy for BDS. Aging was associated with reduced global integration and increased local connectivity, indicating functional network reorganization. While this study focused solely on functional connectivity from resting-state fMRI and a limited set of connectivity features, deep learning demonstrated superior classification performance, highlighting its potential for characterizing age-related brain changes.</description>

      <title>Orientation selectivity analysis for integrated affine quasi quadrature models of complex cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the orientation selectivity properties of idealized models of complex cells in terms of affine quasi quadrature measures, which combine the responses of idealized models of simple cells in terms of affine Gaussian derivatives by (i) pointwise squaring, (ii) summation of responses for different orders of spatial derivation and (iii) spatial integration. Specifically, this paper explores the consequences of assuming that the family of spatial receptive fields should be covariant under spatial affine transformations, thereby implying that the receptive fields ought to span a variability over the degree of elongation.
  We investigate the theoretical properties of three main ways of defining idealized models of complex cells and compare the predictions from these models to neurophysiologically obtained receptive field histograms over the resultant of biological orientation selectivity curves. It is shown that the extended modelling mechanism lead to more uniform behaviour and a wider span over the values of the resultat that are covered, compared to earlier presented idealized models of complex cells without spatial integration. More generally, we propose that the presented methodology could be used as a new tool to evaluate other computational models of complex cells in relation to biological measurements.</description>

      <title>In vitro 2 In vivo : Bidirectional and High-Precision Generation of In Vitro and In Vivo Neuronal Spike Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.</description>

      <title>Mapping fMRI Signal and Image Stimuli in an Artificial Neural Network Latent Space: Bringing Artificial and Natural Minds Together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to investigate whether latent space representations of visual stimuli and fMRI data share common information. Decoding and reconstructing stimuli from fMRI data remains a challenge in AI and neuroscience, with significant implications for understanding neural representations and improving the interpretability of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this preliminary study, we investigate the feasibility of such reconstruction by examining the similarity between the latent spaces of one autoencoder (AE) and one vision transformer (ViT) trained on fMRI and image data, respectively. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA), we found that the latent spaces of the two domains appear different. However, these initial findings are inconclusive, and further research is needed to explore this relationship more thoroughly.</description>

      <title>Human Brain State Analysis Unveils Complexity of Brain Dynamics: Insights from General Anesthesia and ADHD EEG signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex system exhibiting rich dynamical behavior across various states, including those induced by anesthesia or neurological disorders. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, our study investigates the underlying complexity and universal patterns in human brain dynamics across states induced by general anesthesia and neurological disorder of inattentive-type attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We extract relative phase dynamics time series, $\beta(t)$, from EEG signals and compute permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity across the different states using the framework of ordinal patterns. Our results reveal several key findings. First, different brain states exhibit distinct PE values, indicating distinct signatures of information content across states. We find an inverse correlation between entropy and the level of consciousness during general anesthesia. Further, when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition, individual, or $\beta(t)$ time series, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics. Moreover, compared to well-known stochastic processes (linear underdamped Langevin dynamics, active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and fractional Brownian motion), brain data consistently exhibits higher complexity for any given PE value. Multifractal analysis shows this enhanced complexity likely arises from greater multifractal scaling properties compared to stochastic processes. Our findings highlight the power of ordinal patterns in distinguishing various dynamic brain states and uncovering hidden universal patterns in brain dynamics. Our comprehensive characterization of human brain complexity across states offers valuable insights for future research into consciousness, attention disorders, and neural information processing.</description>
