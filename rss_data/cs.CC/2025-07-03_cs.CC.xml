      <title>PCPP-Based Reconfiguration Inapproximability: Query Complexity vs. Soundness Gap Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis (RIH), recently established by Hirahara-Ohsaka (STOC'24) and Karthik-Manurangsi (ECCC'24), studies the hardness of reconfiguring one solution into another in constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) when restricted to approximate intermediate solutions. In this work, we make a tighter connection between RIH's soundness gap and that of probabilistically checkable proofs of proximity (PCPP). Consequently, we achieve an improved trade-off between soundness and query complexity in Gap CSP Reconfiguration. Our approach leverages a parallelization framework, which also appears in some recent parameterized inapproximability results.</description>

      <title>Symport/Antiport P Systems with Membrane Separation Characterize P^(#P)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membrane systems represent a computational model that operates in a distributed and parallel manner, inspired by the behavior of biological cells. These systems feature objects that transform within a nested membrane structure. This research concentrates on a specific type of these systems, based on cellular symport/antiport communication of chemicals.
  Results in the literature show that systems of this type that also allow cell division can solve PSPACE problems. In our study, we investigate systems that use membrane separation instead of cell division, for which only limited results are available. Notably, it has been shown that any problem solvable by such systems in polynomial time falls within the complexity class P^(#P).
  By implementing a system solving MIDSAT, a P^(#P)-complete problem, we demonstrate that the reverse inclusion is true as well, thus providing an exact characterization of the problem class solvable by P systems with symport/antiport and membrane separation.
  Moreover, our implementation uses rules of length at most three. With this limit, systems were known to be able to solve NP-complete problems, whereas limiting the rules by length two, they characterize P.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Quantum Distribution Learning and Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer, provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies $PP\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \neq NP$-has long been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to $P \neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution learning can be derived from $PP \neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from $PP \neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite that, we show that $PP \neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \neq BQP$ if and only if agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard. As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\Sigma_3^P}$ learners implies $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Proof Systems for Complex Sets are Hard to Find</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first evidence for the inherent difficulty of finding complex sets with optimal proof systems. For this, we construct oracles $O_1$ and $O_2$ with the following properties, where $\mathrm{RE}$ denotes the class of recursively enumerable sets and $\mathrm{NQP}$ the class of sets accepted in non-deterministic quasi-polynomial time.
  - $O_1$: No set in $\mathrm{PSPACE} \setminus \mathrm{NP}$ has optimal proof systems and $\mathrm{PH}$ is infinite
  - $O_2$: No set in $\mathrm{RE} \setminus \mathrm{NQP}$ has optimal proof systems and $\mathrm{NP} \neq \mathrm{coNP}$
  Oracle $O_2$ is the first relative to which complex sets with optimal proof systems do not exist. By oracle $O_1$, no relativizable proof can show that there exist sets in $\mathrm{PSPACE} \setminus \mathrm{NP}$ with optimal proof systems, even when assuming an infinite $\mathrm{PH}$. By oracle $O_2$, no relativizable proof can show that there exist sets outside $\mathrm{NQP}$ with optimal proof systems, even when assuming $\mathrm{NP} \neq \mathrm{coNP}$. This explains the difficulty of the following longstanding open questions raised by Kraj\'i\v{c}ek and Pudl\'ak in 1989, Sadowski in 1997, K\"obler and Messner in 1998, and Messner in 2000.
  - Q1: Are there sets outside $\mathrm{NP}$ with optimal proof systems?
  - Q2: Are there arbitrarily complex sets outside $\mathrm{NP}$ with optimal proof systems?
  Moreover, relative to $O_2$, there exist arbitrarily complex sets $L \notin \mathrm{NQP}$ having almost optimal algorithms, but none of them has optimal proof systems. This explains the difficulty of Messner's approach to translate almost optimal algorithms into optimal proof systems.</description>

      <title>On $NP \cap coNP$ proof complexity generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of proof complexity generators we consider the following $\Sigma^p_2$ search problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ determined by a propositional proof system $P$: given a $P$-proof $\pi$ of a disjunction $\bigvee_i \alpha_i$, no two $\alpha_i$ having an atom in common, find $i$ such that $\alpha_i \in \mbox{TAUT}$. We formulate a hypothesis (ST) that for some strong proof system $P$ the problem $\mbox{DD}_P$ is not solvable in the student-teacher model with a p-time student and a constant number of rounds. The hypothesis follows from the existence of hard one-way permutations. We prove, using a model-theoretic assumption, that (ST) implies $NP \neq coNP$. The assumption concerns the existence of extensions of models of a bounded arithmetic theory and it is open at present if it holds.</description>

      <title>Nets-within-Nets through the Lens of Data Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elementary Object Systems (EOSs) are a model in the nets-within-nets (NWNs) paradigm, where tokens in turn can host standard Petri nets. We study the complexity of the reachability problem of EOSs when subjected to non-deterministic token losses. It is known that this problem is equivalent to the coverability problem with no lossiness of conservative EOSs (cEOSs). We precisely characterize cEOS coverability into the framework of data nets, whose tokens carry data from an infinite domain. Specifically, we show that cEOS coverability is equivalent to the coverability of an interesting fragment of data nets that extends beyond $\nu$PNs (featuring globally fresh name creation), yet remains less expressive than Unordered Data Nets (featuring lossy name creation as well as powerful forms of whole-place operations and broadcasts). This insight bridges two apparently orthogonal approaches to PN extensions, namely data nets and NWNs. At the same time, it enables us to analyze cEOS coverability taking advantage of known results on data nets. As a byproduct, we immediately get that the complexity of cEOS coverability lies between $\mathbf{F}_{\omega 2}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\omega^\omega}$, two classes beyond Primitive Recursive.</description>

      <title>Minimum Selective Subset on Some Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a connected simple graph G = (V(G),E(G)), each vertex is assigned a color from the set of colors C={1, 2,..., c}. The set of vertices V(G) is partitioned as V_1, V_2, ... ,V_c, where all vertices in V_j share the same color j. A subset S of V(G) is called Selective Subset if, for every vertex v in V(G), and if v is in V_j, at least one of its nearest neighbors in (S union (V(G)\ V_j)) has the same color as v. The Minimum Selective Subset (MSS) problem seeks to find a selective subset of minimum size. The problem was first introduced by Wilfong in 1991 for a set of points in the Euclidean plane, where two major problems, MCS (Minimum Consistent Subset) and MSS, were proposed.
  In graph algorithms, the only known result is that the MSS problem is NP-complete, as shown in 2018. Beyond this, no further progress has been made to date. In contrast, the MCS problem has been widely studied in various graph classes over the years. Therefore, in this work, we also extend the algorithmic study of MSS on various graph classes. We first present a log(n)-approximation algorithm for general graphs with n vertices and regardless of the number of colors. We also show that the problem remains NP-complete in planar graphs when restricted to just two colors.. Finally, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for computing optimal solutions in trees and unit interval graphs for any number of colors.</description>
