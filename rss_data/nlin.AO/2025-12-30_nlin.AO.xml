      <title>Switching Transition in a Resource Exchange Model on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a simple nonequilibrium system with many interconnected, open subsystems, each exchanging a globally conserved resource with an external reserve. The system is represented by a random graph, where nodes represent the subsystems connected through edges. At each time step, a randomly selected node gains a token (i.e, a resource) from the reserve with probability (1-p) or loses a token to the reserve with probability p. When a node loses a token, its neighbors also lose a token each. This asymmetric token exchange breaks the detailed balance. We investigate the steady state behavior of our model for different types of random graphs: graphs without edges, regular graphs, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, and Barab\'asi-Albert graphs. In all cases, the system exhibits a sharp, switch-like transition between a token-saturated state and an empty state. When the control parameter p is below a critical threshold, almost all tokens accumulate on the graph. Furthermore, in a non-regular graph, most tokens accumulate or condense on nodes of minimum degree. A slight increase in p beyond the threshold drains almost all the tokens from the graph. This switching transition results from the interplay between drift and the conservation of tokens. However, the position of the critical threshold and the behavior at the transition zone depend on graph topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum preferential attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum internet is a rapidly developing technological reality, yet, it remains unclear what kind of quantum network structures might emerge. Since indirect quantum communication is already feasible and preserves absolute security of the communication channel, a new node joining the quantum network does not need to connect directly to its desired target. Instead, in our proposed quantum preferential attachment model, it uniformly randomly connects to any node within the proximity of the target, including, but not restricted to, the target itself. This local flexibility is found to qualitatively change the global network behavior, leading to two distinct classes of complex network architectures, both of which are small-world, but neither of which is scale-free. Our numerical findings are supported by rigorous analytic results, in a framework that incorporates quantum and classical variants of preferential attachment in a unified phase diagram. Besides quantum networks, we expect that our results will have broad implications for classical scenarios where there is flexibility in establishing new connections.</description>

      <title>Phase transition revealed by eigen microstate entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the eigen microstate entropy ($S_{\text{EM}}$), a novel metric of complexity derived from the probabilities of statistically independent eigen microstates. After establishing its scaling behavior in equilibrium systems and demonstrating its utility in critical phenomena (mean spherical, Ising, and Potts models), we apply $S_{\text{EM}}$ to non-equilibrium complex systems. Our analysis reveals a consistent precursor signal: a significant increase in $S_{\text{EM}}$ precedes major phase transitions. Specifically, we observe this entropy rise before biomolecular condensate formation in liquid-liquid phase separation in living cells and months ahead of El Ni\~no events. These findings position $S_{\text{EM}}$ as a general framework for detecting and interpreting phase transitions in non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent synchrony in oscillator networks with adaptive arbitrary-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics of complex systems are often driven by interactions that extend beyond pairwise links, underscoring the need to establish a correspondence between interpretable system parameters and emergent phenomena in hypergraph-based networks. The current work formulates an adaptive Kuramoto model that incorporates hyperedges of arbitrary order and explores their effects on synchronization. By deriving the exact order parameter dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, analytical expressions governing the collective dynamics are obtained. Subsequent numerics confirm the analytical predictions, in addition to capturing qualitatively different dynamical regimes and phase transitions. Further investigations based on order parameter distributions demonstrate how fluctuations, arising due to finite system size, can influence the long-term system dynamics. These results provide important insights and can have diverse applications, such as designing optimal surgical procedures for drug-resistant epilepsy and identifying the sources of rumours in a social network.</description>

      <title>Information supercurrents and spin waves in chiral active matter: Universality of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\to S^2$), we show that the polar alignment interaction is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics. This constraint naturally generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. These results classify chiral active matter as a dissipative spintronic fluid, revealing that the transition to active turbulence is the emergence of a topological quasiparticle gas, where macroscopic Onsager dipoles acquire effective inertia from the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.</description>
