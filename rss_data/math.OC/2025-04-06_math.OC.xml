      <title>DualMS: Implicit Dual-Channel Minimal Surface Optimization for Heat Exchanger Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat exchangers are critical components in a wide range of engineering applications, from energy systems to chemical processing, where efficient thermal management is essential. The design objectives for heat exchangers include maximizing the heat exchange rate while minimizing the pressure drop, requiring both a large interface area and a smooth internal structure. State-of-the-art designs, such as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), have proven effective in optimizing heat exchange efficiency. However, TPMS designs are constrained by predefined mathematical equations, limiting their adaptability to freeform boundary shapes. Additionally, TPMS structures do not inherently control flow directions, which can lead to flow stagnation and undesirable pressure drops.
  This paper presents DualMS, a novel computational framework for optimizing dual-channel minimal surfaces specifically for heat exchanger designs in freeform shapes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly optimize minimal surfaces for two-fluid heat exchangers, rather than relying on TPMS. Our approach formulates the heat exchange maximization problem as a constrained connected maximum cut problem on a graph, with flow constraints guiding the optimization process. To address undesirable pressure drops, we model the minimal surface as a classification boundary separating the two fluids, incorporating an additional regularization term for area minimization. We employ a neural network that maps spatial points to binary flow types, enabling it to classify flow skeletons and automatically determine the surface boundary. DualMS demonstrates greater flexibility in surface topology compared to TPMS and achieves superior thermal performance, with lower pressure drops while maintaining a similar heat exchange rate under the same material cost.</description>

      <title>Beyond Smoothness and Convexity: Optimization via sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores a novel perspective on solving nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by leveraging sampling based methods. Instead of treating the objective function purely through traditional (often deterministic) optimization approaches, we view it as inducing a target distribution.We then draw samples from this distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, particularly Langevin Dynamics (LD), to locate regions of low function values. By analyzing the convergence properties of LD in both KL divergence and total variation distance, we establish explicit bounds on how many iterations are required for the induced distribution to approximate the target. We also provide probabilistic guarantees that an appropriately drawn sample will lie within a desired neighborhood of the global minimizer, even when the objective is nonconvex or nonsmooth.</description>

      <title>A novel numerical method tailored for unconstrained optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconstrained optimization problems become more common in scientific computing and engineering applications with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, and numerical methods for solving them more quickly and efficiently have been getting more attention and research. Moreover, an efficient method to minimize all kinds of objective functions is urgently needed, especially the nonsmooth objective function. Therefore, in the current paper, we focus on proposing a novel numerical method tailored for unconstrained optimization problems whether the objective function is smooth or not. To be specific, based on the variational procedure to refine the gradient and Hessian matrix approximations, an efficient quadratic model with $2n$ constrained conditions is established. Moreover, to improve the computational efficiency, a simplified model with 2 constrained conditions is also proposed, where the gradient and Hessian matrix can be explicitly updated, and the corresponding boundedness of the remaining $2n-2$ constrained conditions is derived. On the other hand, the novel numerical method is summarized, and approximation results on derivative information are also analyzed and shown. Numerical experiments involving smooth, derivative blasting, and non-smooth problems are tested, demonstrating its feasibility and efficiency. Compared with existing methods, our proposed method can efficiently solve smooth and non-smooth unconstrained optimization problems for the first time, and it is very easy to program the code, indicating that our proposed method not also has great application prospects, but is also very meaningful to explore practical complex engineering and scientific problems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Min-Max Optimization via Primal-Dual Exact Pareto Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-objective optimization, minimizing the worst objective can be preferable to minimizing the average objective, as this ensures improved fairness across objectives. Due to the non-smooth nature of the resultant min-max optimization problem, classical subgradient-based approaches typically exhibit slow convergence. Motivated by primal-dual consensus techniques in multi-agent optimization and learning, we formulate a smooth variant of the min-max problem based on the augmented Lagrangian. The resultant Exact Pareto Optimization via Augmented Lagrangian (EPO-AL) algorithm scales better with the number of objectives than subgradient-based strategies, while exhibiting lower per-iteration complexity than recent smoothing-based counterparts. We establish that every fixed-point of the proposed algorithm is both Pareto and min-max optimal under mild assumptions and demonstrate its effectiveness in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient First-Order Optimization on the Pareto Set for Multi-Objective Learning under Preference Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective learning under user-specified preference is common in real-world problems such as multi-lingual speech recognition under fairness. In this work, we frame such a problem as a semivectorial bilevel optimization problem, whose goal is to optimize a pre-defined preference function, subject to the constraint that the model parameters are weakly Pareto optimal. To solve this problem, we convert the multi-objective constraints to a single-objective constraint through a merit function with an easy-to-evaluate gradient, and then, we use a penalty-based reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem. We theoretically establish the properties of the merit function, and the relations of solutions for the penalty reformulation and the constrained formulation. Then we propose algorithms to solve the reformulated single-level problem, and establish its convergence guarantees. We test the method on various synthetic and real-world problems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding preference-guided optimal solutions to the multi-objective problem.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Line Balancing for the Aluminium Melting Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research article explores the optimization of aluminium extrusion processes through advanced line balancing techniques, focusing on maximizing marginal profit by increasing melting and casting outputs. By employing mixed integer linear programming (MILP), we identify strategies to minimize idle costs and enhance production efficiency. The study demonstrates that increasing the daily cycle rate from 2 to 4.36 cycles results in a significant rise in daily marginal profit, calculated at USD67,786, after accounting for additional labour costs. This optimization is achieved by expanding the workforce from 8 to 12 operators across two shifts, leading to a 50% increase in labour expenses. The findings reveal a remarkable 117.6% growth in marginal daily profit, underscoring the potential of automation and intelligent manufacturing in transforming the aluminium extrusion industry. Insights from cross-industry research, including Lean Methodology in the Modern Garment Industry, further illustrate the broader applicability of these advancements. This study highlights the critical role of automation in driving productivity and profitability in manufacturing sectors, paving the way for future innovations in aluminium extrusion and beyond.</description>

      <title>Efficient search strategies for constrained multiobjective blackbox optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiobjective blackbox optimization deals with problems where the objective and constraint functions are the outputs of a numerical simulation. In this context, no derivatives are available, nor can they be approximated by finite differences, which precludes the use of classical gradient-based techniques. The DMulti-MADS algorithm implements a state-of-the-art direct search procedure for multiobjective blackbox optimization based on the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm. Since its conception, many search strategies have been proposed to improve the practical efficiency of the single-objective MADS algorithm. Inspired by this previous research, this work proposes the integration of two search heuristics into the DMulti-MADS algorithm. The first uses quadratic models, built from previously evaluated points, which act as surrogates for the true objectives and constraints, to suggest new promising candidates. The second exploits the sampling strategy of the Nelder-Mead algorithm to explore the decision space for new non-dominated points. Computational experiments on analytical problems and three engineering applications show that the use of such search steps considerably improves the performance of the DMulti-MADS algorithm.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Optimization with Complex Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems involving complex variables, when solved, are typically transformed into real variables, often at the expense of convergence rate and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel formalism for a prominent problem in stochastic optimization involving complex random variables, termed the Complex Chance-Constrained Problem (CCCP). The study specifically examines the linear CCCP under complex normal distributions for two scenarios: one with individual probabilistic constraints and the other with joint probabilistic constraints. For the individual case, the core methodology reformulates the CCCP into a deterministic Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP) problem, ensuring equivalence to the original CCCP. For the joint case, an approximation is achieved by deriving suitable upper and lower bounds, which also leads to a SOCP formulation. Finally, numerical experiments on a signal processing application, specifically the Minimum Variance Beamforming problem with mismatch using MVDR, demonstrate that the proposed formalism outperforms existing approaches in the literature. A comparative analysis between the joint and individual CCCP cases is also included.</description>

      <title>Properties of Fixed Points of Generalised Extra Gradient Methods Applied to Min-Max Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies properties of fixed points of generalised Extra-gradient (GEG) algorithms applied to min-max problems. We discuss connections between saddle points of the objective function of the min-max problem and GEG fixed points. We show that, under appropriate step-size selections, the set of saddle points (Nash equilibria) is a subset of stable fixed points of GEG. Convergence properties of the GEG algorithm are obtained through a stability analysis of a discrete-time dynamical system. The results and benefits when compared to existing methods are illustrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Optimally Linearizing Power Flow Equations for Improved Power System Dispatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing power grids with the increasing presence of variable renewable energy-based (distributed) generation involves solving high-dimensional optimization tasks at short intervals. Linearizing the AC power flow (PF) constraints is a standard practice to ease the computational burden at the cost of hopefully acceptable inaccuracies. However, the design of these PF linearizations has traditionally been agnostic of the use case. Towards bridging the linearization-application gap, we first model the complete operational sequence needed to implement optimal power flow (OPF) decisions on power systems and characterize the effect of PF linearization on the resulting steady-state system operation. We then propose a novel formulation for obtaining optimal PF constraint linearizations to harness desirable system-operation attributes such as low generation cost and engineering-limit violations. To pursue the optimal PF linearization, we develop a gradient-based approach backed by sensitivity analysis of optimization routines and AC PF equations. Numerical tests on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in traversing the cost-optimality vs operational feasibility trade-off inherent to OPF approximations.</description>

      <title>An ADMM Algorithm for Structure Learning in Equilibrium Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the edge connectivity structure of networked systems from limited data is a fundamental challenge in many critical infrastructure domains, including power, traffic, and finance. Such systems obey steady-state conservation laws: $x(t) = Ly(t)$, where $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ and $y(t) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ represent injected flows (inputs) and potentials (outputs), respectively. The sparsity pattern of the $p\times p$ Laplacian L encodes the underlying edge structure. In a stochastic setting, the goal is to infer this sparsity pattern from zero-mean i.i.d. samples of y(t).
  Recent work by Rayas et al. [1] has established statistical consistency results for this learning problem by considering an $\ell_1$-regularized maximum likelihood estimator. However, their approach did not focus on developing a scalable algorithm but relies on solving a convex program via the CVX package in Python. To address this gap, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Our approach is simple, transparent, and computationally fast. A key contribution is demonstrating the role of a non-symmetric algebraic Riccati equation in the primal step of ADMM. Numerical experiments on a host of synthetic and benchmark networks, including power and water systems, show that our method achieves high recovery accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Ground Cost for Optimal Transport of Angular Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the optimal transport problem over angular velocity dynamics given by the controlled Euler equation. The solution of this problem enables stochastic guidance of spin states of a rigid body (e.g., spacecraft) over hard deadline constraint by transferring a given initial state statistics to a desired terminal state statistics. This is an instance of generalized optimal transport over a nonlinear dynamical system. While prior work has reported existence-uniqueness and numerical solution of this dynamical optimal transport problem, here we present structural results about the equivalent Kantorovich a.k.a. optimal coupling formulation. Specifically, we focus on deriving the ground cost for the associated Kantorovich optimal coupling formulation. The ground cost equals to the cost of transporting unit amount of mass from a specific realization of the initial or source joint probability measure to a realization of the terminal or target joint probability measure, and determines the Kantorovich formulation. Finding the ground cost leads to solving a structured deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem, which is shown to be amenable to an analysis technique pioneered by Athans et. al. We show that such techniques have broader applicability in determining the ground cost (thus Kantorovich formulation) for a class of generalized optimal mass transport problems involving nonlinear dynamics with translated norm-invariant drift.</description>

      <title>Extending Exact SDP Relaxations of Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semidefinite (SDP) relaxation of a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) is called exact if it has a rank-$1$ optimal solution corresponding to a QCQP optimal solution. Given an arbitrary QCQP whose SDP relaxation is exact, this paper investigates incorporating additional quadratic inequality constraints while maintaining the exactness of the SDP relaxation of the resulting QCQP. Three important classes of QCQPs with exact SDP relaxations include (a) those characterized by rank-one generated cones, (b) those by convexity, and (c) those by the sign pattern of the data coefficient matrices. These classes have been studied independently until now. By adding quadratic inequality constraints satisfying the proposed conditions to QCQPs in these classes, we extend the exact SDP relaxation to broader classes of QCQPs. Illustrative QCQP instances are provided.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Variational Inequality Problem for Noncooperative Game-theoretic Selection of Generalized Nash Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium selection problem in the variational Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (v-GNEP) has been reported as an optimization problem defined over the solution set of v-GNEP, called in this paper the lower-level v-GNEP. However, to make such a selection fair for every player, we have to rely on an unrealistic assumption, that is, the availability of a trusted center that does not induce any bias among players. In this paper, to ensure fairness for every player even in the process of equilibrium selection, we propose a new equilibrium selection problem, named the upper-level v-GNEP. The proposed upper-level v-GNEP is formulated as a v-GNEP defined over the solution set of the lower-level v-GNEP. We also present an iterative algorithm, of guaranteed convergence to a solution of the upper-level v-GNEP, as an application of the hybrid steepest descent method to a fixed point set characterization of the solution of the lower-level v-GNEP. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed equilibrium selection and algorithm.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of a Constant Quaternion Difference Attitude Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is quite often claimed, and correctly so, that linear methods cannot achieve global stability results for attitude control, and conversely that nonlinear control is essential in order to achieve (almost) globally stable tracking of general attitude trajectories. On account of this definitive result, and also because of the existence of powerful nonlinear control techniques, there has been relatively very little work analyzing the limits and performance of linear attitude control. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a characterization of the stability achievable for one class of linear attitude control problems, namely those leading to a constant quaternion difference. In this paper, we analytically derive a critical error angle below which linearized dynamics lead to natural marginal stability for such a system, and above which the system is unstable. The dynamics are then used to derive a locally stable linear attitude controller whose performance is validated using simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamical Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Relaxation and Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a generalized dynamical unbalanced optimal transport framework by incorporating limited control input and mass dissipation, addressing limitations in conventional optimal transport for control applications. We derive a convex dual of the problem using dual optimal control techniques developed before and during the 1990s, transforming the non-convex optimization into a more tractable form.At the core of this formulation is the smooth sub-solutions to an HJB equation. A first-order algorithm based on the dual formulation is proposed to solve the problem numerically.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control of Drawdowns via Reinsurance under Random Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a diffusion risk model where proportional reinsurance can be bought. In order to stabilise the surplus process, one tries to keep the drawdown, that is the difference of the surplus to its historical maximum, in an interval $[0,d)$. The observation times of the drawdowns form a renewal process. The retention levels can only be changed at the observation times either. We show that an optimal strategy exists and how it is determined. We illustrate the findings in the case of Poissonian observation times and deterministic inter-observation times.</description>

      <title>An existence theorem for single leader multi-follower games with direct preference maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns with an existence of a solution for a single leader multi-follower game (SLMFG), where the followers jointly solve an abstract economy problem. Recall that an abstract economy problem is an extension of a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) in the sense that the preference of each player can be described without numerical criteria. The results of this paper therefore extend the known literature concerning an existence of a solution of a SLMFG. Due to the lack of criterion functions in the lower-level, the technique we used is quite different from those that deal with GNEPs. In particular, we argue that the follower's abstract economy profiles, {\itshape i.e.,} constraint-preference couples, belong to a particular metric space where the response map is proved to be upper semicontinuous.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Variational Inequalities under the Minty Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving (Stampacchia) variational inequalities (SVIs) is a foundational problem at the heart of optimization, with a host of critical applications ranging from engineering to economics. However, this expressivity comes at the cost of computational hardness. As a result, most research has focused on carving out specific subclasses that elude those intractability barriers. A classical property that goes back to the 1960s is the Minty condition, which postulates that the Minty VI (MVI) problem -- the weak dual of the SVI problem -- admits a solution.
  In this paper, we establish the first polynomial-time algorithm -- that is, with complexity growing polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\log(1/\epsilon)$ -- for solving $\epsilon$-SVIs for Lipschitz continuous mappings under the Minty condition. Prior approaches either incurred an exponentially worse dependence on $1/\epsilon$ (and other natural parameters of the problem) or made overly restrictive assumptions -- such as strong monotonicity. To do so, we introduce a new variant of the ellipsoid algorithm wherein separating hyperplanes are obtained after taking a gradient descent step from the center of the ellipsoid. It succeeds even though the set of SVIs can be nonconvex and not fully dimensional. Moreover, when our algorithm is applied to an instance with no MVI solution and fails to identify an SVI solution, it produces a succinct certificate of MVI infeasibility. We also show that deciding whether the Minty condition holds is $\mathsf{coNP}$-complete.
  We provide several extensions and new applications of our main results. Specifically, we obtain the first polynomial-time algorithms for i) solving monotone VIs, ii) globally minimizing a (potentially nonsmooth) quasar-convex function, and iii) computing Nash equilibria in multi-player harmonic games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an analytical approach for the synthesis of ellipsoidal probabilistic reachable sets of saturated systems subject to unbounded additive noise. Using convex optimization methods, we compute a contraction factor of the saturated error dynamics that allows us to tightly bound its evolution and therefore construct accurate reachable sets. The proposed approach is applicable to independent, zero mean disturbances with a known covariance. A numerical example illustrates the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed design.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization with Optimal Importance Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Importance Sampling (IS) is a widely used variance reduction technique for enhancing the efficiency of Monte Carlo methods, particularly in rare-event simulation and related applications. Despite its power, the performance of IS is often highly sensitive to the choice of the proposal distribution and frequently requires stochastic calibration techniques. While the design and analysis of IS have been extensively studied in estimation settings, applying IS within stochastic optimization introduces a unique challenge: the decision and the IS distribution are mutually dependent, creating a circular optimization structure. This interdependence complicates both the analysis of convergence for decision iterates and the efficiency of the IS scheme. In this paper, we propose an iterative gradient-based algorithm that jointly updates the decision variable and the IS distribution without requiring time-scale separation between the two. Our method achieves the lowest possible asymptotic variance and guarantees global convergence under convexity of the objective and mild assumptions on the IS distribution family. Furthermore, we show that these properties are preserved under linear constraints by incorporating a recent variant of Nesterov's dual averaging method.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Online Learning in Symmetric Cone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimistic online learning algorithms have led to significant advances in equilibrium computation, particularly for two-player zero-sum games, achieving an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ to reach an $\epsilon$-saddle point. These advances have been established in normal-form games, where strategies are simplex vectors, and quantum games, where strategies are trace-one positive semidefinite matrices. We extend optimistic learning to symmetric cone games (SCGs), a class of two-player zero-sum games where strategy spaces are generalized simplices (trace-one slices of symmetric cones). A symmetric cone is the cone of squares of a Euclidean Jordan Algebra; canonical examples include the nonnegative orthant, the second-order cone, the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, and their products, all fundamental to convex optimization. SCGs unify normal-form and quantum games and, as we show, offer significantly greater modeling flexibility, allowing us to model applications such as distance metric learning problems and the Fermat-Weber problem. To compute approximate saddle points in SCGs, we introduce the Optimistic Symmetric Cone Multiplicative Weights Update algorithm and establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ to reach an $\epsilon$-saddle point. Our analysis builds on the Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework, with a key technical contribution being a new proof of the strong convexity of the symmetric cone negative entropy with respect to the trace-one norm, a result that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>ReMU: Regional Minimal Updating for Model-Based Derivative-Free Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Derivative-free optimization (DFO) problems are optimization problems where derivative information is unavailable or extremely difficult to obtain. Model-based DFO solvers have been applied extensively in scientific computing. Powell's NEWUOA (2004) and Wild's POUNDerS (2014) explore the numerical power of the minimal norm Hessian (MNH) model for DFO and contributed to the open discussion on building better models with fewer data to achieve faster numerical convergence. Another decade later, we propose the regional minimal updating (ReMU) models, and extend the previous models into a broader class. This paper shows motivation behind ReMU models, computational details, theoretical and numerical results on particular extreme points and the barycenter of ReMU's weight coefficient region, and the associated KKT matrix error and distance. Novel metrics, such as the truncated Newton step error, are proposed to numerically understand the new models' properties. A new algorithmic strategy, based on iteratively adjusting the ReMU model type, is also proposed, and shows numerical advantages by combining and switching between the barycentric model and the classic least Frobenius norm model in an online fashion.</description>

      <title>Dual Averaging With Non-Strongly-Convex Prox-Functions: New Analysis and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new analysis and algorithm of the dual-averaging-type (DA-type) methods for solving the composite convex optimization problem ${\min}_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n} \, f(\mathsf{A} x) + h(x)$, where $f$ is a convex and globally Lipschitz function, $\mathsf{A}$ is a linear operator, and $h$ is a ``simple'' and convex function that is used as the prox-function in the DA-type methods. We open new avenues of analyzing and developing DA-type methods, by going beyond the canonical setting where the prox-function $h$ is assumed to be strongly convex (on its domain). To that end, we identify two new sets of assumptions on $h$ (and $f$) and show that they hold broadly for many important classes of non-strongly-convex functions. Under the first set of assumptions, we show that the original DA method still has a $O(1/k)$ primal-dual convergence rate. Moreover, we analyze the affine invariance of this method and its convergence rate. Under the second set of assumptions, we develop a new DA-type method with dual monotonicity, and show that it has a $O(1/k)$ primal-dual convergence rate. Finally, we consider the case where $f$ is only convex and Lipschitz on $\mathcal{C}:=\mathsf{A}(\mathsf{dom} h)$, and construct its globally convex and Lipschitz extension based on the Pasch-Hausdorff envelope. Furthermore, we characterize the sub-differential and Fenchel conjugate of this extension using the convex analytic objects associated with $f$ and $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study bifurcations of attractors of the H\'enon map with additive bounded noise with spherical reach. The bifurcations are analysed using a finite-dimensional boundary map. We distinguish between two types of bifurcations: topological bifurcations and boundary bifurcations. Topological bifurcations describe discontinuous changes of attractors and boundary bifurcations occur when singularities of an attractor's boundary are created or destroyed. We identify correspondences between topological and boundary bifurcations of attractors and local and global bifurcations of the boundary map.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and computing solutions to regularized semi-discrete optimal transport via an ordinary differential equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semi-discrete optimal transport (OT) problem with entropic regularization. We characterize the solution using a governing, well-posed ordinary differential equation (ODE). This naturally yields an algorithm to solve the problem numerically, which we prove has desirable properties, notably including global strong convexity of a value function whose Hessian must be inverted in the numerical scheme. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to validate our approach. We compare the solutions obtained using the ODE method with those derived from Newton's method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive for problems involving the squared Euclidean distance and exhibits superior performance when applied to various powers of the Euclidean distance. Finally, we note that the ODE approach yields an estimate on the rate of convergence of the solution as the regularization parameter vanishes, for a generic cost function.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Optimal Transport with Optimal Preferential Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a dynamic optimal transport type problem on a domain that consists of two parts: a compact set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ (bulk) and a non-intersecting and sufficiently regular curve $\Gamma \subset \Omega$. On each of them, a Benamou-Brenier type dynamic optimal transport problem is considered, yet with an additional mechanism that allows the exchange (at a cost) of mass between bulk and curve. In the respective actions, we also allow for non-linear mobilities. We first ensure the existence of minimizers by relying on the direct method of calculus of variations and we study the asymptotic properties of the minimizers under changes in the parameters regulating the dynamics in $\Omega$ and $\Gamma$.
  Then, we study the case when the curve $\Gamma$ is also allowed to change, being the main interest in this paper. To this end, the Tangent-Point energy is added to the action functional in order to preserve the regularity properties of the curve and prevent self-intersections. Also in this case, by relying on suitable compactness estimates both for the time-dependent measures and the curve $\Gamma$, the existence of optimizers is shown.
  We extend these analytical findings by numerical simulations based on a primal-dual approach that illustrate the behaviour of geodesics, for fixed and varying curves.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sizing and Material Choice for Additively Manufactured Compact Plate Heat Exchangers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) capabilities, new opportunities arise to design compact heat exchangers (cHEXs) that leverage AM's degrees of freedom (DOFs) to enhance energy and material efficiency. However, excessive size reduction in counterflow cHEXs can compromise effectiveness due to axial heat conduction through the solid material, influenced by thermal conductivity and wall thickness. This study investigates how AM material selection and thin-wall production limitations might constrain the core size of counterflow plate heat exchangers when targeting maximum power density. An optimization framework evaluates power densities for six materials: plastic, austenitic steel, Al2O3, AlN, aluminum, and copper. Evaluations are conducted under constant effectiveness and pressure drop while accounting for AM-specific plate thickness limits and a lower bound on plate spacing to address fouling. Across all scenarios, copper cHEXs exhibit the lowest power density, despite high thermal conductivity. Without constraints on plate thickness and spacing, the optimal plastic cHEX achieves a power density 1800x greater than the steel baseline, while copper decreases by a factor of 0.98. With equal plate thickness of 0.5 mm for all materials, plastic retains the highest power density, 12.2x more than copper. Introducing a fouling constraint of 0.8 mm plate spacing shifts the optimal material to austenitic steel. When material-specific plate thicknesses are considered, the plastic cHEX achieves the highest power density, five times greater than copper, due to superior thin-wall resolution. This study highlights the impact of AM constraints on the energy and material efficiency of cHEXs, and shows that low-conductivity materials like plastic or austenitic steel can outperform high-conductivity materials like copper in compact designs.</description>

      <title>Online Traffic Density Estimation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works on the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to traffic density estimation have shown to be promising for future developments due to their robustness to model errors and noisy data. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for online approximation of the traffic density using measurements from probe vehicles in two settings: one using the Greenshield model and the other considering a high-fidelity traffic simulation. The proposed method continuously estimates the real-time traffic density in space and performs model identification with each new set of measurements. The density estimate is updated in almost real-time using gradient descent and adaptive weights. In the case of full model knowledge, the resulting algorithm has similar performance to the classical open-loop one. However, in the case of model mismatch, the iterative solution behaves as a closed-loop observer and outperforms the baseline method. Similarly, in the high-fidelity setting, the proposed algorithm correctly reproduces the traffic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedups for Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods with Application to Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose quantum algorithms that provide provable speedups for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods commonly used for sampling from probability distributions of the form $\pi \propto e^{-f}$, where $f$ is a potential function. Our first approach considers Gibbs sampling for finite-sum potentials in the stochastic setting, employing an oracle that provides gradients of individual functions. In the second setting, we consider access only to a stochastic evaluation oracle, allowing simultaneous queries at two points of the potential function under the same stochastic parameter. By introducing novel techniques for stochastic gradient estimation, our algorithms improve the gradient and evaluation complexities of classical samplers, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) in terms of dimension, precision, and other problem-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we achieve quantum speedups in optimization, particularly for minimizing non-smooth and approximately convex functions that commonly appear in empirical risk minimization problems.</description>

      <title>The Performance of MBFGS with Different Inexact Line Search Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modified BFGS optimization algorithm is generally used when the objective function is non-convex. In this method, one has to move in a specific direction such that the value of the objective function reduces. Therefore, the different inexact line search or exact line search plays an important role in optimization. Here, we have studied Modified BFGS with different inexact line searches methods and compared them in some test problems. Numerical results show that MBFGS with Armijo line search methods is efficient for solving non-convex non-linear unconstrained optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Modified limited memory BFGS with displacement aggregation and its application to the largest eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified limited memory BFGS method with displacement aggregation (AggMBFGS) for solving nonconvex optimization problems. AggMBFGS refines curvature pair updates by removing linearly dependent variable variations, ensuring that the inverse Hessian approximation retains essential curvature properties. As a result, its per iteration complexity and storage requirement is $\mathcal{O}(\tau d)$ where $\tau \leq d$ represents the memory size and $d$ is the problem dimension. We establish the global convergence of both M-LBFGS and AggMBFGS under a backtracking modified Armijo line search (MALS) and prove the local superlinear convergence of AggMBFGS, demonstrating its theoretical advantages over M-LBFGS with the classical Armijo line search~\cite{Shi2016ALM}. Numerical experiments on CUTEst test problems~\cite{gould2015cutest} confirm that AggMBFGS outperforms M-LBFGS in reducing the number of iterations and function evaluations. Additionally, we apply AggMBFGS to compute the largest eigenvalue of high-dimensional real symmetric positive definite matrices, achieving lower relative errors than M-LBFGS~\cite{Shi2016ALM} while maintaining computational efficiency. These results suggest that AggMBFGS is a promising alternative for large-scale nonconvex optimization and eigenvalue computation.</description>

      <title>The Internal Model Principle of Time-Varying Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-varying optimization problems are central to many engineering applications, where performance metrics and system constraints evolve dynamically with time. Several algorithms have been proposed to address these problems; a common characteristic among them is their implicit reliance on knowledge of the optimizers' temporal variability. In this paper, we provide a fundamental characterization of this property: we show that an algorithm can track time-varying optimizers if and only if it incorporates a model of the temporal variability of the optimization problem. We refer to this concept as the internal model principle of time-varying optimization. Our analysis relies on showing that time-varying optimization problems can be recast as output regulation problems and, by using tools from center manifold theory, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact asymptotic tracking. As a result, these findings enable the design of new algorithms for time-varying optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through numerical experiments on both synthetic problems and the dynamic traffic assignment problem from traffic control.</description>

      <title>Taxicab distance based best-worst method for multi-criteria decision-making: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Best-Worst Method (BWM) is a well-known distance based multi-criteria decision-making method used for computing the weights of decision criteria. This article examines a taxicab distance based model of the BWM, with the objective of developing a framework for deriving the model's optimal weights by solving its associated optimization problem analytically. To achieve this, an optimal modification based optimization problem, equivalent to the original one, is first formulated. This reformulated problem is then solved analytically, and the optimal weight sets are derived from its solutions. Contrary to existing literature that asserts the uniqueness of optimal weight sets based on numerical examples, our findings reveal that, in some cases, the taxicab BWM leads to multiple optimal weight sets. A mixed-integer linear programming model is then employed to compute the consistency index. This framework provides a solid mathematical foundation that enhances understanding of the model. It also eliminates the requirement for optimization software, improving the model's precision and efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>An Adaptively Inexact Method for Bilevel Learning Using Primal-Dual Style Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bilevel learning framework for learning linear operators. In this framework, the learnable parameters are optimized via a loss function that also depends on the minimizer of a convex optimization problem (denoted lower-level problem). We utilize an iterative algorithm called `piggyback' to compute the gradient of the loss and minimizer of the lower-level problem. Given that the lower-level problem is solved numerically, the loss function and thus its gradient can only be computed inexactly. To estimate the accuracy of the computed hypergradient, we derive an a-posteriori error bound, which provides guides for setting the tolerance for the lower-level problem, as well as the piggyback algorithm. To efficiently solve the upper-level optimization, we also propose an adaptive method for choosing a suitable step-size. To illustrate the proposed method, we consider a few learned regularizer problems, such as training an input-convex neural network.</description>

      <title>The Price of Simplicity: Analyzing Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the performance cost of using simple, decoupled control policies in inherently coupled systems? Motivated by industrial refrigeration systems, where centralized compressors exhibit economies of scale yet traditional control employs decoupled room-by-room temperature regulation, we address this question through the lens of multi-location inventory control. Here, a planner manages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs that are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing that optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain unchanged despite the coupling when restricting attention to decoupled strategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies relative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio depends primarily on the degree of nonlinearity in the cost function and scales with the number of locations for systems with fixed costs; and (iii) analysis of practical online algorithms that achieve competitive performance without solving complex dynamic programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that while decoupled policies significantly outperform their worst-case guarantees in typical scenarios, they still exhibit meaningful suboptimality compared to fully coordinated strategies. These results provide actionable guidance for system operators navigating the trade-off between control complexity and operational efficiency in coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed AC Optimal Power Flow: A Scalable Solution for Large-Scale Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Control of General Linear Delay Systems under Dissipativity: Part I -- A KSD based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an effective framework for designing memoryless dissipative full-state feedbacks for general linear delay systems via the Krasovski\u{i} functional (KF) approach, where an unlimited number of pointwise and general distributed delays (DDs) exists in the state, input and output. To handle the infinite dimensionality of DDs, we employ the Kronecker-Seuret Decomposition (KSD) which we recently proposed for analyzing matrix-valued functions in the context of delay systems. The KSD enables factorization or least-squares approximation of any number of $\mathcal{L}^2$ DD kernels from any number of DDs without introducing conservatism. This also facilitates the construction of a complete-type KF with flexible integral kernels, following from an application of a novel integral inequality derived from the least-squares principle. Our solution includes two theorems and an iterative algorithm to compute controller gains without relying on nonlinear solvers. A challenging numerical example, intractable for existing methods, underscores the efficacy of this approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-agent Coordination over Cellular Sheaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Techniques for coordination of multi-agent systems are vast and varied, often utilizing purpose-built solvers or controllers with tight coupling to the types of systems involved or the coordination goal. In this paper, we introduce a general unified framework for heterogeneous multi-agent coordination using the language of cellular sheaves and nonlinear sheaf Laplacians, which are generalizations of graphs and graph Laplacians. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a nonlinear homological program encompassing a choice of cellular sheaf on an undirected graph, nonlinear edge potential functions, and constrained convex node objectives, which constitutes a standard form for a wide class of coordination problems. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers to derive a distributed optimization algorithm for solving these nonlinear homological programs. To demonstrate the applicability of this framework, we show how heterogeneous coordination goals including combinations of consensus, formation, and flocking can be formulated as nonlinear homological programs and provide numerical simulations showing the efficacy of our distributed solution algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Physical systems with symmetry arise abundantly in applications, and are endowed with interesting mathematical structures. The present paper focusses on linear reciprocal and input-output Hamiltonian systems. Their characterization is studied from an input-output as well as from a state point of view. Geometrically, it turns out that they both define Lagrangian subspaces with corresponding generating functionals. Furthermore, the relations with time reversibility are analyzed. The system classes under consideration are expected to admit scalable control laws, and to be important building blocks in design.</description>

      <title>Can Learning Be Explained By Local Optimality In Robust Low-rank Matrix Recovery?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the local landscape of low-rank matrix recovery, focusing on reconstructing a $d_1\times d_2$ matrix $X^\star$ with rank $r$ from $m$ linear measurements, some potentially noisy. When the noise is distributed according to an outlier model, minimizing a nonsmooth $\ell_1$-loss with a simple sub-gradient method can often perfectly recover the ground truth matrix $X^\star$. Given this, a natural question is what optimization property (if any) enables such learning behavior. The most plausible answer is that the ground truth $X^\star$ manifests as a local optimum of the loss function. In this paper, we provide a strong negative answer to this question, showing that, under moderate assumptions, the true solutions corresponding to $X^\star$ do not emerge as local optima, but rather as strict saddle points -- critical points with strictly negative curvature in at least one direction. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that all strict saddle points are undesirable and should be avoided.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Policy Gradient Primal-Dual Methods for Continuous-Space Constrained MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing deterministic optimal policies for constrained Markov decision processes (MDPs) with continuous state and action spaces, which are widely encountered in constrained dynamical systems. Designing deterministic policy gradient methods in continuous state and action spaces is particularly challenging due to the lack of enumerable state-action pairs and the adoption of deterministic policies, hindering the application of existing policy gradient methods. To this end, we develop a deterministic policy gradient primal-dual method to find an optimal deterministic policy with non-asymptotic convergence. Specifically, we leverage regularization of the Lagrangian of the constrained MDP to propose a deterministic policy gradient primal-dual (D-PGPD) algorithm that updates the deterministic policy via a quadratic-regularized gradient ascent step and the dual variable via a quadratic-regularized gradient descent step. We prove that the primal-dual iterates of D-PGPD converge at a sub-linear rate to an optimal regularized primal-dual pair. We instantiate D-PGPD with function approximation and prove that the primal-dual iterates of D-PGPD converge at a sub-linear rate to an optimal regularized primal-dual pair, up to a function approximation error. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in two continuous control problems: robot navigation and fluid control. This appears to be the first work that proposes a deterministic policy search method for continuous-space constrained MDPs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ptychography Reconstruction using the Hessian operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a powerful and robust coherent imaging method providing access to the complex object and probe (illumination). Ptychography reconstruction is typically performed using first-order methods due to their computational efficiency. Higher-order methods, while potentially more accurate, are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. In this study, we present a mathematical framework for reconstruction using second-order information, derived from an efficient computation of the bilinear Hessian and Hessian operator. The formulation is provided for Gaussian based models, enabling the simultaneous reconstruction of the object, probe, and object positions. Synthetic data tests, along with experimental near-field ptychography data processing, demonstrate a ten-fold reduction in computation time compared to first-order methods. The derived formulas for computing the Hessians, along with the strategies for incorporating them into optimization schemes, are well-structured and easily adaptable to various ptychography problem formulations.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Structured Sparse PCA via Deep Unfolding Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse principal component analysis (PCA) is a well-established dimensionality reduction technique that is often used for unsupervised feature selection (UFS). However, determining the regularization parameters is rather challenging, and conventional approaches, including grid search and Bayesian optimization, not only bring great computational costs but also exhibit high sensitivity. To address these limitations, we first establish a structured sparse PCA formulation by integrating $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_{2,1}$-norm to capture the local and global structures, respectively. Building upon the off-the-shelf alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization framework, we then design an interpretable deep unfolding network that translates iterative optimization steps into trainable neural architectures. This innovation enables automatic learning of the regularization parameters, effectively bypassing the empirical tuning requirements of conventional methods. Numerical experiments on benchmark datasets validate the advantages of our proposed method over the existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be accessible at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/SPCA-Net.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, solutions to these PDEs often do not converge to a unique equilibrium, but instead converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in the nullspace of the spatial differential operator (e.g. $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$). To analyse this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how such trajectories can be modeled for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any PDE state satisfying these boundary conditions can be uniquely expressed in terms of two components, existing in the image and the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$, respectively. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both state components. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined that requires only one of the state components to converge to zero, and it is shown how this stability notion can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that exponential stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of decay.</description>
