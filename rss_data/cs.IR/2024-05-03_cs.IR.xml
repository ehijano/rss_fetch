      <title>Efficient and Responsible Adaptation of Large Language Models for Robust Top-k Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional recommendation systems (RSs) are typically optimized to enhance performance metrics uniformly across all training samples.
  This makes it hard for data-driven RSs to cater to a diverse set of users due to the varying properties of these users. The performance disparity among various populations can harm the model's robustness with respect to sub-populations. While recent works have shown promising results in adapting large language models (LLMs) for recommendation to address hard samples, long user queries from millions of users can degrade the performance of LLMs and elevate costs, processing times and inference latency. This challenges the practical applicability of LLMs for recommendations. To address this, we propose a hybrid task allocation framework that utilizes the capabilities of both LLMs and traditional RSs. By adopting a two-phase approach to improve robustness to sub-populations, we promote a strategic assignment of tasks for efficient and responsible adaptation of LLMs. Our strategy works by first identifying the weak and inactive users that receive a suboptimal ranking performance by RSs. Next, we use an in-context learning approach for such users, wherein each user interaction history is contextualized as a distinct ranking task and given to an LLM. We test our hybrid framework by incorporating various recommendation algorithms -- collaborative filtering and learning-to-rank recommendation models -- and two LLMs -- both open and close-sourced. Our results on three real-world datasets show a significant reduction in weak users and improved robustness of RSs to sub-populations $(\approx12\%)$ and overall performance without disproportionately escalating costs.</description>

      <title>PLAID SHIRTTT for Large-Scale Streaming Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLAID, an efficient implementation of the ColBERT late interaction bi-encoder using pretrained language models for ranking, consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in monolingual, cross-language, and multilingual retrieval. PLAID differs from ColBERT by assigning terms to clusters and representing those terms as cluster centroids plus compressed residual vectors. While PLAID is effective in batch experiments, its performance degrades in streaming settings where documents arrive over time because representations of new tokens may be poorly modeled by the earlier tokens used to select cluster centroids. PLAID Streaming Hierarchical Indexing that Runs on Terabytes of Temporal Text (PLAID SHIRTTT) addresses this concern using multi-phase incremental indexing based on hierarchical sharding. Experiments on ClueWeb09 and the multilingual NeuCLIR collection demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach both for the largest collection indexed to date by the ColBERT architecture and in the multilingual setting, respectively.</description>

      <title>Distillation for Multilingual Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are in different languages, has shown the benefit of the Translate-Distill framework that trains a cross-language neural dual-encoder model using translation and distillation. However, Translate-Distill only supports a single document language. Multilingual information retrieval (MLIR), which ranks a multilingual document collection, is harder to train than CLIR because the model must assign comparable relevance scores to documents in different languages. This work extends Translate-Distill and propose Multilingual Translate-Distill (MTD) for MLIR. We show that ColBERT-X models trained with MTD outperform their counterparts trained ith Multilingual Translate-Train, which is the previous state-of-the-art training approach, by 5% to 25% in nDCG@20 and 15% to 45% in MAP. We also show that the model is robust to the way languages are mixed in training batches. Our implementation is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Language Fairness in Multilingual Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) considers the problem of ranking documents in several languages for a query expressed in a language that may differ from any of those languages. Recent work has observed that approaches such as combining ranked lists representing a single document language each or using multilingual pretrained language models demonstrate a preference for one language over others. This results in systematic unfair treatment of documents in different languages. This work proposes a language fairness metric to evaluate whether documents across different languages are fairly ranked through statistical equivalence testing using the Kruskal-Wallis test. In contrast to most prior work in group fairness, we do not consider any language to be an unprotected group. Thus our proposed measure, PEER (Probability of EqualExpected Rank), is the first fairness metric specifically designed to capture the language fairness of MLIR systems. We demonstrate the behavior of PEER on artificial ranked lists. We also evaluate real MLIR systems on two publicly available benchmarks and show that the PEER scores align with prior analytical findings on MLIR fairness. Our implementation is compatible with ir-measures and is available at http://github.com/hltcoe/peer_measure.</description>

      <title>Multi-intent-aware Session-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the following item a user will interact with during an ongoing session. Most existing SBR models focus on designing sophisticated neural-based encoders to learn a session representation, capturing the relationship among session items. However, they tend to focus on the last item, neglecting diverse user intents that may exist within a session. This limitation leads to significant performance drops, especially for longer sessions. To address this issue, we propose a novel SBR model, called Multi-intent-aware Session-based Recommendation Model (MiaSRec). It adopts frequency embedding vectors indicating the item frequency in session to enhance the information about repeated items. MiaSRec represents various user intents by deriving multiple session representations centered on each item and dynamically selecting the important ones. Extensive experimental results show that MiaSRec outperforms existing state-of-the-art SBR models on six datasets, particularly those with longer average session length, achieving up to 6.27% and 24.56% gains for MRR@20 and Recall@20. Our code is available at https://github.com/jin530/MiaSRec.</description>

      <title>Fair Recommendations with Limited Sensitive Attributes: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As recommender systems are indispensable in various domains such as job searching and e-commerce, providing equitable recommendations to users with different sensitive attributes becomes an imperative requirement. Prior approaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume the availability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. In practice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us to investigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attribute information.
  Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitive attributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to the complexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legal regulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust to reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust Fair Optimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over all potential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead of the reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limited sensitive attributes are accessible.</description>

      <title>"In-Context Learning" or: How I learned to stop worrying and love "Applied Information Retrieval"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing ability of large language models (LLMs), in-context learning (ICL) has evolved as a new paradigm for natural language processing (NLP), where instead of fine-tuning the parameters of an LLM specific to a downstream task with labeled examples, a small number of such examples is appended to a prompt instruction for controlling the decoder's generation process. ICL, thus, is conceptually similar to a non-parametric approach, such as $k$-NN, where the prediction for each instance essentially depends on the local topology, i.e., on a localised set of similar instances and their labels (called few-shot examples). This suggests that a test instance in ICL is analogous to a query in IR, and similar examples in ICL retrieved from a training set relate to a set of documents retrieved from a collection in IR. While standard unsupervised ranking models can be used to retrieve these few-shot examples from a training set, the effectiveness of the examples can potentially be improved by re-defining the notion of relevance specific to its utility for the downstream task, i.e., considering an example to be relevant if including it in the prompt instruction leads to a correct prediction. With this task-specific notion of relevance, it is possible to train a supervised ranking model (e.g., a bi-encoder or cross-encoder), which potentially learns to optimally select the few-shot examples. We believe that the recent advances in neural rankers can potentially find a use case for this task of optimally choosing examples for more effective downstream ICL predictions.</description>

      <title>Faster Learned Sparse Retrieval with Block-Max Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned sparse retrieval systems aim to combine the effectiveness of contextualized language models with the scalability of conventional data structures such as inverted indexes. Nevertheless, the indexes generated by these systems exhibit significant deviations from the ones that use traditional retrieval models, leading to a discrepancy in the performance of existing query optimizations that were specifically developed for traditional structures. These disparities arise from structural variations in query and document statistics, including sub-word tokenization, leading to longer queries, smaller vocabularies, and different score distributions within posting lists. This paper introduces Block-Max Pruning (BMP), an innovative dynamic pruning strategy tailored for indexes arising in learned sparse retrieval environments. BMP employs a block filtering mechanism to divide the document space into small, consecutive document ranges, which are then aggregated and sorted on the fly, and fully processed only as necessary, guided by a defined safe early termination criterion or based on approximate retrieval requirements. Through rigorous experimentation, we show that BMP substantially outperforms existing dynamic pruning strategies, offering unparalleled efficiency in safe retrieval contexts and improved tradeoffs between precision and efficiency in approximate retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Generative Relevance Feedback and Convergence of Adaptive Re-Ranking: University of Glasgow Terrier Team at TREC DL 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes our participation in the TREC 2023 Deep Learning Track. We submitted runs that apply generative relevance feedback from a large language model in both a zero-shot and pseudo-relevance feedback setting over two sparse retrieval approaches, namely BM25 and SPLADE. We couple this first stage with adaptive re-ranking over a BM25 corpus graph scored using a monoELECTRA cross-encoder. We investigate the efficacy of these generative approaches for different query types in first-stage retrieval. In re-ranking, we investigate operating points of adaptive re-ranking with different first stages to find the point in graph traversal where the first stage no longer has an effect on the performance of the overall retrieval pipeline. We find some performance gains from the application of generative query reformulation. However, our strongest run in terms of P@10 and nDCG@10 applied both adaptive re-ranking and generative pseudo-relevance feedback, namely uogtr_b_grf_e_gb.</description>

      <title>Are We Really Achieving Better Beyond-Accuracy Performance in Next Basket Recommendation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next basket recommendation (NBR) is a special type of sequential recommendation that is increasingly receiving attention. So far, most NBR studies have focused on optimizing the accuracy of the recommendation, whereas optimizing for beyond-accuracy metrics, e.g., item fairness and diversity remains largely unexplored. Recent studies into NBR have found a substantial performance difference between recommending repeat items and explore items. Repeat items contribute most of the users' perceived accuracy compared with explore items. Informed by these findings, we identify a potential "short-cut" to optimize for beyond-accuracy metrics while maintaining high accuracy. To leverage and verify the existence of such short-cuts, we propose a plug-and-play two-step repetition-exploration (TREx) framework that treats repeat items and explores items separately, where we design a simple yet highly effective repetition module to ensure high accuracy, while two exploration modules target optimizing only beyond-accuracy metrics. Experiments are performed on two widely-used datasets w.r.t. a range of beyond-accuracy metrics, viz. five fairness metrics and three diversity metrics. Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of TREx. Prima facie, this appears to be good news: we can achieve high accuracy and improved beyond-accuracy metrics at the same time. However, we argue that the real-world value of our algorithmic solution, TREx, is likely to be limited and reflect on the reasonableness of the evaluation setup. We end up challenging existing evaluation paradigms, particularly in the context of beyond-accuracy metrics, and provide insights for researchers to navigate potential pitfalls and determine reasonable metrics to consider when optimizing for accuracy and beyond-accuracy metrics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Activity-Driven Music Listening with PACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the topic of listening context is widely studied in the literature of music recommender systems, the integration of regular user behavior is often omitted. In this paper, we propose PACE (PAttern-based user Consumption Embedding), a framework for building user embeddings that takes advantage of periodic listening behaviors. PACE leverages users' multichannel time-series consumption patterns to build understandable user vectors. We believe the embeddings learned with PACE unveil much about the repetitive nature of user listening dynamics. By applying this framework on long-term user histories, we evaluate the embeddings through a predictive task of activities performed while listening to music. The validation task's interest is two-fold, while it shows the relevance of our approach, it also offers an insightful way of understanding users' musical consumption habits.</description>

      <title>On the Evaluation of Machine-Generated Reports</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new ways to satisfy information needs. Although great strides have been made in applying them to settings like document ranking and short-form text generation, they still struggle to compose complete, accurate, and verifiable long-form reports. Reports with these qualities are necessary to satisfy the complex, nuanced, or multi-faceted information needs of users. In this perspective paper, we draw together opinions from industry and academia, and from a variety of related research areas, to present our vision for automatic report generation, and -- critically -- a flexible framework by which such reports can be evaluated. In contrast with other summarization tasks, automatic report generation starts with a detailed description of an information need, stating the necessary background, requirements, and scope of the report. Further, the generated reports should be complete, accurate, and verifiable. These qualities, which are desirable -- if not required -- in many analytic report-writing settings, require rethinking how to build and evaluate systems that exhibit these qualities. To foster new efforts in building these systems, we present an evaluation framework that draws on ideas found in various evaluations. To test completeness and accuracy, the framework uses nuggets of information, expressed as questions and answers, that need to be part of any high-quality generated report. Additionally, evaluation of citations that map claims made in the report to their source documents ensures verifiability.</description>

      <title>Silencing the Risk, Not the Whistle: A Semi-automated Text Sanitization Tool for Mitigating the Risk of Whistleblower Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whistleblowing is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in both public and private sectors. However, (potential) whistleblowers often fear or face retaliation, even when reporting anonymously. The specific content of their disclosures and their distinct writing style may re-identify them as the source. Legal measures, such as the EU WBD, are limited in their scope and effectiveness. Therefore, computational methods to prevent re-identification are important complementary tools for encouraging whistleblowers to come forward. However, current text sanitization tools follow a one-size-fits-all approach and take an overly limited view of anonymity. They aim to mitigate identification risk by replacing typical high-risk words (such as person names and other NE labels) and combinations thereof with placeholders. Such an approach, however, is inadequate for the whistleblowing scenario since it neglects further re-identification potential in textual features, including writing style. Therefore, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel classification and mitigation strategy for rewriting texts that involves the whistleblower in the assessment of the risk and utility. Our prototypical tool semi-automatically evaluates risk at the word/term level and applies risk-adapted anonymization techniques to produce a grammatically disjointed yet appropriately sanitized text. We then use a LLM that we fine-tuned for paraphrasing to render this text coherent and style-neutral. We evaluate our tool's effectiveness using court cases from the ECHR and excerpts from a real-world whistleblower testimony and measure the protection against authorship attribution (AA) attacks and utility loss statistically using the popular IMDb62 movie reviews dataset. Our method can significantly reduce AA accuracy from 98.81% to 31.22%, while preserving up to 73.1% of the original content's semantics.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces UQA, a novel dataset for question answering and text comprehension in Urdu, a low-resource language with over 70 million native speakers. UQA is generated by translating the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD2.0), a large-scale English QA dataset, using a technique called EATS (Enclose to Anchor, Translate, Seek), which preserves the answer spans in the translated context paragraphs. The paper describes the process of selecting and evaluating the best translation model among two candidates: Google Translator and Seamless M4T. The paper also benchmarks several state-of-the-art multilingual QA models on UQA, including mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mT5, and reports promising results. For XLM-RoBERTa-XL, we have an F1 score of 85.99 and 74.56 EM. UQA is a valuable resource for developing and testing multilingual NLP systems for Urdu and for enhancing the cross-lingual transferability of existing models. Further, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of EATS for creating high-quality datasets for other languages and domains. The UQA dataset and the code are publicly available at www.github.com/sameearif/UQA.</description>

      <title>Large language models can accurately predict searcher preferences</title>

Abstract: Relevance labels, which indicate whether a search result is valuable to a searcher, are key to evaluating and optimising search systems. The best way to capture the true preferences of users is to ask them for their careful feedback on which results would be useful, but this approach does not scale to produce a large number of labels. Getting relevance labels at scale is usually done with third-party labellers, who judge on behalf of the user, but there is a risk of low-quality data if the labeller doesn't understand user needs. To improve quality, one standard approach is to study real users through interviews, user studies and direct feedback, find areas where labels are systematically disagreeing with users, then educate labellers about user needs through judging guidelines, training and monitoring. This paper introduces an alternate approach for improving label quality. It takes careful feedback from real users, which by definition is the highest-quality first-party gold data that can be derived, and develops an large language model prompt that agrees with that data.
  We present ideas and observations from deploying language models for large-scale relevance labelling at Bing, and illustrate with data from TREC. We have found large language models can be effective, with accuracy as good as human labellers and similar capability to pick the hardest queries, best runs, and best groups. Systematic changes to the prompts make a difference in accuracy, but so too do simple paraphrases. To measure agreement with real searchers needs high-quality ``gold'' labels, but with these we find that models produce better labels than third-party workers, for a fraction of the cost, and these labels let us train notably better rankers.</description>

      <title>Language Models As Semantic Indexers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step introduces potential information loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing. It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the document's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we introduce LMIndexer, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective. We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval on five datasets from various domains.

      <title>Evaluating Generative Ad Hoc Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled the development of viable generative retrieval systems. Instead of a traditional document ranking, many generative retrieval systems directly return a grounded generated text as an answer to an information need expressed as a query or question. Quantifying the utility of the textual responses is essential for appropriately evaluating such generative ad hoc retrieval. Yet, the established evaluation methodology for ranking-based retrieval is not suited for reliable, repeatable, and reproducible evaluation of generated answers. In this paper, we survey the relevant literature from the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing, we identify search tasks and system architectures in generative retrieval, we develop a corresponding user model, and we study its operationalization. Our analysis provides a foundation and new insights for the evaluation of generative retrieval systems, focusing on ad hoc retrieval.</description>

      <title>What Are We Optimizing For? A Human-centric Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Movie Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, deep learning (DL) models have gained prominence for their exceptional accuracy on benchmark datasets in recommender systems (RecSys). However, their evaluation has primarily relied on offline metrics, overlooking direct user perception and experience. To address this gap, we conduct a human-centric evaluation case study of four leading DL-RecSys models in the movie domain. We test how different DL-RecSys models perform in personalized recommendation generation by conducting survey study with 445 real active users. We find some DL-RecSys models to be superior in recommending novel and unexpected items and weaker in diversity, trustworthiness, transparency, accuracy, and overall user satisfaction compared to classic collaborative filtering (CF) methods. To further explain the reasons behind the underperformance, we apply a comprehensive path analysis. We discover that the lack of diversity and too much serendipity from DL models can negatively impact the consequent perceived transparency and personalization of recommendations. Such a path ultimately leads to lower summative user satisfaction. Qualitatively, we confirm with real user quotes that accuracy plus at least one other attribute is necessary to ensure a good user experience, while their demands for transparency and trust can not be neglected. Based on our findings, we discuss future human-centric DL-RecSys design and optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Faster maximal clique enumeration in large real-world link streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link streams offer a good model for representing interactions over time. They consist of links $(b,e,u,v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices interacting during the whole time interval $[b,e]$. In this paper, we deal with the problem of enumerating maximal cliques in link streams. A clique is a pair $(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise during the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of vertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving this problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating maximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a new algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by links existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream. We prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the state-of-the art ones in many cases of interest. We also study the output-sensitive complexity, which is close to the output size, thereby showing that our algorithm is efficient. To confirm this, we perform experiments on link streams used in the state of the art, and on massive link streams, up to 100 million links. In all cases our algorithm is faster, mostly by a factor of at least 10 and up to a factor of $10^4$. Moreover, it scales to massive link streams for which the existing algorithms are not able to provide the solution.</description>

      <title>Disaggregated Multi-Tower: Topology-aware Modeling Technique for Efficient Large-Scale Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mismatch between the deep learning recommendation models' flat architecture, common distributed training paradigm and hierarchical data center topology. To address the associated inefficiencies, we propose Disaggregated Multi-Tower (DMT), a modeling technique that consists of (1) Semantic-preserving Tower Transform (SPTT), a novel training paradigm that decomposes the monolithic global embedding lookup process into disjoint towers to exploit data center locality; (2) Tower Module (TM), a synergistic dense component attached to each tower to reduce model complexity and communication volume through hierarchical feature interaction; and (3) Tower Partitioner (TP), a feature partitioner to systematically create towers with meaningful feature interactions and load balanced assignments to preserve model quality and training throughput via learned embeddings. We show that DMT can achieve up to 1.9x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art baselines without losing accuracy across multiple generations of hardware at large data center scales.</description>
