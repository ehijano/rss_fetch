      <title>Part-Time Penalties and Heterogeneous Retirement Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Older male workers exhibit diverse retirement behaviors across occupations and respond differently to policy changes, influenced significantly by the part-time penalty, wage reduction faced by part-time workers compared to their full-time counterparts. Many older individuals reduce their working hours, and in occupations with high part-time penalties, they tend to retire earlier, as observed in data from Japan and the United States. This study develops a general equilibrium model that incorporates occupational choices, endogenous labor supply, highlighting that the impact on the retirement decision is amplified by the presence of assets and pensions. I find that cutting employees' pension benefits reduce aggregate labor supply in occupations with high part-time penalties in Japan, reducing overall welfare across the economy. In contrast, increasing income tax credits and exempting pension form income tax boost labor supply across all occupations and enhance welfare by raising disposable wages relative to the reservation wage. Reducing part-time penalties in high-penalty occupations also stimulate the labor supply in high-penalty occupations and improve long-term welfare.</description>

      <title>Regional House Price Dynamics in Australia: Insights into Lifestyle and Mining Dynamics through PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to regional house price indexes to uncover dominant trends in Australia's housing market. Regions are assigned PCA-derived scores that reveal which underlying market forces are most influential in each area, enabling broad classification of local housing markets. The approach highlights where price movements tend to align across regions, even those geographically distant. The three most dominant trends are described in detail and, together with the regional scores, provide objective tools for policymakers, researchers, and real estate professionals.</description>

      <title>Critical misalignments in climate pledges reveal imbalanced sustainable development pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the integration of climate action and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in nationally determined contributions (NDCs), revealing persistent synergies and trade-offs across income groups. While high-income countries emphasize systemic challenges like health (SDG3) and inequality (SDG10), low-income nations prioritize the water-energy-food nexus (SDGs 6-7-12) and natural resource management (SDG15) due to vulnerabilities to climate impacts. Harnessing an innovative artificial intelligence routine, we discuss what these diverging development trajectories imply for the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development in terms of global inequality, the climate and sustainable finance flows and multilateral governance.</description>

      <title>Corporate Finance in the Age of Fintech: Scenarios and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain is a technological innovation that has the potential to radically change our financial markets by providing an alternative management approach to the "promise market", which is the foundation of our financial systems. Its disruptive potential also extends to corporate finance, where blockchain is beginning to influence valuation methods and capital allocation strategies, offering new perspectives on how companies are assessed and financed. However, for a new financial architecture based on blockchain and advancements in technology -- what is commonly referred to as Fintech -- to replace, in whole or in part, traditional finance, it will need to overcome significant challenges such as regulation, environmental sustainability, its association with illegal activities, and achieving greater efficiency in cryptocurrency markets. For this reason, the future of Fintech is likely to be more conventional -- yet also more transparent, efficient, and regulated -- ultimately evolving to resemble the traditional finance we know.</description>

      <title>On the Characteristics of the Free Market in a Cooperative Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:1506.03917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The key characteristic of a true free market economy is that exchanges are entirely voluntary. When there is a monopoly in the creation of currency as we have in today's markets, you no longer have a true free market. Features of the current economic system such as central banking and taxation would be nonexistent in a free market. This paper examines how currency monopoly leads to the instabilities and imbalances that we see in today's economy. It also proposes that currencies should emerge from the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and studies economic interaction across all scales, by considering economic action in cases where the self-interests of individuals are coincident. By examining the voluntary exchange of goods and services at the scale of an entire society, it is shown that a new currency system, which resolves a lot of the problems caused by the current fiat currency system, emerges naturally from the free market. The new currency system is robust and efficient, and provides a way for public goods and services to be provided, and its providers compensated, without the need for direct taxation.</description>

      <title>Fiscal Policy and Household Savings in Central Europe (Poland, Croatia, and Slovak Republic) -- A Markov Switching VAR with Covid Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of fiscal policies on household consumption, disposable income, and the propensity to consume during the COVID-19 pandemic across Croatia, Slovakia, and Poland. The purpose is to assess how variations in government debt, expenditures, revenue, and subsidies influenced household financial behaviors in response to economic shocks. Using a Markov Switching VAR model across three regimes: initial impact, peak crisis, and recovery.This analysis captures changes in household consumption, disposable income, and consumption propensities under different fiscal policy measures.
  The findings reveal that the Slovak Republic exhibited the highest fiscal effectiveness, demonstrating effective government policies that stimulated consumer spending and supported household income during the pandemic. Croatia also showed positive outcomes, particularly in terms of income, although rising government debt posed challenges to overall effectiveness. Conversely, Poland faced significant obstacles, with its fiscal measures leading to lower consumption and income outcomes, indicating limited policy efficacy.
  Conclusions emphasize the importance of tailored fiscal measures, as their effectiveness varied across countries and economic contexts. Recommendations include reinforcing consumption-supportive policies, particularly during crisis periods, to stabilize income and consumption expectations. This study underscores the significance of targeted fiscal actions in promoting household resilience and economic stability, as exemplified by the successful approach taken by the Slovak Republic.</description>

      <title>Public Sector Efficiency in Delivering Social Services and Its Impact on Human Development: A Comparative Study of Healthcare and Education Spending in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The research investigates the effects of public spending on health and education in shaping the human development in south Asian three countries: India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The study uses the VAR (Vector Auto regression) model to estimate the effects on government spending on these sectors to evaluate the human development. The findings state that there are different degrees of impact in these three countries. In Bangladesh and India, health spending increases the human development in short term. On the other hand education spending shows the significance on the HDI.Moreover, the study also highlights that there are different levels of effectiveness of government spending across these three countries. In order to maximize the human development an optimum country specific strategies should be adopted.</description>

      <title>The Impact Of Industrial Production On Economic Growth: New Empirical Evidence For Turkiye In A Material Development Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are different views in the literature regarding economic growth and development. Growth and development hypotheses have been addressed from many different perspectives. It is aimed to examine the view of production with the Heavy Industry Initiative proposed by Prof. Dr. Necmettin Erbakan a crucial part of Material Development in T\"urkiye. In this context, an examination has been conducted on GDP, Mining, Manufacturing, Energy, and Chemical Industry Productions in T\"urkiye between 1995-2023, focusing on percentage changes. The stationarity of our data set has been checked, and a VAR estimation has been performed by determining the lag length. Long-term relationships have been identified through the Johansen Cointegration test, and after confirming that there are no issues of autocorrelation and changing variance, variance decomposition has been carried out. Thus, inferences have been made regarding the effects of the identified sectors on GDP. Based on the analysis results, it has been observed that there is a stronger relationship between GDP and the Manufacturing Sector compared to the Mining, Energy, and Chemical Sectors, and it has been concluded that sectoral shocks diminish over time. Additionally, VAR Impulse-Response Analysis has been conducted among the variables. In this context, it has been observed that the variables in the dataset have an impact on each other in both the short and long term. It has been concluded that the shocks were more pronounced in the initial periods, while the economy reached a balance over time. In this regard, it has been confirmed that the heavy industry initiative exhibited different responses sectorally, while also being significant in terms of economic growth and development.</description>

      <title>Darwinian spreading and quality thinning in even-aged boreal forest stands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Darwinian spreading of vigor, in addition to quality distribution, is introduced in a tree growth model. The size of any tree, within an even-aged stand, is taken as a measure of an inherited productive capacity, and then combined with quality thinning. For sparse cultivation density, the result is forestry without commercial thinnings; large trees cannot be removed since they are the most productive, neither small trees because the unit price of harvesting would be large. For large cultivation density, thinning from above becomes combined with quality thinning of large trees. Darwinian spreading of growth rate may correlate with quality. Quality thinning may enhance growth rate. Such effects combined, large trees still become removed but quality thinning becomes implemented in almost all diameter classes. At financial maturity, Darwinian spreading treated with quality thinning, the weighted mean breast height diameter is in the vicinity of 20 cm within stands of high planting density, and somewhat higher with low planting density. Quality correlating with Darwinian spreading of growth, and growth rate correlating with observed quality, trees grow bigger, the maturity size becoming closer to 25 cm - bigger than in earlier studies without tree-size - dependency of vigor.</description>
