      <title>The Solirad (So) as a Convenient Unit for Quoting Astronomical Irradiances for Planetary Insolations and Exoplanetary Instellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of physical parameters for stars and (exo)planets are often quoted in units normalized to the Sun and/or Earth. The nominal total solar irradiance, ${S}^{\rm N}_{\odot}$, while based on a current best estimate with uncertainties, was adopted to be an exact reference value of 1361 W m$^{-2}$ by IAU 2015 Resolution B3, corresponding to ``the mean total electromagnetic energy from the Sun, integrated over all wavelengths, incident per unit area per unit time at distance 1 au''. In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for ``flux'', ``insolation'', ``instellation'', etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent. To simplify the quoting of irradiance units for astronomical applications, we introduce the portmanteau solirad, short for solar irradiance, as an abbreviated version of the longer IAU term ``nominal total solar irradiance''. The solirad (So) is a unit of irradiance, where 1 solirad = 1 So = 1361 W m$^{-2}$, equivalent to the IAU nominal total solar irradiance, and to an apparent bolometric magnitude of $m_{bol}$ = -26.832 mag (per IAU 2015 Resolution B2).</description>

      <title>The Hot Jupiter Radius Anomaly and Stellar Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extremely close proximity of hot Jupiters to their parent stars has dramatically affected both their atmospheres and interiors, inflating them to up to twice the radius of Jupiter. The physical mechanism responsible for this inflation remains unknown, though many proposals have been put forward. I will review the known hot Jupiter population, the proposed inflation mechanisms, and the evidence for and against them collected thus far. In doing so, I will cover the ways that hot Jupiter interiors may be simulated computationally in detail, and present some useful formulas for estimating their radii, heating, intrinsic temperature, and tentative magnetic field strength. I will also cover the related issues of hot Jupiter intrinsic temperatures and radiative-convective boundaries, the potential connection with planetary magnetic fields, and the effects of stellar tides on the planet. Finally, I conclude with the suggestion that more than one mechanism may be operating in concert with each other and propose various avenues for future progress in understanding these objects.</description>

      <title>How clear are the skies of WASP-80b?: 3D Cloud feedback on the atmosphere and spectra of the warm Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Close-in warm Jupiters orbiting M-dwarf stars are expected to exhibit diverse atmospheric chemistry, with clouds playing a key role in shaping their albedo, heat distribution, and spectral properties. We study WASP-80b, a warm Jupiter orbiting an M-dwarf star, using the latest JWST panchromatic emission and transmission spectra to comprehensively characterise its atmosphere, including cloud coverage, chemical composition, and particle sizes, and compare the observations with predictions from the General Circulation Models (GCM). We use a GCM, ADAM (ADvanced Atmospheric MITgcm, formerly known as SPARC/MITgcm), combined with the latest JWST data to study the atmosphere of WASP-80b. A cloud module with radiatively active, tracer-based clouds is integrated with the GCM to study the effects on the atmosphere and the spectrum. Our results indicate that both emission and transmission spectra of WASP-80b are best reproduced by cloudless GCMs or by atmospheres containing large cloud particles ($\geq 10~\mu$m for Na$_2$S, $\geq 1~\mu$m for KCl, and $\geq 5~\mu$m for MgSiO$_3$), with smaller particles ruled out due to their strong radiative feedback. These findings emphasize the importance of particle size and composition in interpreting exoplanet atmospheric spectra and showcase the power of global modelling in constraining cloud properties. Among the expected clouds to form in WASP-80b, we show that only Na$_2$S clouds forming particles larger than 10 $\mu m$, KCl clouds larger than 1 $\mu m$, or MgSiO$_3$ clouds with particles larger than $5 \mu m$ can be compatible with the apparently cloudless emission and transmission spectra. Observations at shorter wavelengths in both emission and transmission could further distinguish between these cloudy scenarios and a truly cloudless atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Emergence of streamers in simulations of late infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks may undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late infall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of so-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended gas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching consequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing treatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the emergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their morphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental conditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical simulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain synthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with a "cloudlet" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the fallback of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a timescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form naturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such encounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous detection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for a disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of $v_\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity dispersion of $\sigma_\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find considerable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which may act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas surrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which planets form.</description>

      <title>Towards an Agnostic Algorithm for Sampling Empirical Structure Models: The case of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoids the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and instead uses an optimisation-based gradient-descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg$\,$m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</description>

      <title>3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.</description>
