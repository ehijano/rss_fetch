      <title>Comparing Disciplinary Classifications in SSH: Organizational, Channel-Based, and Text-Based Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how different approaches to disciplinary classification represent the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) in the Flemish VABB-SHW database. We compare organizational classification (based on author affiliation), channel-based cognitive classification (based on publication venues), and text-based publication-level classification (using channel titles, publication titles, and abstracts, depending on availability). The analysis shows that text-based classification generally aligns more closely with channel-based categories, confirming that the channel choice provides relevant information about publication content. At the same time, it is closer to organizational classification than channel-based categories are, suggesting that textual features capture author affiliations more directly than publishing channels do. Comparison across the three systems highlights cases of convergence and divergence, offering insights into how disciplines such as "Sociology" and "History" extend across fields, while "Law" remains more contained. Publication-level classification also clarifies the disciplinary profiles of multidisciplinary journals in the database, which in VABB-SHW show distinctive profiles with stronger emphases on SSH and health sciences. At the journal level, fewer than half of outlets with more than 50 publications have their channel-level classification fully or partially supported by more than 90% of publications. These results demonstrate the added value of text-based methods for validating classifications and for analysing disciplinary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparing Retrieval Strategies to Capture Interdisciplinary Scientific Research: A Bibliometric Evaluation of the Integration of Neuroscience and Computer Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary scientific research is increasingly important in knowledge production, funding policies, and academic discussions on scholarly communication. While many studies focus on interdisciplinary corpora defined a priori -- usually through keyword-based searches within assumed interdisciplinary domains -- few explore interdisciplinarity as an emergent intersection between two distinct fields. Thus, methodological proposals for building databases at the intersection of two fields of knowledge are scarce. The goal of this article is to develop and compare different strategies for defining an interdisciplinary corpus between two bodies of knowledge. As a case study, we focus on the intersection between neuroscience and computer science. To this end, we develop and compare four retrieval strategies, two of them based on keywords and two based on citation and reference patterns. Our results show that the reference-based strategy provides better retrieval, pseudorecall, and F1. While we focus on comparing strategies for the study of the intersection between the fields of neuroscience and computer science, this methodological reflection is applicable to a wide range of interdisciplinary domains.</description>

      <title>Detecting Latin in Historical Books with Large Language Models: A Multimodal Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel task of extracting Latin fragments from mixed-language historical documents with varied layouts. We benchmark and evaluate the performance of large foundation models against a multimodal dataset of 724 annotated pages. The results demonstrate that reliable Latin detection with contemporary models is achievable. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of these models' capabilities and limits for this task.</description>
