      <title>Dynamics of the combined nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with inverse-square potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09435v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the long-time dynamics of focusing energy-critical Schr\"odinger equation perturbed by the $\dot{H}^\frac{1}{2}$-critical nonlinearity and with inverse-square potential(CNLS$_a$) in dimensions $d\in\{3,4,5\}$ \begin{equation}\label{NLS-ab} \begin{cases} i\partial_tu-\mathcal{L}_au=-|u|^{\frac{4}{d-2}}u+|u|^{\frac{4}{d-1}}u, \quad (t,x)\in\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^d,\tag{CNLS$_a$},\\ u(0,x)=u_0(x)\in H^1_a(\mathbb{R}^d), \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\mathcal{L}_a=-\Delta+a|x|^{-2}$ and the energy is below and equal to the threshold $m_a$, which is given by the ground state $W_a$ satisfying $\mathcal{L}_aW_a=|W_a|^{\frac{4}{d-2}}W_a$. When the energy is below the threshold, we utilize the concentration-compactness argument as well as the variatonal analysis to characterize the scattering and blow-up region. When the energy is equal to the threshold, we use the modulation analysis associated to the equation \eqref{NLS-ab} to classify the dynamics of $H_a^1$-solution. In both regimes of scattering results, we do not need the radial assumption in $d=4,5$. Our result generalizes the scattering results of [31-33] and [3] in the setting of standard combined NLS.</description>

      <title>Bounded functional calculus for divergence form operators with dynamical boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider divergence form operators with complex coefficients on an open subset of Euclidean space. Boundary conditions in the corresponding parabolic problem are dynamical, that is, the time derivative appears on the boundary. As a matter of fact, the elliptic operator and its semigroup act simultaneously in the interior and on the boundary. We show that the elliptic operator has a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty$-calculus in $\mathrm{L}^p$ if the coefficients satisfy a $p$-adapted ellipticity condition. A major challenge in the proof is that different parts of the spatial domain of the operator have different dimensions. Our strategy relies on extending a contractivity criterion due to Nittka and a non-linear heat flow method recently popularized by Carbonaro-Dragi\v{c}evi\'c to our setting.</description>

      <title>On the long time behaviour of solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system on unbounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system on an unbounded domain in the Euclidean space $R^3$, supplemented by the far field conditions for the phase variables, specifically: $\rho \to 0,\ \vartheta \to \vartheta_\infty, \ u \to 0$ as $\ |x| \to \infty$. We study the long time behaviour of solutions and we prove that any global-in-time weak solution to the NSF system approaches the equilibrium $\rho_s = 0,\ \vartheta_s = \vartheta_\infty,\ u_s = 0$ in the sense of ergodic averages for time tending to infinity. As a consequence of the convergence result combined with the total mass conservation, we can show that the total momentum of global-in-time weak solutions is never globally conserved.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of backward bounded solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the collection $\mathcal M_{-\infty}$ of backward bounded solutions for a semilinear evolution equation is the graph of an upper hemicontinuous set-valued function from the low Fourier modes to the higher Fourier modes, which is invariant and contains the global attractor. We also show that there exists a limit $\mathcal M_{\infty}$ of finite dimensional Lipschitz manifolds $\mathcal M_t$ generated by the time $t$-maps ($t&gt;0$) from the flat manifold $\mathcal M_0$ with the Hausdorff distance and we find $\mathcal M_{\infty} \subset \mathcal M_{-\infty}$. No spectral gap conditions are assumed.</description>

      <title>Steady Contiguous Vortex-Patch Dipole Solutions of the 2D Incompressible Euler Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first steady traveling wave solutions of the 2D incompressible Euler equation that take the form of a contiguous vortex-patch dipole, which can be viewed as the vortex-patch counterpart of the well-known Lamb-Chaplygin dipole. Our construction is based on a novel fixed-point approach that determines the patch boundary as the fixed point of a certain nonlinear map. Smoothness and other properties of the patch boundary are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Liouville-type theorems for Axisymmetric solutions to steady Navier-Stokes system in a layer domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Liouville-type theorems for axisymmetric solutions to steady Navier-Stokes system in a layer domain. The both cases for the flows supplemented with no-slip boundary and Navier boundary conditions are studied. If the width of the outlet grows at a rate less than $R^{\frac{1}{2}}$, any bounded solution is proved to be trivial. Meanwhile, if the width of the outlet grows at a rate less than $R^{\frac{4}{5}}$, every D-solution is proved to be trivial. The key idea of the proof is to establish a Saint-Venant type estimate that characterizes the growth of Dirichlet integral of nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Dissipation through combinations of nonlocal and gradient nonlinearities in chemotaxis models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work concerns with a class of chemotaxis models in which external sources, comprising nonlocal and gradient-dependent damping reactions, influence the motion of a cell density attracted by a chemical signal. The mechanism of the two densities is studied in bounded and impenetrable regions. In particular, it is seen that no gathering effect for the cells can appear in time provided that the damping impacts are sufficiently strong.</description>

      <title>Output-feedback stabilization of a class of n+m linear hyperbolic ODE-PDE-ODE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design an output-feedback controller to stabilize n +m hetero-directional transport partial differential equations (PDEs) coupled on both domain boundaries to ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This class of systems can represent, for instance, actuator and load dynamics at the boundaries of a hyperbolic system. The actuator is located at the connection point between the PDE and one of the ODEs, and we consider anti-collocated PDE measurements. We first design a state-observer by combining the backstepping methodology with time-delay system approaches. We then introduce a state feedback controller using analogous techniques before designing the wanted output-feedback control law.</description>

      <title>On Bourgain's approach to stochastic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, Bourgain pioneered a novel perturbative harmonic-analytic approach to the stochastic homogenization theory of discrete elliptic equations with weakly random i.i.d. coefficients. The approach was subsequently refined to show that homogenized approximations of ensemble averages can be derived to a precision four times better than almost sure homogenized approximations, which was unexpected by the state-of-the-art homogenization theory. In this paper, we grow this budding theory in various directions: First, we prove that the approach is robust by extending it to the continuum setting with exponentially mixing random coefficients. Second, we give a new proof via Malliavin calculus in the case of Gaussian coefficients, which avoids the main technicality of Bourgain's original approach. This new proof also applies to strong Gaussian correlations with power-law decay. Third, we extend Bourgain's approach to the study of fluctuations by constructing weak correctors up to order $2d$, which also clarifies the link between Bourgain's approach and the standard corrector approach to homogenization. Finally, we draw several consequences from those different results, both for quantitative homogenization of ensemble averages and for asymptotic expansions of the annealed Green's function.</description>

      <title>On Aharonov-Bohm operators with multiple colliding poles of any circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with quantitative spectral stability for Aharonov-Bohm operators with many colliding poles of whichever circulation. An equivalent formulation of the eigenvalue problem is derived as a system of two equations with real coefficients, coupled through prescribed jumps of the unknowns and their normal derivatives across the segments joining the poles with the collision point. Under the assumption that the sum of all circulations is not integer, the dominant term in the asymptotic expansion for eigenvalues is characterized in terms of the minimum of an energy functional associated with the configuration of poles. Estimates of the order of vanishing of the eigenvalue variation are then deduced from a blow-up analysis, yielding sharp asymptotics in some particular examples.</description>

      <title>The heat flow on glued spaces with varying dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine under which conditions the canonical heat flow on glued manifolds is ergodic and irreducible. Glued manifolds are spaces consisting of manifolds of varying dimension connected by a weakly doubling measure. Moreover, we construct a non-local perimeter functional, the heat excess, to raise the question of its ${\Gamma}$-convergence to the standard perimeter functional. In this context, we connect our work to the previous work on the convergence of perimeter functionals, approximations, and existence of heat kernels, as well as short-time expansions of Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically explain how to apply the analytical technique called the invariant subspace method to find various types of analytical solutions for a coupled nonlinear time-fractional system of partial differential equations with time delays. Also, the present work explicitly studies a systematic way to obtain various kinds of finite-dimensional invariant vector spaces for the coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-reaction (DR) system with time delays under the two distinct fractional derivatives, namely (a) the Riemann-Liouville fractional partial time derivative and (b) the Caputo fractional partial time derivative. Additionally, we provide details of deriving analytical solutions in the generalized separable form for the initial and boundary value problems (IBVPs) of the coupled nonlinear time-fractional DR system with multiple time delays through the obtained invariant vector spaces under the considered two time-fractional derivatives.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium for cross diffusion systems with nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and the rate of equilibration of weak solutions to a two-component system of non-linear diffusion-aggregation equations, with small cross diffusion effects. The aggregation term is assumed to be purely attractive, and in the absence of cross diffusion, the flow is exponentially contractive towards a compactly supported steady state. Our main result is that for small cross diffusion, the system still converges, at a slightly lower rate, to a deformed but still compactly supported steady state.
  Our approach relies on the interpretation of the PDE system as a gradient flow in a two-component Wasserstein metric. The energy consists of a uniformly convex part responsible for self-diffusion and non-local aggregation, and a totally non-convex part that generates cross diffusion; the latter is scaled by a coupling parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. The core idea of the proof is to perform an $\varepsilon$-dependent modification of the convex/non-convex splitting and establish a control on the non-convex terms by the convex ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Legendrian integral currents in a contact manifold that locally minimize the mass among Legendrian competitors have a regular set which is open and dense in their support. We apply this to show existence and partial regularity of solutions of the Legendrian Plateau problem in the $n$th Heisenberg group for an arbitrary horizontal $(n-1)$-cycle as prescribed boundary, and of mass-minimizing Legendrian integral currents in any $n$-dimensional homology class of a closed contact $(2n+1)$-manifold. In the case of the Heisenberg group, our result applies to Ambrosio--Kirchheim metric currents with respect to the Carnot--Carath\'eodory distance. Our results do not assume any compatibility between the subriemannian metric and the symplectic form.</description>

      <title>Smooth solutions to the Christoffel problem in $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Christoffel problem is possibly the oldest problem of prescribed curvatures for convex hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. Recently, this problem has been naturally formulated in the context of uniformly $h$-convex hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space by Espinar-G\'alvez-Mira.
  Surprisingly, Espinar-G\'alvez-Mira find that the Christoffel problem in hyperbolic space is essentially equivalent to the Nirenberg-Kazdan-Warner problem on prescribing scalar curvature on $\mathbb{S}^n$. This equivalence opens a new door to study the Nirenberg-Kazdan-Warner problem.
  In this paper, we establish a existence of solutions to the Christoffel problem in hyperbolic space by proving a full rank theorem. As a corollary, a existence of solutions to the Nirenberg-Kazdan-Warner problem follows.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear two-component system of time-fractional PDEs in (2+1)-dimensions: Invariant subspace method combined with variable transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a systematic approach of the invariant subspace method combined with variable transformation to find the generalized separable exact solutions of the nonlinear two-component system of time-fractional PDEs (TFPDEs) in (2+1)-dimensions for the first time. Also, we explicitly explain how to construct various kinds of finite-dimensional invariant linear product spaces for the given system using the invariant subspace method combined with variable transformation. Additionally, we present how to use the obtained invariant linear product spaces to derive the generalized separable exact solutions of the discussed system. We also note that the discussed method will help to reduce the nonlinear two-component system of TFPDEs in (2+1)-dimensions into the nonlinear two-component system of TFPDEs in (1+1)-dimensions, which again reduces to a system of time-fractional ODEs through the obtained invariant linear product spaces. More specifically, the significance and efficacy of the systematic investigation of the discussed method have been investigated through the initial and boundary value problems of the generalized nonlinear two-component system of time-fractional reaction-diffusion equations (TFRDEs) in (2+1)-dimensions for finding the generalized separable exact solutions, which can be expressed in terms of the exponential, trigonometric, polynomial, Euler-Gamma and Mittag-Leffler functions. Also, 2D and 3D graphical representations of some of the obtained solutions are presented for different values of fractional orders.</description>

      <title>Double b-fibrations and desingularization of the X-ray transform on manifolds with strictly convex boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14904v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mapping properties of the X-ray transform and its adjoint on spaces of conormal functions on Riemannian manifolds with strictly convex boundary. After desingularizing the double fibration, and expressing the X-ray transform and its adjoint using b-fibrations operations, we employ tools related to Melrose's Pushforward Theorem to describe the mapping properties of these operators on various classes of polyhomogeneous functions, with special focus to computing how leading order coefficients are transformed. The appendix explains that a na\"ive use of the Pushforward Theorem leads to a suboptimal result with non-sharp index sets. Our improved results are obtained by closely inspecting Mellin functions which arise in the process, showing that certain coefficients vanish. This recovers some sharp results known by other methods. A number of consequences for the mapping properties of the X-ray transform and its normal operator(s) follow.</description>

      <title>Global Solutions for Two-Phase Complex Fluids with Quadratic Anchoring in Soft Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a diffuse interface model describing the complex rheology and the interfacial dynamics during phase separation in a polar liquid-crystalline emulsion. More precisely, the physical systems comprises a two-phase mixture consisting in a polar liquid crystal immersed in a Newtonian fluid. Such composite material is a paradigmatic example of complex fluids arising in Soft Matter which exhibits multiscale interplay. Beyond the Ginzburg-Landau and Frank elastic energies for the concentration and the polarization, the free energy of the system is characterized by a quadratic anchoring term which tunes the orientation of the polarization at the interface. This leads to several quasi-linear nonlinear couplings in the resulting system describing the macroscopic dynamics. In this work, we establish the first mathematical results concerning the global dynamics of two-phase complex fluids with interfacial anchoring mechanism. First, we determine a set of sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system and the initial conditions which guarantee the existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions. Secondly, we show that weak solutions are unique and globally regular in the two dimensional case. Finally, we complement our analysis with some numerical simulations to display polarization and interfacial anchoring.</description>

      <title>Gaussian estimates vs. elliptic regularity on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an elliptic operator $L= - \mathrm{div} (A \nabla \cdot)$ subject to mixed boundary conditions on an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, we study the relation between Gaussian pointwise estimates for the kernel of the associated heat semigroup, H\"older continuity of $L$-harmonic functions and the growth of the Dirichlet energy. To this end, we generalize an equivalence theorem of Auscher and Tchamitchian to the case of mixed boundary conditions and to open sets far beyond Lipschitz domains. Yet we prove consistency of our abstract result by encompassing operators with real-valued coefficients and their small complex perturbations into one of the aforementioned equivalent properties. The resulting kernel bounds open the door for developing a harmonic analysis for the associated semigroups on rough open sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\em vortex pair} solution of the incompressible $2d$ Euler equation in vorticity form $$ \omega_t + \nabla^\perp \Psi\cdot \nabla \omega = 0 , \quad \Psi = (-\Delta)^{-1} \omega, \quad \hbox{in } \mathbb{R}^2 \times (0,\infty)$$ is a travelling wave solution of the form $\omega(x,t) = W(x_1-ct,x_2 )$ where $W(x)$ is compactly supported and odd in $x_2$. We revisit the problem of constructing solutions which are highly $\varepsilon$-concentrated around points $ (0, \pm q)$, more precisely with approximately radially symmetric, compactly supported bumps with radius $\varepsilon$ and masses $\pm m$. Fine asymptotic expressions are obtained, and the smooth dependence on the parameters $q$ and $\varepsilon$ for the solution and its propagation speed $c$ are established. These results improve constructions through variational methods in [14] and in [5] for the case of a bounded domain.</description>

      <title>Positivity and global existence for nonlocal advection-diffusion models of interacting populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a broad class of non-local advection-diffusion models describing the behaviour of an arbitrary number of interacting species, each moving in response to the non-local presence of others. Our model allows for different non-local interaction kernels for each species and arbitrarily many spatial dimensions. We prove the global existence of both non-negative weak solutions in any spatial dimension and positive classical solutions in one spatial dimension. These results generalise and unify various existing results regarding existence of non-local advection-diffusion equations. We also prove that solutions can blow up in finite time when the detection radius becomes zero, i.e. when the system is local, thus showing that nonlocality is essential for the global existence of solutions. We verify our results with some numerical simulations on 2D spatial domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a vanishing result for solutions of the inequality $|\Delta u|\le q_1|u|+q_2|\nabla u|$ that decay to zero along a very general warped cylindrical end of a Riemannian manifold. The appropriate decay condition at infinity on $u$ is related to the behavior of the potential functions $q_1$ and $q_2$ and to the asymptotic geometry of the end. The main ingredient is a new Carleman estimate of independent interest. Geometric applications to conformal deformations and to minimal graphs are presented.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for doubly critical variable-order $p(x)$-Choquard-Kirchhoff type equations via the concentration compactness method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of infinitely many solutions of a doubly critical Choquard-Kirchhoff type equation \begin{equation*} \begin{split} &amp;M(\mathcal{E}[u])(-\Delta)_{p(\cdot)}^{s(\cdot)}u+V(x)|u|^{p(x)-2}u-\varepsilon_W W(x)|u|^{q_W(x)-2}u \\ &amp;\quad\quad=\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} \frac{|u(x)|^{r(x)} |u(y)|^{r(y)-2}u(y)}{|x-y|^{\alpha(x,y)}}dy+ |u|^{q_c(x)-2}u\quad\text{in $\mathbb{R}^N$} \end{split} \end{equation*} with variable smoothness $s(\cdot)$ and variable integrability exponents $p(\cdot)$, $q_W(\cdot)$, $q_c(\cdot)$. The exponents $r(\cdot)$ and $q_c(\cdot)$ may have critical growths at the same time in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and Sobolev inequality, respectively. In the course of consideration, we formulate a new Sobolev type embedding theorem for the Slobodeckij spaces with variable smoothness and extend the concentration compactness lemma to the variable exponent case in the form involving some nonlocal quantities. To obtain a sequence of solutions, we use a critical point theorem based on Krasnoselskii's genus.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time estimates on the size of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of classical Brownian particles interacting via a smooth long-range potential in the mean-field regime, and we analyze the propagation of chaos in form of sharp, uniform-in-time estimates on many-particle correlation functions. Our results cover both the kinetic Langevin setting and the corresponding overdamped Brownian dynamics. The approach is mainly based on so-called Lions expansions, which we combine with new diagrammatic tools to capture many-particle cancellations, as well as with fine ergodic estimates on the linearized mean-field equation, and with discrete stochastic calculus with respect to initial data. In the process, we derive some new ergodic estimates for the linearized Vlasov-Fokker-Planck kinetic equation that are of independent interest. Our analysis also leads to uniform-in-time concentration estimates and to a uniform-in-time quantitative central limit theorem for the empirical measure associated with the particle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Uniform Resolvent Estimates for Subwavelength Resonators: The Minnaert Bubble Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength resonators are small scaled objects that exhibit contrasting medium properties (eigher in intensity or sign) while compared to the ones of a uniform background. Such contrasts allow them to resonate at specific frequencies. There are two ways to mathematically define these resonances. First, as the frequencies for which the related system of integral equations is not injective. Second, as the frequencies for which the related resolvent operator of the natural Hamiltonian has a pole. In this work, we consider, as the subwavelength resonator, the Minneart bubble. We show that these two mentioned definitions are equivalent. Most importantly,
  1. we derive the related resolvent estimates which are uniform in terms of the size/contrast of the resonators. As a by product, we show that the resolvent operators have no resonances in the upper half complex plane while they exhibit two resonances in the lower half plane which converge to the real axis, as the size of the bubble tends to zero. These resonances are related to the Minnaert frequency (which constitutes their dominating real part).
  2. we derive the asymptotic estimates of the generated scattered fields which are uniform in terms of the incident frequency and which are valid everywhere in space (i.e. inside or outside the bubble).
  \end{enumerate} The dominating parts, for both the resolvent operator and the scattered fields, are given by the ones of the point-scatterer supported at the location of the bubble. In particular, these dominant parts are non trivial (not the same as those of the background medium) if and only if the used incident frequency identifies with the Minnaert one.</description>

      <title>On location of maximal gradient of torsion function over some non-symmetric planar domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the location of the maximal gradient of the torsion function on some non-symmetric planar domains. First, for triangles, by reflection method, we show that the maximal gradient of the torsion function always occurs on the longest sides, lying between the foot of the altitude and the middle point. Moreover, via nodal line analysis and continuity method, we demonstrate that restricted on each side, the critical point of gradient of the torsion function is unique and nondegenerate. Second, by establishing uniform estimates for narrow domains, we prove that as a planar domain bounded by two graphs of function becomes increasingly narrow, the location of maximal gradient of its torsion tends toward the endpoint of the longest vertical line segment, with smaller curvature among them. This shows that Saint-Venant's conjecture on location of fail points is valid for asymptotically narrow domains. Third, using the reflection method, we prove that for a non-concentric annulus, maximal gradient of torsion always occurs at the point on the inner ring closest to the center of the outer ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's notion of magnitude for a smooth manifold with boundary of arbitrary dimension, motivated by open questions for the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a large class of distance functions, including embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds satisfying a technical condition, we show that the magnitude function is well defined for $R\gg 0$ and admits a meromorphic continuation to sectors in $\mathbb{C}$. In the semiclassical limit $R \to \infty$, the magnitude function admits an asymptotic expansion, which determines the volume, surface area and integrals of generalized curvatures. Lower-order terms are computed by black box computer algebra. We initiate the study of magnitude analogues to classical questions in spectral geometry and prove an asymptotic variant of the Leinster-Willerton conjecture.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for PDE Backstepping Control of First-Order Hyperbolic PIDE with Recycle and Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced DeepONet operator-learning framework for PDE control is extended from the results for basic hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs to an advanced hyperbolic class that involves delays on both the state and the system output or input. The PDE backstepping design produces gain functions that are outputs of a nonlinear operator, mapping functions on a spatial domain into functions on a spatial domain, and where this gain-generating operator's inputs are the PDE's coefficients. The operator is approximated with a DeepONet neural network to a degree of accuracy that is provably arbitrarily tight. Once we produce this approximation-theoretic result in infinite dimension, with it we establish stability in closed loop under feedback that employs approximate gains. In addition to supplying such results under full-state feedback, we also develop DeepONet-approximated observers and output-feedback laws and prove their own stabilizing properties under neural operator approximations. With numerical simulations we illustrate the theoretical results and quantify the numerical effort savings, which are of two orders of magnitude, thanks to replacing the numerical PDE solving with the DeepONet.</description>

Abstract: We prove a convergence result for a large class of random models that encompasses the case of the BPHZ models used in the study of singular stochastic PDEs. We introduce for that purpose a useful variation on the notion of regularity structure called a regularity-integrability structure. It allows to deal in a single elementary setting with models on a usual regularity structure and their first order Malliavin derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behaviour of critical points of the Ginzburg-Landau perturbation of the Dirichlet energy into the sphere $E_\varepsilon(u):=\int_\Sigma \frac{1}{2}|du|^2_h\ \,dvol_h +\frac{1}{4\varepsilon^2}(1-|u|^2)^2\,dvol_h=\int_{\Sigma}e_{\varepsilon}(u)$. Our first main result is a precise point-wise estimate for $e_\varepsilon(u_k)$ in the regions where compactness fails, which also implies the $L^{2,1}$ quantization in the bubbling process. Our second main result consists in applying the method developed in a previous joint paper with T. Rivi\`ere to study the upper-semi-continuity of the extended Morse index to sequences of critical points of $E_{\epsilon}$: given a sequence of critical points $u_{\varepsilon_k}:\Sigma\to \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ of $E_\varepsilon$ that converges in the bubble tree sense to a harmonic map $u_\infty\in W^{1,2}(\Sigma,{S}^{n})$ and bubbles $v^i_{\infty}:\mathbb{R}^2\to {S}^{n}$, we show that the extended Morse indices of the maps $v^i,u_\infty$ control the extended Morse index of the sequence $u_{\varepsilon_k}$ for $k$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>
