      <title>Observational constraints on mutated hilltop inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, a single field inflationary model driven by a mutated hilltop potential, as a subclass of the hilltop models of inflation, is investigated. In order to constrain the parameter space of the model, the $r-n_{\rm s}$ constraint of Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 data as well as the reheating parameters such as the duration $N_{\rm{re}}$, the temperature $T_{\rm{re}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{re}}$, are employed. In addition, a model independent bound on the duration of the radiation dominated (RD) era $N_{\rm{rd}}$ is applied to improve the parameter space. Furthermore, the density spectra of relic gravitational waves (GWs) in light of the sensitivity domains of GW detectors, for specific inflationary durations $N$, are analyzed. Finally, by combining constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), reheating, RD era, and relic GWs, the permissible inflationary duration is constrained to $46\leq N \leq 56$ (95\% CL) and $48.1\leq N\leq 56$ (68\% CL). Moreover, the model parameter $\alpha$ is confined to $0.161\leq\alpha \leq 0.890$ (95\% CL) and $0.217\leq\alpha \leq 0.815$ (68\% CL).</description>

      <title>The redshift dependence of the inferred $H_0$ in a local void solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy number counts suggest that we are located within the Gpc-scale KBC void. The Hubble tension might arise due to gravitationally driven outflow from this void, as explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We explore how the impact of the void on redshift decays at large distances. We define $H_0(z)$ as the present expansion rate $H_0$ that would be inferred from observations in a narrow redshift range centred on $z$. We find $H_0(z)$ in three different ways, all of which give similar results. We then compare these results with the observations of Jia et al., who were careful to minimise the impact of correlations between $H_0$ measurements from data in different redshift bins. We find reasonable agreement with their results for the Gaussian and Exponential void underdensity profiles, although the agreement is less good in the Maxwell-Boltzmann case. The latter profile causes severe disagreement with the observed bulk flow curve at $z &lt; 0.1$ (Mazurenko et al.), so the tension with higher redshift data further highlights that the deepest part of the KBC void is probably near its centre. The observations show a decline of $H_0(z)$ towards the background $Planck$ value in qualitative agreement with the considered models, even if we use a larger void. The good overall agreement with the recent results of Jia et al. suggests that the local supervoid evident from the galaxy luminosity density out to a Gpc might also solve the Hubble tension while retaining a low background $H_0$ consistent with $Planck$ data, assuming enhanced structure formation on $&gt;100$ Mpc scales.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Cosmology: A Route to Accurate Inference of Dark Energy Beyond CPL Parametrization from XG Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern cosmology is understanding the nature of dark energy and its evolution throughout the history of the Universe. Dark energy is commonly modeled as a perfect fluid with a time-varying equation-of-state parameter, w(z), often modeled under CPL parametrization using two parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In this study, we explore both parametric and non-parametric methods to reconstruct the dark energy Equation of State (EoS) using Gravitational Wave (GW) sources, with and without electromagnetic (EM) counterparts called as bright sirens and dark sirens respectively. In the parametric approach, we extend the widely used $w_0$-$w_a$ model by introducing an additional term, $w_b$, to better capture the evolving dynamics of dark energy up to high redshift which is accessible from GW sources. This extension provides increased flexibility in modeling the EoS and enables a more detailed investigation of dark energy's evolution. Our analysis indicates that, with five years of observation time and a $75\%$ duty cycle using Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, it will be possible to measure the dark energy EoS with remarkable precision better than any other cosmological probes in the coming years from bright standard sirens using multi-messenger avenue. These findings highlight the potential of GW observations in synergy with EM telescopes to offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy, overcoming the current limitations in cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion-like particles with SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study prospects to detect axion-like particles (ALPs) with the upcoming near-infrared telescope SPHEREx. The signal under investigation is the ALP decay into two photons. Assuming dark matter (DM) to be in the form of ALPs, we analyze the signal from the DM halos of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Milky Way. We find that SPHEREx can significantly improve current limits on the axion-photon coupling in the 0.5-3 eV ALP mass range.</description>

      <title>Towards detecting Primordial non-Gaussianity in the CMB using Spherical Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel application of spherical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect primordial non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a key probe of inflationary dynamics. While effective, traditional estimators encounter computational challenges, especially when considering summary statistics beyond the bispectrum. We propose spherical CNNs as an alternative, directly analysing full-sky CMB maps to overcome limitations in previous machine learning (ML) approaches that relied on data summaries. By training on simulated CMB maps with varying amplitudes of non-Gaussianity, our spherical CNN models show promising alignment with optimal error bounds of traditional methods, albeit at lower-resolution maps. While we explore several different architectures, results from DeepSphere CNNs most closely match the Fisher forecast for Gaussian test sets under noisy and masked conditions. Our study suggests that spherical CNNs could complement existing methods of non-Gaussianity detection in future datasets, provided additional training data and parameter tuning are applied. We discuss the potential for CNN-based techniques to scale with larger data volumes, paving the way for applications to future CMB data sets.</description>

      <title>The DESI-Lensing Mock Challenge: large-scale cosmological analysis of 3x2-pt statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current generation of large galaxy surveys will test the cosmological model by combining multiple types of observational probes. Realising the statistical promise of these new datasets requires rigorous attention to all aspects of analysis including cosmological measurements, modelling, covariance and parameter likelihood. In this paper we present the results of an end-to-end simulation study designed to test the analysis pipeline for the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 galaxy redshift dataset and separate weak gravitational lensing information from the Kilo-Degree Survey, Dark Energy Survey and Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey. Our analysis employs the 3x2-pt correlation functions including cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing, together with the projected correlation function of the spectroscopic DESI lenses. We build realistic simulations of these datasets including galaxy halo occupation distributions, photometric redshift errors, weights, multiplicative shear calibration biases and magnification. We calculate the analytical covariance of these correlation functions including the Gaussian, noise and super-sample contributions, and show that our covariance determination agrees with estimates based on the ensemble of simulations. We use a Bayesian inference platform to demonstrate that we can recover the fiducial cosmological parameters of the simulation within the statistical error margin of the experiment, investigating the sensitivity to scale cuts. This study is the first in a sequence of papers in which we present and validate the large-scale 3x2-pt cosmological analysis of DESI-Y1.</description>

      <title>Probing Environmental Dependence of High-Redshift Galaxy Properties with the Marked Correlation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hierarchical structure formation, correlations between galaxy properties and their environments reveal important clues about galaxy evolution, emphasizing the importance of measuring these relationships. We probe the environmental dependence of Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) properties in the redshift range of $3$ to $5$ using marked correlation function statistics with galaxy samples from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope U-band surveys. We find that the UV magnitude and color of magnitude-selected LBG samples are strongly correlated with their environment, making these properties effective tracers of it. In contrast, the star formation rate and stellar mass of LBGs exhibit a weak environmental dependence. For UV magnitudes and color, the correlation is stronger in brighter galaxy samples across all redshifts and extends to scales far beyond the size of typical dark matter halos. This suggests that within a given sample, LBGs with high UV magnitudes or colors are more likely to form pairs at these scales than predicted by the two-point angular correlation function. Moreover, the amplitude of the marked correlation function is generally higher for LBG samples compared to that of $z \sim 0$ galaxies from previous studies.We also find that for LBG samples selected by the same absolute threshold magnitude or average halo mass, the correlation between UV magnitudes and the environment generally becomes more pronounced as the redshift decreases. On the other hand, for samples with the same effective large-scale bias at $z\sim 4$ and $5$, the marked correlation functions are similar on large scales.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Multipoles in Galaxy Surveys Part I: How Inferences Depend on Source Counts and Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to constructing and fitting dipoles and higher-order multipoles in synthetic galaxy samples over the sky. Within our Bayesian paradigm, we illustrate that this technique is robust to masked skies, allowing us to make credible inferences about the relative contributions of each multipole. We also show that dipoles can be recovered in surveys with small footprints, determining the requisite source counts required for concrete estimation of the dipole parameters. This work is motivated by recent probes of the cosmic dipole in galaxy catalogues. Namely, the kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background, as arising from the motion of our heliocentric frame at $\approx 370\ \text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, implies that an analogous dipole should be observed in the number counts of galaxies in flux-density-limited samples. Recent studies have reported a dipole aligning with the kinematic dipole but with an anomalously large amplitude. Accordingly, our new technique will be important as forthcoming galaxy surveys are made available and for revisiting previous data.</description>

      <title>Testing inhomogeneous cosmography in our cosmic neighborhood using CosmicFlows-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of the general cosmographic expansion of the luminosity distance is studied in a model of our cosmic neighborhood based on publicly available density and velocity fields obtained from CosmicFlows-4 data. The study confirms earlier findings that indicate divergence of the expansion at low redshifts, well before $z\sim 0.1$. By being based on a realistically placed observer in a model constructed from a real map of our cosmic neighborhood, the presented results firmly establish that the range of convergence must be an important focus when using the general cosmographic expansion. The study also highlights the loss of information we face when using the traditional cosmographic expansion based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker models. Specifically, sky maps of effective Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters showing strong fluctuations of these across the sky are presented. These fluctuations and their meaning cannot be established using the framework of standard cosmology. It is suggested that the general cosmographic expansion should be studied at higher order and in recast forms to scrutinize the possibility of obtaining convergence at higher redshift. In addition, the general cosmographic expansion in its current form may have faster rate of convergence when applied to other datasets. It is therefore suggested that the use of general cosmographic expansions should be accompanied by realistic assessments of the expansion's precision for the given dataset, e.g. by employing the modeling procedure used here to make a synthetic model universe based on the data.
  A poor convergence does not necessarily mean that the information extracted by fitting data to the general cosmographic expansion is useless. It simply means that we must be careful when interpreting the results and e.g. consider what scales the expansion coefficients are probing.</description>

      <title>Can quasars, triggered by mergers, account for NANOGrav's stochastic gravitational wave background?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) recently discovered by several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments is consistent with arising from a population of coalescing super-massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The amplitude of the background is somewhat higher than expected in most previous population models or from the local mass density of SMBHs. SMBHBs are expected to be produced in galaxy mergers, which are also thought to trigger bright quasar activity. Under the assumptions that (i) a fraction $f_{bin} \sim 1$ of all quasars are associated with SMBHB mergers, (ii) the typical quasar lifetime is $t_{Q} \sim 10^{8} yr$, and (iii) adopting Eddington ratios $f_{Edd} \sim 0.3$ for the luminosity of bright quasars, we compute the GWB associated directly with the empirically measured quasar luminosity function (QLF). This approach bypasses the need to model the cosmological evolution of SMBH or galaxy mergers from simulations or semi-analytical models. We find a GWB amplitude approximately matching the value measured by NANOGrav. Our results are consistent with most quasars being associated with SMBH binaries and being the sources of the GWB, and imply a joint constraint on $t_{Q}$, $f_{Edd}$ and the typical mass ratio $q \equiv M_{2}/M_{1}$. The GWB in this case would be dominated by relatively distant $\sim 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ SMBHs at $z \approx 2 - 3$, at the peak of quasar activity. Similarly to other population models, our results remain in tension with the local SMBH mass density.</description>

      <title>DESI and SNe: Dynamical Dark Energy, $\Omega_m$ Tension or Systematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) observations, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe), have led to statistically significant dynamical dark energy (DDE) claims. In this letter we reconstruct $\Lambda$CDM parameter $\Omega_m$ from the $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmologies advocated by the DESI collaboration. We identify i) a mild increasing $\Omega_m$ trend at high redshifts and ii) a sharp departure from $\Lambda$CDM at low redshift. The latter, which is statistically significant, is driven by SNe that are $1.9 \sigma- 2.5 \sigma$ discrepant with DESI full-shape galaxy clustering in overlapping redshift ranges. We identify a low redshift subsample of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SNe sample that is discrepant with DESI at $3.4 \sigma$ despite both observables probing the same effective redshift. This ``$\Omega_m$ tension'' may point to unexplored systematics. SNe and BAO/full-shape modeling should not disagree on $\Omega_m$ at the same effective redshift. If they do, DDE claims are premature.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of the NANOgrav Hellings-Downs as a window into new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have recently provided strong evidence for the signal of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz-frequency band. These experiments have shown a statistical preference for the Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation between pulsars, which is widely regarded as a definitive signature of the SGWB. Using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we perform a comparative Bayesian analysis of four different models that go beyond the standard cosmological framework and influence the overlap reduction function. Specifically, we analyze ultralight vector dark matter (DM), spin-2 ultralight DM, massive gravity, and a folded non-Gaussian component to the SGWB. We find that the spin-2 ultralight DM and the massive gravity model are statistically equivalent to the HD prediction, and there is weak evidence in favor of the non-Gaussian component and the ultralight vector DM model. We also perform a non-parametric test using the Genetic Algorithms, which suggests a weak deviation from the HD curve. However, improved data quality is required before drawing definitive conclusions.</description>

      <title>Newest measurements of Hubble constant from DESI 2024 BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we use the latest results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey to measure the Hubble constant. Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observations released by the DESI survey, allow us to determine $H_0$ from the first principles. Our method is purely data-driven and relies on unanchored luminosity distances reconstructed from SN Ia data and $H(z)$ reconstruction from cosmic chronometers. Thus it circumvents calibrations related to the value of the sound horizon size at the baryon drag epoch or intrinsic luminosity of SN Ia. We find $H_0=68.4^{+1.0}_{-0.8}~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$ at 68% C.L., which provides the Hubble constant at an accuracy of 1.3% with minimal assumptions. Our assessments of this fundamental cosmological quantity using the BAO data spanning the redshift range $z=0.51-2.33$ agree very well with Planck's results and TRGB results within $1\sigma$. This result is still in a $4.3\sigma$ tension with the results of the Supernova H0 for the Equation of State (SH0ES).</description>

      <title>COZMIC. III. Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations of SIDM with Suppressed Initial Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present eight cosmological dark matter (DM)--only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way-like system that include suppression of the linear matter power spectrum $P(k)$, and/or velocity-dependent DM self-interactions, as the third installment of the COZMIC suite. We consider a model featuring a massive dark photon that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark fermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter perturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which ultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a velocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a cross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first time, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal evolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with present-day virial masses below $\approx 10^9~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$. In simulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass (sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of core-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression. In particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints almost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less extreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\approx 20\%$ of subhalos and $\approx 5\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$, and also increase the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos relative to SIDM. These results reveal a complex interplay between early and late-universe DM physics, revealing new discovery scenarios in the context of upcoming small-scale structure measurements.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Strongly-Interacting Dark Matter from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-detection searches for dark matter are insensitive to dark matter particles that have large interactions with ordinary matter, which are stopped in the atmosphere or the Earth's crust before reaching terrestrial detectors. We use ``dark'' calibration images taken with the HgCdTe detectors in the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to derive novel constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that scatter off electrons. We supplement the JWST analysis pipeline with additional masks to remove pixels with high-energy background events. For a 0.4% subcomponent of dark matter that interacts with an ultralight dark photon, we disfavor all previously allowed parameter space at high cross sections, and constrain some parameter regions for subcomponent fractions as low as $\sim$0.01%.</description>

      <title>Redshift tomography of the kinematic matter dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipole anisotropy induced by our peculiar motion in the sky distribution of cosmologically distant sources is an important consistency test of the standard FLRW cosmology. In this work, we formalize how to compute the kinematic matter dipole in redshift bins. Apart from the usual terms arising from angular aberration and flux boosting, there is a contribution from the boosting of the redshifts that becomes important when considering a sample selected on observed redshift, leading to non-vanishing correction terms. We discuss examples and provide expressions to incorporate arbitrary redshift selection functions. We also discuss the effect of redshift measurement uncertainties in this context, in particular in upcoming surveys for which we provide estimates of the correction terms. Depending on the shape of a sample's redshift distribution and on the applied redshift cuts, the correction terms can become substantial, even to the degree that the direction of the dipole is reversed. Lastly, we discuss how cuts on variables correlated with observed redshift, such as color, can induce additional correction terms.</description>

      <title>How the cool-core population transitions from galaxy groups to massive clusters: A comparison of the largest Magneticum simulation with eROSITA, XMM-Newton, Chandra and LOFAR observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our aim is to understand how the interplay between AGN feedback and merge processes can effectively turn cool-core galaxy clusters into hot-core clusters in the modern universe. Additionally, we also aim to clarify which parameters of the AGN feedback model used in simulations can cause an excess of feedback at the scale of galaxy groups while not efficiently suppressing star formation at the scale of galaxy clusters. To obtain robust statistics of the cool-core population, we compare the modern Universe snapshot (z=0.25) of the largest Magneticum simulation (Box2b/hr) with the eROSITA eFEDS survey and Planck SZ-selected clusters observed with XMM-Newton. Additionally, we compare the AGN feedback injected by the simulation in radio mode with Chandra observations of X-ray cavities, and LOFAR observations of radio emission. We confirm a decreasing trend in cool-core fractions towards the most massive galaxy clusters, which is well reproduced by the Magneticum simulations. This evolution is connected with an increased merge activity that injects high-energy particles into the core region, but it also requires thermalization and conductivity to enhance mixing through the ICM core, where both factors are increasingly efficient towards the high mass end. On the other hand, AGN feedback remains as the dominant factor at the scale of galaxy groups, while its relative impact decreases towards the most massive clusters. The problems suppressing star formation in simulations are not caused by low AGN feedback efficiencies. They root in the definition of the black hole sphere of influence used to distribute the feedback, which decreases as density and accretion rate increase. Actually, a decreasing AGN feedback efficiency towards low-mass galaxy groups is required to prevent overheating.</description>

      <title>Super-exponential Primordial Black Hole Production via Delayed Vacuum Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a cosmological first-order phase transition occurs sufficiently slowly, delayed vacuum decay may lead to the formation of primordial black holes. Here we consider a simple model as a case study of how the abundance of the produced black holes depends on the model's input parameters. We demonstrate, both numerically and analytically, that the black hole abundance is controlled by a double, ``super''-exponential dependence on the three-dimensional Euclidean action over temperature at peak nucleation. We show that a modified expansion rate during the phase transition, such as one driven by an additional energy density component, leads to a weaker dependence on the underlying model parameters, but maintains the same super-exponential structure. We argue that our findings generalize to any framework of black hole production via delayed vacuum decay.</description>

      <title>Cosmic reverberations on a constrained $ f(Q,T) $-model of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct an isotropic cosmological model in the $ f(Q, T) $ theory of gravity in the frame of a flat FLRW spacetime being $ Q $ the non-metricity tensor and $ T $ the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The gravity function is taken to be a quadratic equation, $ f(Q, T)=\zeta Q^2 + \gamma T $, where $ \zeta&lt;0 $ and $ \gamma $ are the arbitrary constants. We constrain the model parameters $ \alpha $ and $ H_0 $ using the recent observational datasets: the Hubble dataset (OHD), the Pantheon dataset of $ 1048 $ points, and the joint dataset (OHD + Pantheon). The universe model transits from an early deceleration state to an acceleration in late times. This model also provides the ekpyrotic phase of the universe on the high redshift $ z&gt;12.32 $. In this model, the Big Bang is described as a collision of branes, and thus, the Big Bang is not the beginning of time. Before the Big Bang, there is an ekpyrotic phase with the equation of state $ \omega &gt;&gt; 1 $. In late times, the undeviating Hubble measurements reduce the $ H_0 $ tension in the reconstructed $ f(Q, T) $ function. Additionally, we study various physical parameters of the model. Finally, our model describes a quintessence dark energy model at later times.</description>

      <title>Stability of Superconducting Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of superconducting strings as bound states of strings and fermion zero modes at both the classical and quantum levels. The dynamics of these superconducting strings can result in a stable configuration, known as a vorton. We mainly focus on global strings, but the majority of the discussion can be applied to local strings. Using lattice simulations, we study the classical dynamics of superconducting strings and confirm that they relax to the vorton configuration through Nambu-Goldstone boson radiation, with no evidence of over-shooting that would destabilize the vorton. We explore the tunneling of fermion zero modes out of the strings. Both our classical analysis and quantum calculations yield consistent results: the maximum energy of the zero mode significantly exceeds the fermion mass, in contrast to previous literature. Additionally, we introduce a world-sheet formalism to evaluate the decay rate of zero modes into other particles, which constitute the dominant decay channel. We also identify additional processes that trigger zero-mode decay due to non-adiabatic changes of the string configuration. In these decay processes, the rates are suppressed by the curvature of string loops, with exponential suppression for large masses of the final states. We further study the scattering with light charged particles surrounding the string core produced by the zero-mode current and find that a wide zero-mode wavefunction can enhance vorton stability.</description>

      <title>Axion strings from string axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A favored scenario for axions to be dark matter is for them to form a cosmic string network that subsequently decays, allowing for a tight link between the axion mass and relic abundance. We discuss an example in which the axion is protected from quantum gravity effects that would spoil its ability to solve the strong CP problem: namely a string theoretic axion arising from gauge symmetry in warped extra dimensions. Axion strings arise following the first-order Randall-Sundrum compactification phase transition, forming at the junctions of three bubbles during percolation. Their tensions are at the low scale associated with the warp factor, and are parametrically smaller than the usual field-theory axion strings, relative to the scale of their decay constant. Simulations of string network formation by this mechanism must be carried out to see whether the axion mass-relic density relation depends on the new parameters in the theory.</description>

      <title>Minimal Dirac seesaw dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal Type-I Dirac seesaw which accommodates a thermal scalar dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a CP symmetry, without introducing any additional field beyond the ones taking part in the seesaw. A $Z_4$ symmetry is introduced to realise the tree level Dirac seesaw while the Majorana mass terms are prevented by an unbroken global lepton number symmetry. While the spontaneous $Z_4$ breaking together with electroweak symmetry breaking lead to the generation of light Dirac neutrino mass, it also results in the formation of domain walls. These cosmologically catastrophic walls can be made to annihilate away by introducing bias terms while also generating stochastic gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments like LISA, BBO, $\mu$-ARES etc. The scalar DM parameter space can be probed at direct and indirect search experiments. Light Dirac neutrinos also enhance the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The model can also explain the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Ekpyrosis in Quantum Gravitational Anisotropic Bouncing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the isotropization of the universe starting from potentially large anisotropies in the bouncing models using the ekpyrotic mechanism. As an example of a concrete non-singular bouncing mechanism, we consider the effective description of loop quantum cosmology for Bianchi-I and Bianchi-IX spacetimes for ekpyrotic and ekpyrotic-like potentials. For both of these spacetimes the cosmological singularity is resolved via multiple short-duration non-singular bounces. We perform a large number of numerical simulations for a wide range of initial conditions and find that the relative strength of the anisotropies at the end of the bounce regime is noticeably reduced in more than $90\%$ of the simulations, providing strong evidence for the isotropization ability of the ekpyrotic potentials. While the ekpyrosis phase in all the simulations is found to be rather short-lived, isotropization occurs over cycles of rapid non-singular bounces in the Planck regime via enhancement of the contribution of the (isotropic) energy density relative to the anisotropies at the bounces. Achieving isotropization is found to be easier in Bianchi-I spacetimes when compared to Bianchi-IX spacetimes. Our results demonstrate that, while ekpyrosis might itself be insufficient to tame anisotropies at a single bounce, it can be significant when coupled with non-singular cycles in the bounce regime.</description>

Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis is compelling yet challenging to probe because of the high energy physics involved. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be realized generically with low-energy new physics without supersymmetry while producing detectable gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by parametric resonance of a light scalar field. In viable benchmark models, the scalar has a mass of ${\cal O}(0.1-10)$ GeV, yielding GWs with peak frequencies of ${\cal O}(10-100)$ Hz. This study further reveals a new complementarity between upcoming LIGO-frequency GW detectors and laboratory searches across multiple frontiers of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing $f(Q)$ Gravity Studies: Observational Cosmology through Deep Learning and Bayesian Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most exciting elements of cosmology is researching the potential of anisotropy in the early cosmos. We examine the expansion of the cosmos over time using an anisotropic Bianchi type-I spacetime subjected to the $f(Q)$ gravity. We do this by limiting the number of cosmological parameters used. The approach, we used is known as CoLFI, which stands for "Estimating Cosmological Parameters with deep learning." This paper presents a revolutionary deep learning-based technique to the parameter inference. The deep learning methodology clearly outperforms the MCMC method in terms of best-fit values, parameter errors, and correlations between parameters. This is the result of comparing the two different ways. Moreover, we obtained the transition redshift $z_{t} = 0.63$ which leads the transitioning model of the Universe from early deceleration to current acceleration phase. The dynamics of jerk parameter and validation of energy conditions of the model are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasars discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic rays begin to reveal their secrets at energies above 5 EeV. Beyond this characteristic energy, known as the spectral "ankle", the arrival-direction data from the Pierre Auger Observatory show anisotropy on large angular scales of increasing amplitude with energy. This discovery provides observational evidence that cosmic rays beyond the ankle originate outside the Milky Way, as expected from the weak Galactic confinement and the high luminosity required for the sources. Synthetic models of extragalactic source populations emitting fully ionized atoms have allowed us to reproduce the cosmic-ray flux beyond the ankle for almost a decade. These models capture the various slope breaks in the spectrum at ultra-high energies, including the flux suppression at ${\sim}\,$45 EeV and the recently measured feature at ${\sim}\,$15 EeV, known as the spectral "instep". Such slope breaks are understood as changes in nuclear composition, with the average atomic mass increasing with energy. The population of astrophysical sources responsible for accelerating these nuclei remains unidentified, although serious contenders have been identified. Particularly instructive are the latest searches at the highest energies for anisotropies correlated with the flux patterns expected from galaxies outside the Local Group, which are approaching $5\,\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Age: Star and Galaxy formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Dark Ages mark a pivotal era of the universe's evolution, transitioning from a neutral, opaque medium to the emergence of the first stars and galaxies that initiated cosmic reionization. This study examines the thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), molecular hydrogen cooling, and gravitational collapse that led to structure formation. Key emission lines, such as Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha $) and [C II] 158 $\mu m$, are analyzed as tracers of star formation, metallicity, and IGM conditions. Simulations highlight Ly$\alpha $ scattering profiles and [C II] emission as critical diagnostics of early galaxy evolution. The findings provide a theoretical framework to interpret high-redshift observations, advancing our understanding of the universe's transition from darkness to illumination.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytic Modeling of Dark Matter Subhalo Encounters with Thin Stellar Streams: Statistical Predictions for GD-1-like Streams in CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams from disrupted globular clusters are dynamically cold structures that are sensitive to perturbations from dark matter subhalos, allowing them in principle to trace the dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. We model, within the context of $\Lambda$CDM, the likelihood of dark matter subhalos to produce a significant feature in a GD-1-like stream and analyze the properties of such subhalos. We generate a large number of realizations of the subhalo population within a Milky Way mass host halo, accounting for tidal stripping and dynamical friction, using the semi-analytic code SatGen. The subhalo distributions are combined with a GD-1-like stream model, and the impact of subhalos that pass close to the stream are modeled with Gala. We find that subhalos with masses in the range $5\times 10^6 M_{\odot} - 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at the time of the stream-subhalo encounter, corresponding to masses of about $4 \times 10^7 M_{\odot} - 8 \times 10^8 M_{\odot}$ at the time of infall, are the likeliest to produce gaps in a GD-1-like stream. We find that gaps occur on average $\sim$1.8 times per realization of the host system. These gaps have typical widths of $\sim(7 - 27)$ deg and fractional underdensities of $\sim (10 - 30)\%$, with larger gaps being caused by more-massive subhalos. The stream-subhalo encounters responsible for these have impact parameters $(0.1 - 1.5)$ kpc and relative velocities $\sim(170 - 410)$ km/s. For a larger host-halo mass, the number of subhalos increases, as do their typical velocities, inducing a corresponding increase in the number of significant stream-subhalo encounters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply and extend standard tools for void statistics to cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations with numerical relativity (NR). We obtain a simulated void catalogue without Newtonian approximations, using a new watershed void finder which operates on fluid-based NR simulations produced with the Einstein Toolkit. We compare and contrast measures of void size and void fraction, and compare radial stacked density profiles to empirically-derived Hamaus-Sutter-Wandelt (HSW) density profiles and profiles based on distance to void boundaries. We recover statistics roughly consistent with Newtonian N-body simulations where such a comparison is meaningful. We study variation of dynamical spatial curvature and local expansion explicitly demonstrating the spatial fluctuations of these quantities in void regions. We find that voids in our simulations expand ~10-30% faster than the global average and the spatial curvature density parameter in the centre of voids reaches ~60-80%.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation (emulator) used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;=8% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, making it particularly relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>

      <title>Bye-bye, Local-in-matter-density Bias: The Statistics of the Halo Field Are Poorly Determined by the Local Mass Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bias models relating the dark matter field to the spatial distribution of halos are widely used in current cosmological analyses. Many models predict halos purely from the local Eulerian matter density, yet bias models in perturbation theory require other local properties. We assess the validity of assuming that only the local dark matter density can be used to predict the number density of halos in a model-independent way and in the non-perturbative regime. Utilising $N$-body simulations, we study the properties of the halo counts field after spatial voxels with near-equal dark matter density have been permuted. If local-in-matter-density biasing were valid, the statistical properties of the permuted and un-permuted fields would be indistinguishable since both represent equally fair draws of the stochastic biasing model. If the Lagrangian radius is greater than approximately half the voxel size and for halos less massive than $\sim10^{15}\,h^{-1}{\rm\,M_\odot}$, we find the permuted halo field has a scale-dependent bias with greater than 25% more power on scales relevant for current surveys. These bias models remove small-scale power by not modelling correlations between neighbouring voxels, which substantially boosts large-scale power to conserve the field's total variance. This conclusion is robust to the choice of initial conditions and cosmology. Assuming local-in-matter-density halo biasing cannot, therefore, reproduce the distribution of halos across a large range of scales and halo masses, no matter how complex the model. One must either allow the biasing to be a function of other quantities and/or remove the assumption that neighbouring voxels are statistically independent.</description>

      <title>Constraining Post-Newtonian Parameters with the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN) approach is the default framework for performing precision tests of gravity in nearby astrophysical systems. In recent works we have extended this approach for cosmological applications, and in this paper we use observations of the anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the time variation of the PPN parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ between last scattering and the present day. We find their time-averages over cosmological history should be within $\sim 20\%$ of their values in GR, with $\bar{\alpha}=0.89^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ and $\bar{\gamma}=0.90^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. We also constrain the time derivatives of these parameters, and find that their present-day values should be within a factor of two of the best Solar System constraints. Many of these results have no counter-part from Solar System observations, and are entirely new constraints on the gravitational interaction. In all cases, we find that the data strongly prefer $\bar{\alpha}\simeq \bar{\gamma}$, meaning that observers would typically find local gravitational physics to be compatible with GR, despite considerable variation of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ being allowed over cosmic history. This study lays the groundwork for future precision tests of gravity that combine observations made over all cosmological and astrophysical scales of length and time.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results II. Updated constraints on the CO(1-0) power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on the cosmological 3D power spectrum of carbon monoxide CO(1-0) emission in the redshift range $2.4$-$3.4$. The constraints are derived from the two first seasons of Carbon monOxide Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder line-intensity mapping observations aiming to trace star-formation during the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly. These results improve on the previous Early Science (ES) results through both increased data volume and improved data processing methodology. On the methodological side, we now perform cross-correlations between groups of detectors (''feed-groups''), as opposed to cross-correlations between single feeds, and this new feed-group pseudo power spectrum (FGPXS) is constructed to be more robust against systematic effects. In terms of data volume, the effective mapping speed is significantly increased due to an improved observational strategy as well as better data selection methodology. The updated spherically- and field-averaged FGPXS, $\tilde{C}(k)$, is consistent with zero, at a probability-to-exceed of around $34\,\%$, with an excess of $2.7\,\sigma$ in the most sensitive bin. Our power spectrum estimate is about an order of magnitude more sensitive in our six deepest bins across ${0.09\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 0.73\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$, as compared to the feed-feed pseudo power spectrum (FPXS) of COMAP ES. Each of these bins individually constrains the CO power spectrum to ${kP_\mathrm{CO}(k)&lt; 2400-4900\,\mathrm{\mu K^2 Mpc^{2}}}$ at $95\,\%$ confidence. To monitor potential contamination from residual systematic effects, we analyze a set of 312 difference-map null tests and find that these are consistent with the instrumental noise prediction. In sum, these results provide the strongest direct constraints on the cosmological 3D CO(1-0) power spectrum published to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our previous work (Proukakis {\em et al.}, Phys.~Rev.~D~108,~083513 (2023)) on the dynamics of bosonic, non-relativistic and self-interacting dark matter that simultaneously contains both a ``fuzzy'' low-momentum component and one with higher momenta that may be well approximated as a collection of distinct particles and described by a corresponding phase-space distribution. Starting from the non-relativistic Schwinger-Keldysh action and working beyond leading-order in the Keldysh basis fields, encoding stochastic fluctuations of the slow modes and all fluctuations of the fast modes, we obtain stochastic self-consistently coupled Gross-Pitaevskii, collisional Boltzmann kinetic and Poisson equations. Our final set of equations, which feature various collisional (dissipative and scattering) contributions and two corresponding independent stochastic force terms, are consistent with generalized fluctuation-dissipation type relations in the limit of thermal equilibrium between the particles.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Pressure Support in Galaxy Clusters -- Impact of the Hydrodynamical Solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amount of turbulent pressure in galaxy clusters is still debated, especially as for the impact of the dynamical state and the hydro-method used for simulations. We study the turbulent pressure fraction in the intra cluster medium of massive galaxy clusters. We aim to understand the impact of the hydrodynamical scheme, analysis method, and dynamical state on the final properties of galaxy clusters from cosmological simulations. We perform non-radiative simulations of a set of zoom-in regions of seven galaxy clusters with Meshless Finite Mass (MFM) and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). We use three different analysis methods based on: $(i)$ the deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium, $(ii)$ the solenoidal velocity component obtained by a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, and $(iii)$ the small-scale velocity obtained through a multi-scale filtering approach. We split the sample of simulated clusters into active and relaxed clusters. Our simulations predict an increased turbulent pressure fraction for active compared to relaxed clusters. This is especially visible for the velocity-based methods. For these, we also find increased turbulence for the MFM simulations compared to SPH, consistent with findings from more idealized simulations. The predicted non-thermal pressure fraction varies between a few percent for relaxed clusters and $\approx13\%$ for active ones within the cluster center and increases towards the outskirts. No clear trend with redshift is visible. Our analysis quantitatively assesses the importance played by the hydrodynamical scheme and the analysis method to determine the non-thermal/turbulent pressure fraction. While our setup is relatively simple (non-radiative runs), our simulations show agreement with previous, more idealized simulations, and make a step further toward the understanding of turbulence.</description>

      <title>The picasso gas model: Painting intracluster gas on gravity-only simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce picasso, a model designed to predict thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium based on the properties of halos in gravity-only simulations. The predictions result from the combination of an analytical gas model, mapping gas properties to the gravitational potential, and of a machine learning model to predict the model parameters for individual halos based on their scalar properties, such as mass and concentration. Once trained, the model can be applied to make predictions for arbitrary potential distributions, allowing its use with flexible inputs such as N-body particle distributions or radial profiles. We present the model, and train it using pairs of gravity-only and hydrodynamic simulations. We show that when trained to learn the mapping from gravity-only to non-radiative hydrodynamic simulations, picasso can make remarkably accurate and precise predictions of intracluster gas thermodynamics, with percent-level bias and $\sim 20 \%$ scatter for $r / R_{500c} \in [0.1,1]$. Training the model on hydrodynamic simulations including sub-resolution physics modeling yields robust predictions as well, albeit with the introduction of a radius-dependent bias and an increase in scatter. We further show that the model can be trained to make accurate predictions from very minimal halo information, down to mass and concentration, at the cost of modestly reduced precision. picasso is made publicly available as a Python package at https://github.com/fkeruzore/picasso, which includes trained models that can be used to make predictions easily and efficiently, in a fully auto-differentiable and hardware-accelerated framework</description>

      <title>Peaks in weak lensing mass maps for cluster astrophysics and cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies can be identified from peaks in weak lensing aperture mass maps constructed from weak lensing shear catalogs. Such purely gravitational cluster selection considerably differs from traditional cluster selections based on baryonic properties of clusters. In this review, we present the basics and applications of weak lensing shear-selected cluster samples. Detailed studies of baryonic properties of shear-selected clusters shed new light on cluster astrophysics. The purely gravitational selection suggests that the selection function can be quantified more easily and robustly, which is crucial for deriving accurate cosmological constraints from the abundance of shear-selected clusters. The recent advance of shear-selected cluster studies is driven by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, in which more than 300 shear-selected clusters with the signal-to-noise ration greater than 5 are identified. It is argued that various systematic effects in the cosmological analysis can be mitigated by carefully choosing the set-up of the analysis, including the choice of the kernel functions and the source galaxy sample.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological data probe massive neutrinos via their effects on the geometry of the Universe and the growth of structure, both of which are degenerate with the late-time expansion history. We clarify the nature of these degeneracies and the individual roles of both probes in neutrino mass inference. Geometry is strongly sensitive to neutrino masses: within $\Lambda$CDM, the primary cosmic microwave background anisotropies alone impose that the matter fraction $\Omega_m$ must increase fivefold with increasing neutrino mass. Moreover, large-scale structure observables, like weak lensing of the CMB, are dimensionless and thus depend not on the matter density (as often quoted) but in fact the matter fraction. We explore the consequential impact of this distinction on the interplay between probes of structure, low-redshift distances, and CMB anisotropies. We derive constraints on the neutrino's masses independently from their suppression of structure and impact on geometry, showing that the latter is at least as important as the former. While the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's recent baryon acoustic oscillation data place stringent bounds largely deriving from their geometric incompatibility with massive neutrinos, all recent type Ia supernova datasets drive marginal preferences for nonzero neutrino masses because they prefer substantially larger matter fractions. Recent CMB lensing data, however, neither exclude neutrinos' suppression of structure nor constrain it strongly enough to discriminate between mass hierarchies. Current data thus evince not a need for modified dynamics of neutrino perturbations or structure growth but rather an inconsistent compatibility with massive neutrinos' impact on the expansion history. We identify two of DESI's measurements that strongly influence its constraints, and we also discuss neutrino mass measurements in models that alter the sound horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and primordial black holes from axion domain walls in level crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nano-Hertz gravitational waves (GWs) emission and the massive primordial black holes (PBHs) formation from the light QCD axion scenario. We consider the axion domain walls formation from the level crossing induced by the mass mixing between the light $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion and axion-like particle. A general mixing case is considered that the heavy and light mass eigenvalues do not necessarily have to coincide with the axion masses. In order to form the domain walls, the axions should start to oscillate slightly before the level crossing. The domain walls must annihilate before dominating the Universe to avoid the cosmological catastrophe. Then we focus our attention on the GWs emission from the domain walls annihilation and the PBHs formation from the domain walls collapse. We show the predicted GWs spectra with the peak frequency $\sim 0.2\, \rm nHz$ and the peak amplitude $\sim 5\times 10^{-9}$, which can be tested by the future pulsar timing array projects. In addition, during the domain walls annihilation, the closed walls could shrink to the Schwarzschild radius and collapse into the PBHs. We find that the PBHs in the mass range of $\mathcal{O}(10^5-10^8) M_\odot$ could potentially form in this scenario and account for a small fraction $\sim 10^{-5}$ of the cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>A sensitivity curve approach to tuning a pulsar timing array in the detection era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) transition into the detection era of the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), it is important for PTA collaborations to review and possibly revise their observing campaigns. The detection of a ''single source'' would be a boon for gravitational astrophysics, as such a source would emit gravitational waves for millions of years in the PTA frequency band. Here we present generic methods for studying the effects of various observational strategies, taking advantage of detector sensitivity curves, i.e., noise-averaged, frequency-domain detection statistics. The statistical basis for these methods is presented along with myriad examples of how to tune a detector towards single, deterministic signals or a stochastic background. We demonstrate that trading observations of the worst pulsars for high cadence campaigns on the best pulsars increases sensitivity to single sources at high frequencies while hedging losses in GWB and single source sensitivity at low frequencies. We also find that sky-targeted observing campaigns yield minimal sensitivity improvements compared with other PTA tuning options. Lastly, we show the importance of the uncorrelated half of the GWB, i.e. the pulsar-term, as an increasingly prominent sources of noise and show the impact of this emerging noise source on various PTA configurations.</description>

      <title>Space-based optical lattice clocks as gravitational wave detectors in search for new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity and performance of space-based Optical Lattice Clocks (OLCs) in detecting gravitational waves, in particular the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) at low frequencies $(10^{-4}, 1) \rm Hz$, which are inaccessible to ground-based detectors. We first analyze the response characteristics of a single OLC detector for SGWB detection and compare its sensitivity with that of Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to longer arm lengths, space-based OLC detectors can exhibit unique frequency responses and enhance the capability to detect SGWB in the low-frequency range, but the sensitivity of a single OLC detector remains insufficient overall compared to LISA. Then, as a preliminary plan, we adopt a method of cross-correlation on two OLC detectors to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This method leverages the uncorrelated origins but statistically similar properties of noise in two detectors while the SGWB signal is correlated between them, thus achieving effective noise suppression and sensitivity enhancement. Future advancements in OLC stability are expected to further enhance their detection performance. This work highlights the potential of OLC detectors as a promising platform for SGWB detection, offering complementary capabilities to LISA, and opening an observational window into more astrophysical sources and the early universe.</description>
