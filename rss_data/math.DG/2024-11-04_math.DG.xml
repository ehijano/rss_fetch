      <title>Homogeneity supermanifolds and homogeneous Darboux theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold, which is more general than most of the approaches to graded manifolds present in the literature. Instead of doing it via ringed spaces and sheaves of graded algebras, we prefer a purely differential geometric language and view gradings as provided by an additional structure on supermanifolds, namely the weight vector field. This gives us a privileged atlas with homogeneous local coordinates. The fact that the transition maps `preserve weights' is then automatic, but weights of homogeneous coordinates may vary from one chart to the other. Moreover, such local homogeneous coordinates may have arbitrary real weights, not only integers. We study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroups, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, and other related concepts. The main achievements in this framework are proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma and a homogeneous analog of the Darboux Theorem.</description>

      <title>Second-order superintegrable systems and Weylian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order (maximally) conformally superintegrable Hamiltonian systems of abundant type are re-examined, revealing their underlying Weylian geometry. This allows one to naturally extend the concept of c-superintegrability from the realm of conformal geometries to that of Weylian manifolds. The resulting structures, in any dimension, are characterised by conformally invariant equations.</description>

      <title>Non-Shrinking Ricci Solitons of cohomogeneity one from quaternionic Hopf fibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of two 3-parameter families of non-Einstein, non-shrinking Ricci solitons: one on $\mathbb{H}^{m+1}$ and one on $\mathbb{HP}^{m+1}\backslash\{*\}$. Each family includes a continuous 1-parameter subfamily of asymptotically paraboloidal (non-collapsed) steady Ricci solitons, with the Jensen sphere as the base. Additionally, we extend this result by proving the existence of a 2-parameter family on $\mathbb{O}^2$, which contains a 1-parameter subfamily of asymptotically paraboloidal steady Ricci solitons based on the Bourguignon--Karcher sphere.</description>

      <title>The Stacey-Roberts Lemma for Banach manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stacey-Roberts Lemma states that the pushforward of a surjective submersion between finite-dimensional manifolds gives rise to a submersion on infinite-dimensional manifolds of smooth mappings by pushforward. This result is foundational for many constructions in infinite-dimensional differential geometry such as the construction of Lie groupoids of smooth mappings. We generalise the Stacey-Roberts Lemma to Banach manifolds which admit smooth partitions of unity. The new approach also remedies an error in the original proof of the result for finite-dimensional target manifolds.</description>

      <title>New minimal surface doublings of the Clifford torus and contributions to questions of Yau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is three-fold. First, we apply a general theorem from our earlier work to produce many new minimal doublings of the Clifford Torus in the round three-sphere. This construction generalizes and unifies prior doubling constructions for the Clifford Torus, producing doublings with catenoidal bridges arranged along parallel copies of torus knots. Ketover has also constructed similar minimal surfaces by min-max methods as suggested by Pitts-Rubinstein, but his methods apply only to surfaces which are lifts of genus two surfaces in lens spaces, while ours are not constrained this way.
  Second, we use this family to prove a new, quadratic lower bound for the number of embedded minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ with prescribed genus. This improves upon bounds recently given by Ketover and Karpukhin-Kusner-McGrath-Stern, and contributes to a question of Yau about the structure of the space of minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ with fixed genus.
  Third, we verify Yau's conjecture for the first eigenvalue of minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ in the following cases. First, for all minimal surface doublings of the equatorial two-sphere constructible by our earlier general theorem. Second, for all the Clifford Torus doublings constructed in this article.</description>

      <title>On Fixed-Point Sets of $\Z_2$-Tori in Positive Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work of Kennard, Khalili Samani, and the last author, they generalize the Half-Maximal Symmetry Rank result of Wilking for torus actions on positively curved manifolds to $\mathbb{Z}_2$-tori with a fixed point. They show that if the rank is approximately one-fourth of the dimension of the manifold, then fixed point set components of small co-rank subgroups of the $\Z_2$-torus are homotopy equivalent to spheres, real projective spaces, complex projective spaces, or lens spaces. In this paper, we lower the bound on the rank of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torus to approximately $n/6$ and $n/8$ and are able to classify either the integral cohomology ring or the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-cohomology ring, respectively, of the fixed point set of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torus.</description>

      <title>Vertical curves and vertical fibers in the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb H$ denote the three-dimensional Heisenberg group. In this paper, we study vertical curves in $\mathbb H$ and fibers of maps $\mathbb H \to \mathbb R^2$ from a metric perspective. We say that a set in $\mathbb H$ is a vertical curve if it satisfies a cone condition with respect to a homogeneous cone with axis $\langle Z \rangle$, the center of $\mathbb H$. This is analogous to the cone condition used to define intrinsic Lipschitz graphs.
  In the first part of the paper, we prove that connected vertical curves are locally biH\"older equivalent to intervals. We also show that the class of vertical curves coincides with the class of intersections of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs satisfying a transversality condition. Unlike intrinsic Lipschitz graphs, the Hausdorff dimension of a vertical curve can vary; we construct vertical curves with Hausdorff dimension either strictly larger or strictly smaller than 2. Consequently, there are intersections of intrinsic Lipschitz graphs with Hausdorff dimension either strictly larger or strictly smaller than 2.
  In the second part of the paper, we consider smooth functions $\beta$ from the unit ball $B$ in $\mathbb H$ to $\mathbb R^2$. We show that, in contrast to the situation in Euclidean space, there are maps such that $\beta$ is arbitrarily close to the projection $\pi$ from $\mathbb H$ to the horizontal plane, but the average $\mathcal{H}^2$ measure of a fiber of $\beta$ in $B$ is arbitrarily small.</description>

      <title>Observability from a measurable set for functions in a Gevrey class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an observability inequality in terms of a measurable set for general Gevrey regular functions. As an application, we establish an observability estimate from a measurable set for sums of Laplace eigenfunctions in a compact and connected boundaryless Riemannian manifold that belongs to the Gevrey class. The estimate has an explicit dependence on the maximal eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Quantization and reduction for torsion free CR manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact torsion free CR manifold $X$ and assume that $X$ admits a compact CR Lie group action $G$. Let $L$ be a $G$-equivariant rigid CR line bundle over $X$. It seems natural to consider the space of $G$-invariant CR sections in the high tensor powers as quantization space, on which a certain weighted $G$-invariant Fourier-Szeg\H{o} operator projects. Under certain natural assumptions, we show that the group invariant Fourier-Szeg\H{o} projector admits a full asymptotic expansion. As an application, if the tensor power of the line bundle is large enough, we prove that quantization commutes with reduction.</description>

Abstract: We propose a slight variant of Ambrosio and Kirchheim's definition of a metric current. We show that with this new definition it is possible to obtain certain volume functionals from Finsler geometry as mass measures of currents. As an application, we obtain a whole family of extendibly convex $n$-volume densities. This family includes the mass* and the circumscribed Riemannian volume densities.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler manifolds with an almost $1/4$-pinched metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct an almost negatively $1/4$-pinched Riemannian metric on a class of compact manifolds recently discovered by Stover and Toledo in [17]. It is known that these manifolds are K\"{a}hler and not locally symmetric. These are the first known examples of not locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifolds admitting such a metric and, via the result of Hernandez [9] and Yau and Zheng [18], these manifolds cannot admit a negatively quarter-pinched Riemannian metric. This metric is also interesting because it is a generalization to the complex hyperbolic setting of the famous pinched metric constructed by Gromov and Thurston in [8].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the quaternionic Jordan form to classify the hypercomplex nilpotent almost abelian Lie algebras in all dimensions and to carry out the complete classification of 12-dimensional hypercomplex almost abelian Lie algebras. Moreover, we determine which 12-dimensional simply connected hypercomplex almost abelian Lie groups admit lattices. Finally, for each integer $n&gt;1$ we construct infinitely many, up to diffeomorphism, $(4n+4)$-dimensional hypercomplex almost abelian solvmanifolds which are completely solvable. These solvmanifolds arise from a distinguished family of monic integer polynomials of degree $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the trajectories of unreduced $\phi$-simple Chaplygin kinetic systems are reparametrizations of horizontal geodesics with respect to a modified Riemannian metric. Furthermore, our proof is constructive and these Riemannian metrics, which are not unique, are obtained explicitly in interesting examples. We also extend these results to $\phi$-simple Chaplygin mechanical systems (not necessarily kinetic).</description>
