      <title>Reduced Forms: Feasibility, Extremality, Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study independent private values auction environments in which the auctioneer's revenue depends nonlinearly on bidders' interim winning probabilities. Our framework accommodates heterogeneity among bidders and places no ad hoc constraints on the mechanisms available to the auctioneer. Within this general setting, we show that feasibility of interim winning probabilities can be tested along a unidimensional curve -- the principal curve -- and use this insight to explicitly characterize the extreme points of the feasible set. We then combine our results on feasibility and extremality to solve for the optimal auction under a natural regularity condition. We show that the optimal mechanism allocates the good based on principal virtual values, which extend Myerson's virtual values to nonlinear settings and are constructed to equalize bidders' marginal revenue along the principal curve. We apply our approach to the classical linear model, settings with endogenous valuations due to ex ante investments, and settings with non-expected utility preferences, where previous results were largely limited either to symmetric environments with symmetric allocations or to two-bidder environments.</description>

      <title>Pricing with a Hidden Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study prior-independent pricing for selling a single item to a single buyer when the seller observes only a single sample from the valuation distribution, while the buyer knows the distribution. Classical robust pricing approaches either rely on distributional statistics, which typically require many samples to estimate, or directly use revealed samples to determine prices and allocations. We show that these two regimes can be bridged by leveraging the buyer's informational advantage: pricing policies that conventionally require the seller to know statistics such as the mean, $L^\eta$-norm, or superquantile can, in our framework, be implemented using only a single hidden sample.
  We introduce hidden pricing mechanisms, in which the seller commits ex ante to a pricing rule based on a single sample that is revealed only after the buyer's participation decision. We show that every concave pricing policy can be implemented in this way. To evaluate performance guarantees, we develop a general reduction for analyzing monotone pricing policies over $\alpha$-regular distributions, enabling a tractable characterization of worst-case instances. Using this reduction, we characterize the optimal monotone hidden pricing mechanisms and compute their approximation ratios; in particular, we obtain an approximation ratio of approximately $0.79$ for monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions. We further establish impossibility results for general concave pricing policies and for all prior-independent mechanisms. Finally, we show that our framework also applies to statistic-based robust pricing, thereby unifying sample-based and statistic-based approaches.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Sparse Win-Lose Bimatrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that computing an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium of a win-lose bimatrix game with constant sparsity is PPAD-hard for inverse-polynomial $\epsilon$. Our result holds for 3-sparse games, which is tight given that 2-sparse win-lose bimatrix games can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Individual and Collective Welfare in Risk Sharing with Many States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study efficient risk sharing among risk-averse agents in an economy with a large, finite number of states. Following a random shock to an initial agreement, agents may renegotiate. If they require a minimal utility improvement to accept a new deal, we show the probability of finding a mutually acceptable allocation vanishes exponentially as the state space grows. This holds regardless of agents' degree of risk aversion. In a two-agent multiple-priors model, we find that the potential for Pareto-improving trade requires that at least one agent's set of priors has a vanishingly small measure. Our results hinge on the ``shape does not matter'' message of high-dimensional isoperimetric inequalities.</description>

      <title>Credit Expansion, Land Speculation, and Low-Interest-Rate Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses the impact of credit expansions arising from decreases in collateral requirements or more expansionary monetary policies on long-term productivity in a model with endogenous growth. Credit expansions associated with relaxation of land collateral financing (capital collateral financing) will be productivity-and growth-retarding (enhancing). Without appropriate financial regulation, expansionary monetary policy may so encourage land speculation using leverage that productive capital investment is decreased; there is a temporary asset boom, but slower economic growth. The generation that experienced the asset price boom is better off, but subsequent generations are worse off because of low growth.</description>

      <title>Who's in? Household-targeted Government Policies and the Role of Financial Literacy in Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how household-targeted government policies influence financial market participation conditional on financial literacy, focusing on potential Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) adoption. Due to the lack of empirical CBDC data, I use the 2012 introduction of retail Treasury bonds in Italy as a proxy to study how financial literacy affects households' likelihood to engage with a new government-backed retail instrument. Using the Bank of Italy's Survey on Household Income and Wealth, I show that households with some but low financial literacy are more likely to participate in the Treasury bond market than other groups following the introduction of the new instrument. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model to study how financial literacy affects CBDC demand through portfolio choice: low-literate households with limited access to risky assets allocate more wealth to CBDC, while high-literate households use risky assets to safeguard against income risk. These results highlight the role of financial literacy in shaping portfolio choices and CBDC adoption.</description>
