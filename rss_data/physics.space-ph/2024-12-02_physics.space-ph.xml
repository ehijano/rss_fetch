      <title>Night-Side Relativistic Electron Precipitation Bursts in the Outer Radiation Belt: Insights from ELFIN and THEMIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic whistler-mode waves play a crucial role in the acceleration and precipitation of radiation belt electrons. Statistical surveys of wave characteristics suggest that these waves should preferentially scatter and precipitate relativistic electrons on the day side. However, the night-side region is expected to be primarily associated with electron acceleration. The recent low-altitude observations reveal relativistic electron precipitation in the night-side region. In this paper, we present statistical surveys of night-side relativistic electron losses due to intense precipitation bursts. We demonstrate that such bursts are associated with storm time substorm injections and are likely related to relativistic electron scattering by ducted whistler-mode waves. We also speculate on the role of injections in creating conditions favorable for relativistic electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>V-band Optoelectronic Oscillator for Earth Observation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) producing a signal at 45.86 GHz is demonstrated that may potentially be utilized in the local oscillator (LO) generation of Earth observation applications such as the microwave sounding (MWS), microwave imaging (MWI) and ice cloud imaging (ICI) missions of METOP 2 of ESA. Preliminary results show that the performance of this lower SWaP OEO system is comparable or in some respects better than the electrical system already used in the MWS, MWS and MWI missions of ESA. Specifically, a sidemode suppression of about 46 dB, a phase noise of -102 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, and frequency stability of 30 kHz in a ten-minute interval is achieved for the 45.86 GHz signal. The OEO is a promising candidate to replace or supplement the electronic systems of phase locked dielectric resonator oscillator and frequency multipliers used currently in Earth observation.</description>

      <title>On the transition from Slow to Fast Wind as Observed in Composition Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solar wind is typically categorized as fast and slow based on the measured speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$). The separation between these two regimes is often set between 400 and 600 km/s without a rigorous definition. Observations of the solar wind's kinetic signatures, chemical makeup, charge state properties, and Alfv\'enicity suggest that such a two-state model may be insufficiently nuanced to capture the relationship between the solar wind and its solar sources. We test this two-state fast/slow solar wind paradigm with heavy ion abundances (X/H) and characterize how the transition between fast and slow wind states impacts heavy ion in the solar wind. We show that (1) the speed at which heavy ion abundances indicate a change between fast and slow solar wind as a function of speed is slower than the speed indicated by the helium abundance; (2) this speed is independent of heavy ion mass and charge state; (3) the abundance at which heavy ions indicate the transition between fast and slow wind is consistent with prior observations of fast wind abundances; (4) and there may be a mass or charge-state dependent fractionation process present in fast wind heavy ion abundances. We infer that (1) identifying slow solar wind as having a speed $v_\mathrm{sw} \lesssim$ 400 km/s may mix solar wind from polar and equatorial sources; (2) He may be impacted by the acceleration necessary for the solar wind to reach the asymptotic fast, non-transient values observed at 1 AU; and (3) heavy ions are fractionated in the fast wind by a yet-to-be-determined mechanism.</description>

      <title>A study of particles acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the damping length of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.</description>

      <title>CME propagation in the dynamically coupled space weather tool: COCONUT + EUHFORIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to present the time-dependent coupling between the coronal model COolfluid COroNal UnsTructured (COCONUT) and the heliospheric forecasting tool EUHFORIA.
  We perform six COCONUT simulations where a flux rope is implemented at the solar surface using either the Titov-D\'emoulin CME model or the Regularized Biot-Savart Laws (RBSL) CME model. At regular intervals, the magnetic field, velocity, temperature, and density of the 2D surface $R_{b}=21.5~\;R_{\odot}$ are saved in boundary files. This series of coupling files is read in a modified version of EUHFORIA to update progressively its inner boundary. After presenting the early stage of the propagation in COCONUT, we examine how the disturbance of the solar corona created by the propagation of flux ropes is transmitted into EUHFORIA. In particular, we consider the thermodynamic and magnetic profiles at L1 and compare them with those obtained at the interface between the two models.
  We demonstrate that the properties of the heliospheric solar wind in EUHFORIA are consistent with those in COCONUT, acting as a direct extension of the coronal domain. Moreover, the disturbances initially created from the propagation of flux ropes in COCONUT continue evolving from the corona in the heliosphere to Earth with a smooth transition at the interface between the two simulations. Looking at the profile of magnetic field components at Earth and different distances from the Sun, we also find that the transient magnetic structures have a self-similar expansion in COCONUT and EUHFORIA. However, the amplitude of the profiles depends on the flux rope model used and its properties, thus emphasizing the important role of the initial properties in solar source regions for accurately predicting the impact of CMEs.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Energy Cascade in Three-Dimensional Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new scale decomposition method to investigate turbulence in wavenumber-frequency space. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations, we show that magnetic fluctuations with time scales longer than the nonlinear time exhibit an inverse cascade toward even smaller frequencies. Low frequency magnetic fluctuations support turbulence, acting as an energy reservoir that is converted into plasma kinetic energy, the latter cascading toward large wavenumbers and frequencies, where it is dissipated. Our results shed new light on the spatio-temporal properties of turbulence, potentially explaining the origin and role of low frequency turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind.</description>

Abstract: The 6th International Symposium on Space Sailing (ISSS 2023) took place on June 5-9, 2023 at the New York City College of Technology, the City University of New York. Since its inauguration in Herrsching (Germany, 2007), the ISSS has been held in New York (USA, 2010), Glasgow (UK, 2013), Kyoto (Japan, 2017) and Aachen (Germany, 2019). During the five-day symposium, participants from 14 countries gathered to discuss recent advances in space sailing, investigating new concepts and designs, describing innovative hardware and enabling technologies, strategies for dynamics and control, and providing updates on testing results for systems under development and future mission applications. As part of the 18 sessions, almost 50 oral presentations were held and, subsequently, 17 papers were submitted for review and publication. This paper aims to give an overview of all the cutting-edge technologies, detailed analysis and promising results shared with the scientific community as part of the event. Following the noteworthy deployment of the world's first solar sail IKAROS in 2010, missions like NanoSail-D2 (2011) and LightSail-2 (2019) have showcased the potential of solar sailing technology through successful demonstrations. Besides highlighting advancements in present and future programs, the symposium was an opportunity to reflect on objectives, design and test results from research centers and universities, as well as illustrate applications for interstellar travel, evaluate degrading performance and suggest alternative solutions for known limitations. The following Symposium is scheduled for early summer 2025 and will be hosted by TU Delft.</description>
