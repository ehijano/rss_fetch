      <title>Causality and stability in relativistic hydrodynamic theory -- a choice to be endured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, it has been indicated that the key features requisite for preserving causality and stability of the popularly existing relativistic hydrodynamic theories, can be translated into each other. It has been shown here, that a generic `fluid frame transformation' including all orders of gradient corrections can recast a stable-causal hydrodynamic theory that (i) only includes fundamental fluid variables (velocity and temperature) but requires to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart, to a theory that is (ii) pathology free in Landau frame but needs newer degrees of freedom. Since frame choice provides the first principle field definitions and degrees of freedom indicate the number of conserved quantities, the causality and stability of a theory seem to require a consensus between the two unless the derivative correction goes to infinity. The key finding of this work is to indicate a connection between these different formalisms, that lead to a causal and stable hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>On the determination of the $D$ meson width in the nuclear medium with the transparency ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the feasibility of the experimental determination of the width of a $D$ meson in a nuclear medium by using the method of the nuclear transparency. The cross section for inclusive production of a $D^+$ in different nuclei is evaluated, taking care of the $D^+$ absorption in the nucleus, or equivalently, the survival probability of the $D^+$ in its way out of the nucleus from the point of production. We use present values of the in medium width of $D$ mesons and calculate ratios of the cross sections for different nuclei to the $^{12} \text{C} $ nucleus as reference. We find ratios of the order of $0.6$ for heavy nuclei, a large deviation from unity, which indicates that the method proposed is adequate to measure this relevant magnitude, so far only known theoretically.</description>

      <title>Correlation between alpha-decay half-lives and symmetry energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the alpha-decay half-lives of 84 &lt;= Z &lt;= 92 even-even nuclei in the semiclassical WKB approximation framework using the density-dependent cluster model and the density distribution described by various Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU (KIDS) models. Main goal of this work is to find a correlation between the alpha-decay half-lives and the stiffness of the symmtery energy. Parameters of KIDS model are determined to reproduce the nuclear data (energy and charge radii of 40Ca, 48Ca and 208Pb) and the neutron star observations including constraints by NICER, tidal deformability from GW170817, and the maximum mass limit of neutron star observations. We use the KIDS models (A-D) which have distinctive values for the parameters controlling the stiffness of the nuclear matter equation of state. We find that the alpha-decay half-lives increase systematically from KIDS-A model to KIDS-D model. This implies a correlation between the alpha-decay half-lives and the symmetry energy. We find that the correlation can be understood from the dependence of the particle distribution in the core and the surface region on the symmetry energy.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double-beta decay in a finite volume from relativistic effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19695v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrinoless double-beta decay process $nn\rightarrow ppee$ within the light Majorana-exchange scenario is studied using the relativistic pionless effective field theory (EFT) in finite-volume cubic boxes with the periodic boundary conditions. Using the low-energy two-nucleon scattering observables from lattice QCD available at $m_\pi=300$, 450, 510, and 806 MeV, the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements are predicted with a precision of 10\%-20\% and their volume dependence is investigated. This is possible thanks to the fact that the leading-order $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be properly renormalized in the relativistic pionless EFT without the uncertain $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ contact term, in contrast to the nonrelativistic case. The predictions for the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements can be directly matched to the LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow ppee$ process at the same pion masses. Therefore, the present results are expected to play a crucial role in the benchmark between the nuclear EFTs and the upcoming LQCD calculations of the $nn\rightarrow pp ee$ process, which would provide a nontrivial test on the predictive power of nuclear EFTs on neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>

      <title>Meson-nucleus bound states in quark meson coupling model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formations of the $K(\bar{K})$, $D(\bar{D})$, and $B(\bar{B})$ meson-nucleus bound states in $^{16}O$, $^{40}Ca$, $^{90}Zr$, $^{197}Au$, and $^{208}Pb$ nucleus are investigated using the quark meson coupling model. The model relies on a mean field description of non-overlapping nucleon bags bound by the self-consistent interactions of scalar ($\sigma$, $\delta$) and vector ($\omega$, $\rho$) mesons with the (anti)quarks inside the bags, which is further extended to explore the properties of nuclei. We estimate the meson-nucleus bound state energies by solving the Klein-Gordon equations with the real potentials calculated self-consistently within the model, using a coordinate space approach. The calculations are carried out for different nuclear interactions. The effects of Coulomb interaction are considered in the present study for the charged mesons. Our study indicates the formation of rather deeply bound $B$-mesic states at the very central region of the nuclei, compared to the $D$ and $K$ mesons, offering a more promising probe to explore subtle nuclear medium effects. The investigations of such bound states are of particular interest for the upcoming $\rm{\bar{P}ANDA}$ at FAIR, J-PARC-E29 and JLab experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigation of kaonic atom optical potential by the high precision data of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of complete fusion suppression for 6,7 Li nuclei using artificial neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the measurement of complete fusion cross-sections for various reactions, with particular emphasis on the reactions involving weakly bound projectile. It has been well established that the complete fusion cross-section involving weakly bound nuclei is suppressed at above barrier energies due to the breakup effect. Accurate determination of suppression factor is essential to understand the effect of breakup on complete fusion suppression. In this study, Feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods based on Multilayer Perceptron is utilized to estimate the complete fusion suppression factor for reactions involving 6,7 Li projectile from the comparison of ANN predicted reduced fusion functions (F (x)) with the Universal Fusion Function(F0 (x)). Average suppression factor has been estimated as 0.68 and 0.74 for 6 Li and 7 Li induced reactions respectively. Normalized Mean Squared Error(NMSE) has been calculated as 1.85% for training and 1.92% for testing data of ANN for 6 Li case, while for 7 Li cases, the same is for 3.73% and 6.48% respectively. Present results have been compared with three other alternative methods Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression and Gaussian Process Regression. Relevant performance matrices has been estimated. It has been observed that, ANN algorithm is giving the better accuracy as compared with other. This results indicate that ANN might be an alternative tool for estimation of complete fusion suppression factor for weakly bound projectile.</description>

      <title>Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Cold nuclear matter effects on azimuthal decorrelation in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assumption of factorization lies at the core of calculations of medium effects on observables computable in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. In this work we examine this assumption, for which we propose a setup to study hard processes and bulk nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions on the same footing using the Glauber modelling of heavy nuclei. To exemplify this approach, we calculate the leading-order corrections to azimuthal decorrelation in Drell-Yan and boson-jet processes due to cold nuclear matter effects, not considering radiation. At leading order in both the hard momentum scale and the nuclear size, the impact-parameter dependent cross section is found to factorize for both processes. The factorization formula involves a convolution of the hard cross section with the medium-modified parton distributions, and, for boson-jet production, the medium-modified jet function.</description>

      <title>Magicity versus superfluidity around $^{28}$O viewed from the study of $^{30}$F</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron-rich unbound fluorine isotope $^{30}$F$_{21}$ has been observed for the first time by measuring its neutron decay at the SAMURAI spectrometer (RIBF, RIKEN) in the quasi-free proton knockout reaction of $^{31}$Ne nuclei at 235 MeV/nucleon. The mass and thus one-neutron-separation energy of $^{30}$F has been determined to be $S_n = -472\pm 58 \mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 33 \mathrm{(sys.)}$ keV from the measurement of its invariant-mass spectrum. The absence of a sharp drop in $S_n$($^{30}$F) shows that the ``magic'' $N=20$ shell gap is not restored close to $^{28}$O, which is in agreement with our shell-model calculations that predict a near degeneracy between the neutron $d$ and $fp$ orbitals, with the $1p_{3/2}$ and $1p_{1/2}$ orbitals becoming more bound than the $0f_{7/2}$ one. This degeneracy and reordering of orbitals has two potential consequences: $^{28}$O behaves like a strongly superfluid nucleus with neutron pairs scattering across shells, and both $^{29,31}$F appear to be good two-neutron halo-nucleus candidates.</description>

      <title>Revisiting gauge invariance and Reggeization of pion exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Reggeized pion is expected to provide the main contribution to the forward cross section in light meson photoproduction reactions with charge exchange at high energies. We discuss the Reggeization of pion exchange in charged pion photoproduction with an emphasis on consistency with current conservation. We show that the gauge-invariant amplitude for the exchange of a particle with generic even spin $J\geq 2$ in the $t$-channel is analytic at $J=0$, and that it can be interpreted in terms of the nucleon electric current. This enables us to reconcile the dynamics in the $s$- and $u$-channel, which involves also nucleon exchanges, with the amplitude expressed in terms of $t$-channel partial waves, as required by Regge theory.</description>

      <title>Formulating Schwinger--Dyson equations for QED propagators in Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger--Dyson equations (SDEs) are coupled integral equations for the Green's functions of a quantum field theory (QFT). The SDE approach is the analytic nonperturbative method for solving strongly coupled QFTs. When applied to QCD, this approach, also based on the first principle, is the analytic alternative to lattice QCD. However, the SDEs for the n-point Green's functions involves (n+1)-point Green's functions (sometimes (n+2)-point functions as well). Therefore any practical method for solving this infinitely coupled system of equations requires a truncation scheme. When considering strongly coupled QED as a modeling of QCD, naive truncation schemes violate various principles of the gauge theory. These principles include gauge invariance, gauge covariance, and multiplicative renormalizability. The combination of dimensional regularization with the spectral representation of propagators results in a tractable formulation of a truncation scheme for the SDEs of QED propagators, which has the potential to preserve the aforementioned principles and renders solutions obtainable in the Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Study of one-step and two-step neutron transfer in the reaction $^{6}$Li + $^{9}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents the results of experiments on measuring the cross sections for elastic scattering and nucleon transfer channels in the $^{6}$Li + $^{9}$Be reaction at an incident energy of 68 MeV: $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{9}$Be, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be$_{2+}$, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be, $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Be)$^{8}$Li. The aim is to reveal the manifestation of the cluster structure of $^{9}$Be. Theoretical analysis of the contributions of one-step and two-step neutron transfer mechanisms is performed using the distorted wave Born approximation method with the Fresco code. Good agreement between the calculations and the experimental data was obtained for the channels of elastic scattering $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{9}$Be, neutron $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be and proton transfer $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Be)$^{8}$Li, as well as the transfer of two neutrons $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be. It is shown that the dineutron cluster transfer mechanism makes a dominant contribution to the $^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be reaction channel at forward angles.</description>

      <title>QCD jets in a hot and dense medium: a study of shower formation time and collision kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the use of MARTINI, a model which considers evolving QCD jets against a fluid dynamical background, it is shown that the introduction of formation time to the parton shower after the initial hard scattering is essential for a simultaneous description of charged hadron and jet $R_{AA}$. This inclusion also improves jet shape ratio at small angle and jet fragmentation function ratios of leading charged hadrons. The MARTINI framework is then aimed at a study of the leading order, next-to-leading-order, and non perturbative collision kernels. Sizable differences in the modification of jet substructure observables, i.e., jet shape and fragmentation functions are observed. Such differences are caused by the difference in the radiation rates of relatively soft gluons that survive in the evolution in medium.</description>

      <title>Likely existence of bound states and the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\psi$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground-breaking discovery of the first fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$ in the $J/\psi J/\psi$ invariant mass distribution by the LHCb collaboration has inspired intensive theoretical studies. Various interpretations, such as molecular states, compact tetraquark states, and coupled-channel effects, have been proposed for these states. Of particular interest is the ongoing search for the triple-$J/\psi$ state--a fully-charmed hexaquark state. To deepen our understanding of the triple-$J/\psi$ state and to guide future experimental searches, we study the triple-$J/\psi$ system in this work employing the Gaussian expansion method and the $J/\psi J/\psi$ potential parameterized to yield a shallow bound state, as suggested in several theoretical works. Our results support a triple-$J/\psi$ bound state, even in cases where the attractive interaction between the two $J/\psi$ mesons is very weak. Moreover, our analysis implies the Efimov effect in the triple-$J/\psi$ system. In addition, we extend our investigation to the triple-$\Upsilon (1S)$ system and obtain results similar to those for the triple-$J/\psi$ system.</description>

      <title>On the EFT of Dyon-Monopole Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monopole-fermion (and dyon-fermion) interactions provide a famous example where scattering from a compact object gives a cross section much larger than the object's geometrical size. This underlies the phenomenon of monopole catalysis of baryon-number violation because the reaction rate is much larger in the presence of a monopole than in its absence. It is sometimes claimed to violate the otherwise generic requirement that short distance physics decouples from long-distance observables -- a property that underpins the general utility of effective field theory (EFT) methods. Decoupling in this context is most simply expressed using point-particle effective field theories (PPEFTs) designed to capture systematically how small but massive objects influence their surroundings when probed only on length scales large compared to their size. These have been tested in precision calculations of how nuclear properties affect atomic energy levels for both ordinary and pionic atoms. We adapt the PPEFT formalism to describe low-energy $S$-wave dyon-fermion scattering with a view to understanding whether large catalysis cross sections violate decoupling (and show why they do not). We also explore the related but separate issue of the long-distance complications associated with polarizing the fermion vacuum exterior to a dyon and show in some circumstances how PPEFT methods can simplify calculations of low-energy fermion-dyon scattering in their presence. We propose an effective Hamiltonian governing how dyon excitations respond to fermion scattering in terms of a time-dependent vacuum angle and outline open questions remaining in its microscopic derivation.</description>

Abstract: We model the structure of hadrons by a confined parton gas with light-front kinematics. These partons are treated as classical spin-zero particles confined inside the hadron with inter-parton collisions as their only interaction. The microcanonical dynamics ensemble is applied to obtain the phase-space distribution of this thermodynamic system. We sample this phase-space distribution using Monte Carlo algorithms to obtain the parton distribution functions in scenarios with $3$, $4$, and $5$ partons.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Triaxial Shapes in Atomic Nuclei and a Quantum Theory of Rotation of Composite Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11299v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the traditional view, heavy deformed nuclei are like axially-symmetric prolate ellipsoids, rotating about one of the short axes. In the present picture, their shapes may be triaxial. The triaxial shape yields complex rotations, which actually well reproduce experimental data, as confirmed by state-of-the-art Configuration Interaction calculations. Two origins are suggested for the triaxiality: (i) binding-energy gain by the symmetry restoration for triaxial shapes, and (ii) another gain by specific components of the nuclear force, like tensor force and high-multipole (e.g. hexadecupole) central force. While the origin (i) produces basic modest triaxiality for virtually all deformed nuclei, the origin (ii) produces more prominent triaxiality for a certain class of nuclei. An example of the former is 154Sm, a typical showcase of axial symmetry but is now suggested to depict a modest yet finite triaxiality. The latter, prominent triaxiality, is discussed from various viewpoints for some exemplified nuclei including 166Er, and experimental findings. Many-body structures of the gamma band and the double-gamma band are clarified. Regarding the general features of rotational states of deformed many-body systems including triaxial ones, the well-known J(J+1) rule of rotational excitation energies is derived, within the quantum mechanical many-body theory, without resorting to the quantization of a rotating classical rigid body. This derivation is extended to finite K. The present picture of the rotation is robust and can be applied to various shapes or configurations, including clusters and molecules. Thus, two long-standing open problems, (i) occurrence and origins of triaxiality and (ii) quantum many-body derivation of rotational energy, are resolved. Their possible relations to Davydov's rigid-triaxial-rotor model are mentioned.</description>

      <title>Why is ${\rm Pb}^{208}$ the heaviest stable nuclide?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13082v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to understand nuclei in terms of quarks we develop an effective theory to low-energy quantum chromodynamics in which a single quark contained in a nucleus is driven by a mean field due to other constituents of the nucleus. We analyze the reason why the number of $d$ quarks in light stable nuclei is much the same as that of $u$ quarks, while for heavier nuclei beginning with ${\rm Ca}^{40}$, the number of $d$ quarks is greater than the number of $u$ quarks. To account for the finiteness of the periodic table, we invoke a version of gauge/gravity duality between the dynamical affair in stable nuclei and that in extremal black holes. With the assumption that the end of stability for heavy nuclei is dual to the occurrence of a naked singularity, we find that the maximal number of protons in stable nuclei is $Z_{\max}^{\rm H}\approx 82$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical method to calculate the stellar $\beta$-decay rates of nuclei in stellar environments with high temperature and density, based on the projected shell model, where contributions from both allowed and first-forbidden transitions are taken into account. As the first example, the stellar $\beta$-decay rate of one of the last $s$-process branching-point nuclei, $^{204}$Tl, is calculated and studied, where all related transitions are first-forbidden transitions. For the terrestrial case, the ground-state to ground-state transition is unique first-forbidden transition, which is described reasonably by our calculations. At the typical $s$-process temperature ($T\approx 0.3$ GK), non-unique first-forbidden transitions from thermally populated excited states of the parent nucleus are involved, the effective rate from our calculations is much lower than the one from the widely used data tables by Takahashi and Yokoi. Effect of the quenching factors for nuclear matrix elements in first-forbidden transitions on the stellar $\beta$-decay rates is discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the static density and spin structure factors in the long wavelength limit for pure neutron matter at subsaturation densities relevant to core-collapse supernovae within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) approach. The BHF results are reliable at high densities, extending beyond the validity of the virial expansion. Motivated by the similarities between the dilute neutron gas and a unitary gas, we propose a phenomenological approach to derive the static structures with finite momentum transfer as well as the dynamic ones with simple analytical expressions, based on the computed static structures in the long wavelength limit. We also compare the in-medium neutrino-neutron scattering cross sections using different structure factors. Our study emphasizes the importance of accurately computing the static structure factors theoretically and utilizing the full dynamic structure factors in core-collapse supernova simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to solve for the pseudoscalar bound state amplitude of a fermion and an antifermion from its Bethe--Salpeter equation (BSE) in the Minkowski space applying spectral representations. With the dressing of the fermion propagators specified by their spectral functions, we first derive the explicit expressions for the Nakanishi spectral functions of the Bethe--Salpeter wave function (BSWF) in terms of these propagators and the Bethe--Salpeter amplitude (BSA) directly from the definition in the momentum space. Applying the rainbow-ladder truncation in the covariant gauge, we then convert the BSE in the momentum space into identities that calculate the spectral functions of the BSA from those of the gauge-boson propagator and of the BSWF. These relations form a closed set of linear functionals for the Nakanishi spectral functions with analytical kernels, laying the foundation for the numerical solution of the BSE in the Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>The stochastic relativistic advection diffusion equation from the Metropolis algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an approach to simulating the stochastic relativistic advection-diffusion equation based on the Metropolis algorithm. We show that the dissipative dynamics of the boosted fluctuating fluid can be simulated by making random transfers of charge between fluid cells, interspersed with ideal hydrodynamic time steps. The random charge transfers are accepted or rejected in a Metropolis step using the entropy as a statistical weight. This procedure reproduces the expected strains of dissipative relativistic hydrodynamics in a specific (and non-covariant) hydrodynamic frame known as the density frame. Numerical results, both with and without noise, are presented and compared to relativistic kinetics and analytical expectations. An all order resummation of the density frame gradient expansion reproduces the covariant dynamics in a specific model. In contrast to all other numerical approaches to relativistic dissipative fluids, the dissipative fluid formalism presented here is strictly first order in gradients and has no non-hydrodynamic modes. The physical naturalness and simplicity of the Metropolis algorithm, together with its convergence properties, make it a promising tool for simulating stochastic relativistic fluids in heavy ion collisions and for critical phenomena in the relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Inter-band B(E1) Strengths in Heavy Nuclei based on the Proxy-SU(3) Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational bands of positive and negative parity are frequently found experimentally in heavy deformed even-even nuclei along with their corresponding $E2$ intra-band and $E1$ inter-band transitions. In $SU(3)$ symmetry-based models, calculating the $B(E2)$ strengths is relatively straightforward due to the relation between the $E2$ operator and the quadrupole generator of the algebra. However, calculating the $B(E1)$ strengths is a more difficult task, requiring computations involving the shell-model expansion of the dipole operator and multi-shell matrix elements. In this work the $E1$ operator is expanded in $SU(3)$ second quantization and applied to calculate the inter-band $B(E1)$ strengths of the isotope $^{224}$Th using the semi-microscopic algebraic quartet model (SAQM) based on the recently proposed proxy-$SU(3)$ scheme.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres favors the stability of neutron-rich atomic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In spite of the success of the Bethe-Weizs\"acker mass formula in its modern numerical and predictive implementations, the common-knowledge principle that it is electrostatics which, ultimately, favors neutron-rich nuclei still presents unclear aspects. For example, while it is true that the Coulomb interaction promotes the tendency towards neutron-rich nuclei, the opposite effects of Majorana exchange forces and Pauli exclusion are known to counteract this tendency. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides a missing contribution to the theoretical description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory predicts, on purely geometric grounds, that the most stable nuclei are those with ratio $Z/N \approx 0.75$. This new "geometric" random-packing contribution to the semi-empirical mass formula may be the missing aspect of nuclear structure that tilts the balance towards neutron-rich nuclei in the Segr\`e stability chart.</description>

      <title>Shear Viscosity of Asymptotically Hot and Dense QCD Matter: AMY Formalism vs. A Modified Relaxation Time Approximation in 0-flavor SU(3) Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AMY formalism is widely used to describe the transport coefficients of asymptotically hot and dense QCD matter, such as shear viscosity $\eta$. In literature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was expressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation. Recent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical expressions for $\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and densities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the quark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these studies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with added (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison was the "modified" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison between the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log expression) and the modified RTA expression for $\eta$ is made in 0-flavor SU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the modified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated with collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the Chapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic collider-produced QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) are important quantities in describing nucleon structures. They are universal and process-independent. As a matter of fact, nucleon PDFs are inevitably affected by nuclear matter during nuclear scattering process. In order to study the nuclear PDFs (nPDFs), in this paper, we introduce the nucleon pair PDFs (dPDFs) to describe parton distributions in the nucleon pair which is confined to a nucleus. We first of all construct the nuclear state in terms of nucleonic Fock states and calculate the operator definition of nPDFs. Neglecting the higher order corrections or nucleon correlations, we find that nPDFs can be written as a sum of two terms which respectively correspond to PDFs and dPDFs. Nucleon pair PDFs which stem from nucleon-nucleon correlation are proportional to common nucleon PDFs but suppressed by a factor. It is naturally to obtain the slope of the EMC effect $dR_{EMC}/dx$ as long as the factor is independent of momentum fraction $x$. We further calculate the Paschos-Wolfenstein ratio to study the nuclear matter effect on the extraction of weak mixing angle or $\sin^2\theta_W$ by using dPDFs.</description>

      <title>Probing coalescence of light nuclei via femtoscopy and azimuthal anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production mechanism of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions is vital to understanding the intricate details of nucleon-nucleon interactions. The coalescence of nucleons is a well-known mechanism that attempts to explain the production mechanism of these light clusters. This work investigates the formation mechanism of these nucleon clusters with a combination of coalescence and femtoscopy of nucleons and nuclei. It is achieved by appending a coalescence and correlation afterburner (\texttt{CRAB}) to the \texttt{SMASH} transport model. To have a proper view of the anisotropy of light nuclei clusters, a mean-field approach to \texttt{SMASH} is applied. The anisotropic coefficients of various light nuclei clusters are calculated and compared to experimental measurements. To incorporate hydrodynamics into the picture, the anisotropic measurements are completed in a hybrid \texttt{SMASH}+\texttt{vHLLE} mode. In both approaches, the femtoscopy of nucleons and light nuclei is performed, reported with CRAB, and compared to the latest experimental measurements. An insight into cluster formation time is drawn by extracting the emission source size with the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits (LL) model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization group flows of the $SU(N_f)\times SU(N_f)$ symmetric Ginzburg-Landau potential are calculated for a general number of flavors, $N_f$. Our approach does not rely on the $\epsilon$ expansion, but uses the functional renormalization group, formulated directly in $d=3$ spatial dimensions, with the inclusion of all possible (perturbatively) relevant and marginal operators, whose number is considerably larger than those in $d=4$. We find new, potentially infrared stable fixed points spanned throughout the entire $N_f$ range. By conjecturing that the thermal chiral transition is governed by these ``flavor continuous" fixed points, stability analyses show that for $N_f\geq 5$ the chiral transition is of second-order, while for $N_f=2,3,4$, it is of first-order. We argue that the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ anomaly controls the strength of the first-order chiral transition for $N_f=2,3,4$, and makes it almost indistinguishable from a second-order one, if it is sufficiently weak at the critical point. This could open up a new strategy to investigate the strength of the $U_{\rm A}(1)$ symmetry breaking around the critical temperature.</description>

Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon cross sections are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated. The absence of $\Delta$ broadening is slightly favored, but the larger uncertainties on the pion production data prevent definitive conclusions.</description>

Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that this ambiguity can be solved in interacting field theories. We prove that the mean field limit of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions is equivalent to non-dissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor.</description>

      <title>Net-proton fluctuations influenced by baryon stopping and quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preliminary data from the Beam-Energy Scan II measurements by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider suggest a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when plotted vs. beam energy. At the same energy range where the structure appears, a transition from hadrons to quarks is expected, the deconfinement transition. In this paper, the role of quark deconfinement in establishing fluctuaitions in the early stages of the collision is considered. Two models are compared: one with stopping occurring on a baryon-by-baryon basis, and a second where stopping proceeds through quark degrees of freedom. In the latter model, the fluctuation of baryon number is significantly reduced and this signal is found to survive recombination into hadrons and the subsequent diffusion. The transformation from baryon to quark stopping thus produces a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when plotted vs. beam energy, consistent with observations.</description>
