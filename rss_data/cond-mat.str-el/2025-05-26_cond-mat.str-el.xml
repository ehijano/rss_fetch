      <title>Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>Condensate Fraction Scaling and Specific Heat Anomaly around Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition of Superconductivity and Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the superconducting and superfluid transitions in two-dimensional (2D) many-body systems is of broad interest and remains a fundamental issue. In this study, we establish the {\it condensate fraction} as a highly effective tool to achieve that and accordingly propose efficient schemes for accurately determining the transitions, via numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using the 2D attractive Fermi-Hubbard model as a testbed, we access unprecedented system sizes (up to 4096 lattice sites) and perform a comprehensive analysis for the temperature dependence and finite-size scaling of {\it condensate fraction} across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. We demonstrate that this quantity exhibits algebraic scaling below the transition and exponential scaling above it, with significantly smaller finite-size effect comparing to the extensively studied on-site pairing correlator. This greatly improves the determination of BKT transition with moderate system sizes. We also extract the finite-size BKT transition temperature from condensate fraction, and confirm its logarithmic correction on system size. Furthermore, we find that the specific heat displays an anomaly, showing a peak at a temperature slightly above BKT transition. Our findings should be generally applicable to 2D fermionic and bosonic systems hosting superconductivity or superfluidity.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking and thermal phase transition of the spin-1 quantum magnet with SU(3) symmetry on the simple cubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a combined analysis from Poisson-Dirichlet and symmetry-breaking calculations as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the ordered phase and the thermal phase transition of the three-dimensional spin-1 quantum magnet on the simple cubic lattice with bilinear and biquadratic interactions and SU(3) internal symmetry. We obtain exact results for the order parameter distribution function that compare well to the quantum Monte Carlo data. Furthermore, based on a detailed finite-size analysis, we provide evidence that the thermal melting transition at the SU(3) point is either weakly first-order in this system or, if continuous, it falls beyond the unitary-bounds of conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Light-Driven Bound State of Interacting Impurities in a Dirac-Like Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations have revealed the presence of exceptional points in the low-energy effective spin-interacting impurity model, previously explored via non-Hermitian renormalization group (RG) techniques. These studies uncovered novel RG fixed points and linked them to distinct transport signatures. In this work, we revisit the model from a real-time field-theoretic perspective, studying both non-interacting and strongly correlated ($U = \infty$) limits using the exact equation of motion and a Large-$N$ Keldysh variational mean-field approach. Remarkably, we find that the steady-state solutions of the Keldysh action exhibit the same fixed point structure as the RG flows, independently recovering the exceptional behavior. Our analysis further reveals that exceptional points (EPs) arise naturally in the Green's function structure without any ad hoc non-Hermitian terms and are associated with self-consistent light-induced hybridization in specific regimes. Importantly, we identify a new causal steady state in which the appearance of EPs is not inherently tied to causality violation; instead, a sign-reversing (negative) flip hybridization contribution restores causality. These findings suggest a broader framework in which EPs coexist with well-defined dynamical behavior and open the door to controlled light-driven engineering of dissipative quantum impurity states.</description>

      <title>Pressure tuning of competing interactions on a honeycomb lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic exchange interactions are mediated via orbital overlaps across chemical bonds. Thus, modifying the bond angles by physical pressure or strain can tune the relative strength of competing interactions. Here we present a remarkable case of such tuning between the Heisenberg (J) and Kitaev (K) exchange, which respectively establish magnetically ordered and spin liquid phases on a honeycomb lattice. We observe a rapid suppression of the Neel temperature (TN) with pressure in Ag3LiRh2O6, a spin-1/2 honeycomb lattice with both J and K couplings. Using a combined analysis of x-ray data and first-principles calculations, we find that pressure modifies the bond angles in a way that increases the |K/J| ratio and thereby suppresses TN. Consistent with this picture, we observe a spontaneous onset of muon spin relaxation (muSR) oscillations below TN at low pressure, whereas in the high-pressure phase, oscillations appear only when T &lt; TN/2. Unlike other candidate Kitaev materials, Ag3LiRh2O6 is tuned toward a quantum critical point by pressure while avoiding a structural dimerization in the relevant pressure range.</description>

      <title>Dilute Paramagnetism and Non-Trivial Topology in Quasicrystal Approximant Fe$_4$Al$_{13}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A very fundamental property of both weakly and strongly interacting materials is the nature of its magnetic response. In this work we detail the growth of crystals of the quasicrystal approximant Fe$_4$Al$_{13}$ with an Al flux solvent method. We characterize our samples using electrical transport and heat capacity, yielding results consistent with a simple non-magnetic metal. However, magnetization measurements portray an extremely unusual response for a dilute paramagnet and do not exhibit the characteristic Curie-Weiss behavior expected for a weakly interacting material at high temperature. Electronic structure calculations confirm metallic behavior, but also indicate that each isolated band near the Fermi energy hosts non-trivial topologies including strong, weak and nodal components, with resultant topological surface states distinguishable from bulk states on the (001) surface. With half-filled flat bands apparent in the calculation but absence of long-range magnetic order, the unusual paramagnetic response suggests the dilute paramagnetic behavior in this quasicrystal approximant is surprising and may serve as a test of the fundamental assumptions that are taken for granted for the magnetic response of weakly interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Explaining the extra crystal field mode in ACeX2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing list of Ce-based magnets have shown an extra and heretofore unexplained crystal electric field (CEF) mode at high energies. We describe a process whereby an optical phonon can produce a split CEF mode well above the phonon energy. We use density functional theory and point-charge model calculations to estimate the phonon distortions and coupling to model this effect in KCeO$_2$, showing that it accounts for the extra CEF mode observed. This mechanism is generic, and may explain the extra modes observed on a variety of Ce$^{3+}$ compounds.</description>

      <title>Higher-order topological phases protected by non-invertible and subsystem symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases with invertible symmetries have been extensively studied in recent years, revealing gapless modes localized on boundaries of higher codimension. In this work, we extend the framework of higher-order symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases to include non-invertible symmetries. We construct a concrete model of a second-order SPT phase in $2+1$ dimensions that hosts symmetry-protected corner modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry. This construction is then generalized to a $d^{th}$-order SPT phase in $d+1$ dimensions, featuring similarly protected corner modes. Additionally, we demonstrate a second-order SPT phase in $3+1$ dimensions exhibiting hinge modes protected by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multiparty entanglement loops in quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) give rise to exotic emergent particles by weaving intricate entanglement patterns in the underlying electrons. Bipartite measures between subregions can detect the presence of anyons, but little is known about the full entanglement structure of QSLs. Here, we study the multiparty entanglement of QSLs via entanglement microscopy. We find that in contrast to conventional matter, the genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) between spins is absent in the smallest subregions, a phenomenon we call "entanglement frustration". Instead, GME is more collective, and arises solely in loops. By exploiting exact results and large-scale numerics, we confirm these properties in various gapped and gapless QSLs realised in physically motivated Hamiltonians, as well as with string-net wavefunctions hosting abelian or non-abelian anyons. Our results shed new light on the phase diagram of Kitaev's honeycomb model in a Zeeman field, and the Kagome Heisenberg model under various perturbations. Going beyond QSLs, we provide evidence that entanglement loops are a universal property of quantum gauge theories. This leads to a new understanding of fractionalization, and the means by which gauge bosons encode quantum information.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization, shadowing breakdown, and the absence of Trotterization transition in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of premier utilities of present day noisy quantum computers is simulation of many-body quantum systems. We study how long in time is such a discrete-time simulation representative of a continuous time Hamiltonian evolution, namely, a finite time-step introduces so-called Trotterization errors. We show that the truncated operator propagator (Ruelle-Pollicott resonances) is a powerful tool to that end, as well as to study prethermalization and discrete time crystals, including finding those phenomena at large gate duration, and can be used to calculate diffusion constant. We show that the effective energy is more stable than suggested by Trotter errors -- a manifestation of prethermalization -- while all other observables are not. Even such the most stable observable though deteriorates in the thermodynamic limit. Different than in classical systems with the strongest chaos, where the faithfulness time (the shadowing time) can be infinite, in quantum many-body chaotic systems it is finite. A corollary of our results is also that, opposite to previous claims, there is no Trotterization transition in non-integrable many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effect without global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect, where a system initially farther from equilibrium relaxes faster than one closer to equilibrium, has been extensively studied in classical systems and recently explored in quantum settings. While previous studies of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) have largely focused on isolated systems with global symmetries, we argue that the QME is ubiquitous in generic, non-integrable many-body systems lacking such symmetries, including U(1) charge conservation, spatial symmetries, and even energy conservation. Using paradigmatic models such as the quantum Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields, we show that the QME can be understood through the energy density of initial states and their inverse participation ratio in the energy eigenbasis. Our findings provide a unified framework for the QME, linking it with classical thermal relaxation and phenomena such as prethermalization and weak ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Resolving Intervalley Gaps and Many-Body Resonances in Moir\'e Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted multilayer graphene stands out as a highly tunable class of moir\'e materials that exhibit strong electronic correlations and robust superconductivity. However, understanding the relations between the low-temperature superconducting phase and the preceding correlated phases established at higher temperatures remains a challenge. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to track the formation sequence of correlated phases established by the interplay of dynamic correlations, intervalley coherence, and superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG). We discover the existence of two well-resolved gaps pinned at the Fermi level within the superconducting doping range. While the outer gap, previously associated with pseudogap phase, persists at high temperatures and magnetic fields, the newly revealed inner gap is more fragile in line with superconductivity MATTG transport experiments. Andreev reflection spectroscopy taken at the same location confirms a clear trend that closely follows the doping behaviour of the inner gap, and not the outer one. Moreover, spectroscopy taken at nanoscale domain boundaries further corroborates the contrasting behavior of the two gaps, with the inner gap remaining resilient to structural variations, as expected from the finite superconducting coherence length. By comparing our findings with recent topological heavy-fermion models, we identify that the outer gap originates from the splitting of the Abrikosov-Suhl-Kondo resonance due to the breaking of the valley symmetry arising from correlation-driven effects. Our results suggest an intricate but tractable hierarchy of correlated phases in twisted multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Superinsulating behavior in granular Pb film on gated few-layer MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a super-insulating behavior, in a device having granular Pb film on back-gated few-layer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$, below an onset temperature same as the critical temperature $T_{\rm C}\approx7$ K of bulk Pb. Below $T_{\rm C}$, the current-voltage characteristics exhibit a threshold voltage marking a crossover between the low-bias insulating and the high-bias normal-resistance states, consistent with the known super-insulating state behavior. A temperature dependent critical magnetic field is also found above which the insulating behavior is suppressed. The threshold voltage is found to vary with the gate-voltage but the critical field remains unchanged. With reducing temperature, the sample conductance saturates to a finite value, which depends on magnetic field and gate-voltage. This saturation behavior is found to be inconsistent with the charge-BKT and the thermal activation models but it can be fitted well to a combination of thermal activation and quantum fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: In the context of energy storage at the nanoscale, exploring the notion of \textit{quantum advantage} implies walking on the thin line at the boundary between quantum mechanics and thermodynamics, which underpins our conventional understanding of battery devices. With no classical analogue, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has emerged in the last years as a promising platform to boost charging and storage efficiency thanks to its highly-entangling dynamics. Here, we explore how the robustness of this setup by considering the sparse version of the SYK model, showing that, as long as chaos is not completely broken, reducing its complexity may lead to more efficient quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Polarization Vortices in a Ferromagnetic Metal via Twistronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in moire engineering provide new pathways for manipulating lattice distortions and electronic properties in low-dimensional materials. Here, we demonstrate that twisted stacking can induce dipolar vortices in metallic SrRuO3 membranes, despite the presence of free charges that would normally screen depolarizing fields and dipole-dipole interactions. These polarization vortices are correlated with moire-periodic flexoelectricity induced by shear strain gradients, and exhibit a pronounced dependence on the twist angle. In addition, multiferroic behavior emerges below the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of the films, whereby polarization and ferromagnetism coexist and compete, showing opposite twist-angle dependencies of their respective magnitudes. Density functional theory calculations provide insights into the microscopic origin of these observations. Our findings extend the scope of polarization topology design beyond dielectric materials and into metals.</description>

      <title>Tunability of the magnetic properties in Ni intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ni$_{0.33}$NbSe$_2$ has been identified as an altermagnet with a Neel temperature of 84 K, although Ni$_{0.21}$NbSe$_2$ behaves like a nonmagnetic metal. In this work, we explore the magnetic phases of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ with stoichiometry Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, which lies between the two previously studied compositions. Our results reveal a transition in the ground state from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase (above UC).In the Kramers antiferromagnetic state, the nearest-neighbour magnetic coupling is ferromagnetic between the layers and forms stripe-like patterns in the ab plane. This behavior contrasts with that of Ni$_{0.33}$NbSe$_2$ where the nearest-neighbour magnetic couplings are opposite, and the magnetic easy axis aligns along the z-axis. The strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the second-nearest neighbor coupling stabilize the Kramers antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases with spins aligned along the z-axis over the non-collinear 120 phase with in-plane spin orientations. Given the triangular lattice and the closeness to both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling, a metamagnetic transition is possible. Substantial modifications to the electronic structure accompany Ni intercalation in NbSe$_2$ with respect to the pristine phase. Compared to pristine NbSe$_2$, which features a hole pocket at the $\Gamma$ point, the stripe phase of Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$ instead exhibits an electron pocket at $\Gamma$. This pocket at $\Gamma$ has predominantly 3z$^2$-r$^2$ character, and derives its main spectral weight from the Nb atoms. Ni intercalation also shifts the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential electronic instabilities.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects in two-dimensional electron systems at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liouvillian skin effects, manifested as the localization of Liouvillian eigenstates around the boundary, are distinctive features of non-Hermitian systems and are particularly notable for their impact on system dynamics. Despite their significance, Liouvillian skin effects have not been sufficiently explored in electron systems. In this work, we demonstrate that a two-dimensional electron system on a substrate exhibits $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Liouvillian skin effects due to the interplay among energy dissipations, spin-orbit coupling, and a transverse magnetic field. In addition, our analysis of the temperature dependence reveals that these Liouvillian skin effects become pronounced below the energy scale of band splitting induced by the spin-orbit coupling and the magnetic field. While our Liouvillian skin effect leads to charge accumulation under quench dynamics, its relaxation time is independent of the system size, in contrast to that of previously reported Liouvillian skin effects. This difference is attributed to the scale-free behavior of the localization length, which is analogous to non-Hermitian critical skin effects.</description>

      <title>Pseudomode expansion of many-body correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an expansion of a many-body correlation function in a sum of pseudomodes -- exponents with complex frequencies that encompass both decay and oscillations. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we present pseudomode expansions of infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice. It turns out that it is enough to take a few first pseudomodes to obtain a good approximation to the correlation function.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>

Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Disclinations, dislocations, and emanant flux at Dirac criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What happens when fermions hop on a lattice with crystalline defects? The answer depends on topological quantum numbers which specify the action of lattice rotations and translations in the low energy theory. One can understand the topological quantum numbers as a twist of continuum gauge fields in terms of crystalline gauge fields. We find that disclinations and dislocations -- defects of crystalline symmetries -- generally lead in the continuum to a certain ``emanant'' quantized magnetic flux. To demonstrate these facts, we study in detail tight-binding models whose low-energy descriptions are (2+1)D Dirac cones. Our map from lattice to continuum defects explains the crystalline topological response to disclinations and dislocations, and motivates the fermion crystalline equivalence principle used in the classification of crystalline topological phases. When the gap closes, the presence of emanant flux leads to pair creation from the vacuum with the particles and anti-particles swirling around the defect. We compute the associated currents and energy density using the tools of defect conformal field theory. There is a rich set of renormalization group fixed points, depending on how particles scatter from the defect. At half flux, there is a defect conformal manifold leading to a continuum of possible low-energy theories. We present extensive numerical evidence supporting the emanant magnetic flux at lattice defects and we test our map between lattice and continuum defects in detail. We also point out a no-go result, which implies that a single (2+1)D Dirac cone in symmetry class AII is incompatible with a commuting $C_M$ rotational symmetry with $(C_M)^M = +1$.</description>

      <title>Probing dielectric breakdown in Mott insulators through current oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric breakdown of mesoscopic Mott insulators, a phenomenon where a strong electric field destabilizes the insulating state, resulting in a transition to a metallic phase. Using the Landau-Zener formalism, which models the excitation of a two-level system, we derive a theoretical expression for the threshold value of the field. To validate our predictions, we present an efficient protocol for estimating the charge gap and threshold field via non-equilibrium current oscillations, overcoming the computational limitations of exact diagonalization. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical formula for systems with small gaps. Moreover, our findings are directly testable in ultracold atomic experiments with ring geometries and artificial gauge fields, as our method uses measurable quantities and relies on already available technologies. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimentally realizable protocols, providing tools to explore non-equilibrium mesoscopic phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Generic (fractional) quantum anomalous Hall crystals from interaction-driven band folding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental realizations of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states have been achieved recently, and there is a growing number of experiments in moir\'e systems showing the inequality between the filling of the Chern band and the quantized Hall conductance: $\nu\neq\sigma_\mathrm{H}$. Among many possible explanations, a popular one is that the topological states have coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders, and such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, apart from the experimental uncertainties, the generic mechanism of Hall crystals, especially those with fractional $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is still elusive at the microscopic level. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model and find that, the Chern band can be folded by the interaction-driven CDW, and a mini Chern band appears above the CDW gap. Through further analysis, we find the energy dispersion and the fluctuation of quantum geometry of the miniband could be flattened by competing interactions. When further doping this miniband, a series of (F)QAH states are found to coexist with the CDW order at (fractional)integer fillings of the miniband and the Hall conductivities of the FQAH crystals (FQAHCs)- determined by the fillings of the miniband - are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find the separation of energy scales and a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures. Our work paves the way for the systematic understanding of (fractional) Hall crystals.</description>

      <title>Metal-Insulator Transition described by Natural Orbital Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metal-insulator transition (MIT) is a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics and a hallmark of strong electronic correlations. Hydrogen-based systems offer a simple yet powerful model for investigating the MIT, as their insulating behavior arises purely from electron-electron interactions. In this work, we study finite hydrogen clusters with cubic geometries using Natural Orbital Functional Theory (NOFT), a method capable of accurately describing correlated systems beyond mean-field approaches. We focus on two key signatures of the MIT: the fundamental energy gap and the harmonic average of the atomic one-particle reduced density matrix. Our results show that NOFT captures the transition from insulating to metallic behavior as the interatomic distance decreases. By extrapolating the energy gap to the thermodynamic limit, we estimate a critical distance rc ~ 1.2 Ang, in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo benchmarks. These findings demonstrate the reliability of NOFT for describing strong correlation effects in large-scale models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a Krylov-subspace time evolution algorithm, we simulate the real-time dynamics of translation invariant non-integrable finite spin rings to quite long times with high accuracy. We systematically study the finite-size deviation between the resulting equilibrium state and the thermal state, and we highlight the importance of the energy variance on the deviations. We find that the deviations are well described by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and that the von Neumann entropy correction scaling is the square of the local operator scaling. We reveal also an area law contribution to the relaxed von Neumann entropy, which we connect to the mutual information between the considered subsystem and its immediate environment. We also find that local observables relax towards equilibrium exponentially with a relaxation time scale that grows linearly with system length and is somewhat independent of the local operator, but depends strongly on the energy of the initial state, with the fastest relaxation times found towards one end of the overall energy spectrum. To contrast this behaviour we also study domain wall initial states, which exhibit clear diffusive behaviour, with a Thouless time scaling quadratically with the systems size, leading to a rather precise estimate for the diffusion constant for states in the vicinity of the middle of the energy spectrum.</description>

Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.</description>
