      <title>Personhood credentials: Artificial intelligence and the value of privacy-preserving tools to distinguish who is real online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anonymity is an important principle online. However, malicious actors have long used misleading identities to conduct fraud, spread disinformation, and carry out other deceptive schemes. With the advent of increasingly capable AI, bad actors can amplify the potential scale and effectiveness of their operations, intensifying the challenge of balancing anonymity and trustworthiness online. In this paper, we analyze the value of a new tool to address this challenge: "personhood credentials" (PHCs), digital credentials that empower users to demonstrate that they are real people -- not AIs -- to online services, without disclosing any personal information. Such credentials can be issued by a range of trusted institutions -- governments or otherwise. A PHC system, according to our definition, could be local or global, and does not need to be biometrics-based. Two trends in AI contribute to the urgency of the challenge: AI's increasing indistinguishability (i.e., lifelike content and avatars, agentic activity) from people online, and AI's increasing scalability (i.e., cost-effectiveness, accessibility). Drawing on a long history of research into anonymous credentials and "proof-of-personhood" systems, personhood credentials give people a way to signal their trustworthiness on online platforms, and offer service providers new tools for reducing misuse by bad actors. In contrast, existing countermeasures to automated deception -- such as CAPTCHAs -- are inadequate against sophisticated AI, while stringent identity verification solutions are insufficiently private for many use-cases. After surveying the benefits of personhood credentials, we also examine deployment risks and design challenges. We conclude with actionable next steps for policymakers, technologists, and standards bodies to consider in consultation with the public.</description>

      <title>The doctor will polygraph you now: ethical concerns with AI for fact-checking patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been proposed for predicting social behaviors which could be reasonably understood from patient-reported data. This raises ethical concerns about respect, privacy, and patient awareness/control over how their health data is used. Ethical concerns surrounding clinical AI systems for social behavior verification were divided into three main categories: (1) the use of patient data retrospectively without informed consent for the specific task of verification, (2) the potential for inaccuracies or biases within such systems, and (3) the impact on trust in patient-provider relationships with the introduction of automated AI systems for fact-checking. Additionally, this report showed the simulated misuse of a verification system and identified a potential LLM bias against patient-reported information in favor of multimodal data, published literature, and the outputs of other AI methods (i.e., AI self-trust). Finally, recommendations were presented for mitigating the risk that AI verification systems will cause harm to patients or undermine the purpose of the healthcare system.</description>

      <title>When and Why is Persuasion Hard? A Computational Complexity Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative foundation models improve, they also tend to become more persuasive, raising concerns that AI automation will enable governments, firms, and other actors to manipulate beliefs with unprecedented scale and effectiveness at virtually no cost. The full economic and social ramifications of this trend have been difficult to foresee, however, given that we currently lack a complete theoretical understanding of why persuasion is costly for human labor to produce in the first place. This paper places human and AI agents on a common conceptual footing by formalizing informational persuasion as a mathematical decision problem and characterizing its computational complexity. A novel proof establishes that persuasive messages are challenging to discover (NP-Hard) but easy to adopt if supplied by others (NP). This asymmetry helps explain why people are susceptible to persuasion, even in contexts where all relevant information is publicly available. The result also illuminates why litigation, strategic communication, and other persuasion-oriented activities have historically been so human capital intensive, and it provides a new theoretical basis for studying how AI will impact various industries.</description>

      <title>Adapting cybersecurity frameworks to manage frontier AI risks: A defense-in-depth approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex and evolving threat landscape of frontier AI development requires a multi-layered approach to risk management ("defense-in-depth"). By reviewing cybersecurity and AI frameworks, we outline three approaches that can help identify gaps in the management of AI-related risks. First, a functional approach identifies essential categories of activities ("functions") that a risk management approach should cover, as in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). Second, a lifecycle approach instead assigns safety and security activities across the model development lifecycle, as in DevSecOps and the OECD AI lifecycle framework. Third, a threat-based approach identifies tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious actors, as in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK and MITRE ATLAS databases. We recommend that frontier AI developers and policymakers begin by adopting the functional approach, given the existence of the NIST AI RMF and other supplementary guides, but also establish a detailed frontier AI lifecycle model and threat-based TTP databases for future use.</description>

      <title>US-Singapore cooperation on tech and security: defense, cyber, and biotech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partnership between the United States and Singapore is founded in no small part on the shared recognition of the value that technology has for national security. Over the last 55 years, Singapore has become an established purchaser of U.S. defense technology, but the past 20 years have also seen the U.S.-Singapore relationship mature into an increasingly collaborative one, tackling newer fields like cybersecurity and biosecurity. However, current geopolitical tensions present a challenge for Singapore, which strives to retain its strategic autonomy by maintaining positive relations with all parties. Paradoxically, the rise of non-traditional security threats may pave the way for greater bilateral cooperation by allowing Singapore to position itself as a hub for cooperation on regional security issues in Southeast Asia at large. In such spirit, this paper recommends that the United States and Singapore do the following: 1) in defense technology, co-develop niche capabilities in C4ISR and unmanned systems with peacetime applications; 2) in cybersecurity, improve their domestic resilience against sophisticated nation-state actors while also building regional capacity to counter cybercrime in Southeast Asia; and 3) in biosecurity, strengthen regional epidemiological surveillance to brace against possible future pandemics.</description>

      <title>Decoding Memes: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models for Template Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-with-text memes combine text with imagery to achieve comedy, but in today's world, they also play a pivotal role in online communication, influencing politics, marketing, and social norms. A "meme template" is a preexisting layout or format that is used to create memes. It typically includes specific visual elements, characters, or scenes with blank spaces or captions that can be customized, allowing users to easily create their versions of popular meme templates by adding personal or contextually relevant content. Despite extensive research on meme virality, the task of automatically identifying meme templates remains a challenge.
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of existing meme template identification methods, including both established approaches from the literature and novel techniques. We introduce a rigorous evaluation framework that not only assesses the ability of various methods to correctly identify meme templates but also tests their capacity to reject non-memes without false assignments. Our study involves extensive data collection from sites that provide meme annotations (Imgflip) and various social media platforms (Reddit, X, and Facebook) to ensure a diverse and representative dataset. We compare meme template identification methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations. These include supervised and unsupervised approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, distance-based classification, and density-based clustering. Our analysis helps researchers and practitioners choose suitable methods and points to future research directions in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Equitable Access to AI in Housing and Homelessness System of Care through Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The top priority of a Housing and Homelessness System of Care (HHSC) is to connect people experiencing homelessness to supportive housing. An HHSC typically consists of many agencies serving the same population. Information technology platforms differ in type and quality between agencies, so their data are usually isolated from one agency to another. Larger agencies may have sufficient data to train and test artificial intelligence (AI) tools but smaller agencies typically do not. To address this gap, we introduce a Federated Learning (FL) approach enabling all agencies to train a predictive model collaboratively without sharing their sensitive data. We demonstrate how FL can be used within an HHSC to provide all agencies equitable access to quality AI and further assist human decision-makers in the allocation of resources within HHSC. This is achieved while preserving the privacy of the people within the data by not sharing identifying information between agencies without their consent. Our experimental results using real-world HHSC data from Calgary, Alberta, demonstrate that our FL approach offers comparable performance with the idealized scenario of training the predictive model with data fully shared and linked between agencies.</description>

      <title>ArabLegalEval: A Multitask Benchmark for Assessing Arabic Legal Knowledge in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks. However, the evaluation of LLMs' legal knowledge, particularly in non-English languages such as Arabic, remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce ArabLegalEval, a multitask benchmark dataset for assessing the Arabic legal knowledge of LLMs. Inspired by the MMLU and LegalBench datasets, ArabLegalEval consists of multiple tasks sourced from Saudi legal documents and synthesized questions. In this work, we aim to analyze the capabilities required to solve legal problems in Arabic and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs. We explore the impact of in-context learning and investigate various evaluation methods. Additionally, we explore workflows for generating questions with automatic validation to enhance the dataset's quality. We benchmark multilingual and Arabic-centric LLMs, such as GPT-4 and Jais, respectively. We also share our methodology for creating the dataset and validation, which can be generalized to other domains. We hope to accelerate AI research in the Arabic Legal domain by releasing the ArabLegalEval dataset and code: https://github.com/Thiqah/ArabLegalEval</description>

      <title>Covert Bias: The Severity of Social Views' Unalignment Towards Implicit and Explicit Opinion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While various approaches have recently been studied for bias identification, little is known about how implicit language that does not explicitly convey a viewpoint affects bias amplification in large language models.To examine the severity of bias toward a view, we evaluated the performance of two downstream tasks where the implicit and explicit knowledge of social groups were used. First, we present a stress test evaluation by using a biased model in edge cases of excessive bias scenarios. Then, we evaluate how LLMs calibrate linguistically in response to both implicit and explicit opinions when they are aligned with conflicting viewpoints. Our findings reveal a discrepancy in LLM performance in identifying implicit and explicit opinions, with a general tendency of bias toward explicit opinions of opposing stances. Moreover, the bias-aligned models generate more cautious responses using uncertainty phrases compared to the unaligned (zero-shot) base models. The direct, incautious responses of the unaligned models suggest a need for further refinement of decisiveness by incorporating uncertainty markers to enhance their reliability, especially on socially nuanced topics with high subjectivity.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Benefits and Challenges of Demand Responsive Public Transit- A Case Study in the City of Charlotte, NC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Access to reliable public transportation is essential for addressing socio-economic disparities, particularly in low-income communities that rely heavily on transit for accessing jobs, healthcare, and essential services. This study investigates the challenges faced by transit-dependent populations in Charlotte, NC, focusing on the spatial and service-related inequities within the current public bus system. Our research initially evaluates critical issues such as extended wait times, unreliable schedules, and limited accessibility, which significantly impact the daily lives of low-income residents. In response to these challenges, we gathered data to assess the potential for a connected, demand-responsive bus system designed to minimize transit gaps and enhance service efficiency in the future. This evaluation included an analysis of the existing Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) mobile applications and the exploration of user acceptance for a proposed smart, on-demand transit technology. Through surveys conducted across key bus lines-including the Sprinter line and Bus Lines 7, 9, and 97-99-we identified significant shortcomings in the current system. However, our findings also indicate a strong willingness among participants to adopt new transit solutions, provided that they effectively address current issues and alleviate concerns related to smartphone accessibility, privacy, and trust. This research contributes valuable insights into the modernization of public transit systems in Charlotte, highlighting the importance of user-centric approaches in developing innovative, equitable, and efficient transportation solutions.</description>

      <title>Risks from Language Models for Automated Mental Healthcare: Ethics and Structure for Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amidst the growing interest in developing task-autonomous AI for automated mental health care, this paper addresses the ethical and practical challenges associated with the issue and proposes a structured framework that delineates levels of autonomy, outlines ethical requirements, and defines beneficial default behaviors for AI agents in the context of mental health support. We also evaluate fourteen state-of-the-art language models (ten off-the-shelf, four fine-tuned) using 16 mental health-related questionnaires designed to reflect various mental health conditions, such as psychosis, mania, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicidal tendencies. The questionnaire design and response evaluations were conducted by mental health clinicians (M.D.s). We find that existing language models are insufficient to match the standard provided by human professionals who can navigate nuances and appreciate context. This is due to a range of issues, including overly cautious or sycophantic responses and the absence of necessary safeguards. Alarmingly, we find that most of the tested models could cause harm if accessed in mental health emergencies, failing to protect users and potentially exacerbating existing symptoms. We explore solutions to enhance the safety of current models. Before the release of increasingly task-autonomous AI systems in mental health, it is crucial to ensure that these models can reliably detect and manage symptoms of common psychiatric disorders to prevent harm to users. This involves aligning with the ethical framework and default behaviors outlined in our study. We contend that model developers are responsible for refining their systems per these guidelines to safeguard against the risks posed by current AI technologies to user mental health and safety.
  Trigger warning: Contains and discusses examples of sensitive mental health topics, including suicide and self-harm.</description>

      <title>The Threats of Embodied Multimodal LLMs: Jailbreaking Robotic Manipulation in the Physical World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents an artificial intelligence system that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators, seamlessly integrating perception and action. This design enables AI to learn from and operate within complex, real-world environments. Large Language Models (LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devising plans for complex tasks. Consequently, they have progressively shown immense potential in empowering embodied AI, with LLM-based embodied AI emerging as a focal point of research within the community. It is foreseeable that, over the next decade, LLM-based embodied AI robots are expected to proliferate widely, becoming commonplace in homes and industries. However, a critical safety issue that has long been hiding in plain sight is: could LLM-based embodied AI perpetrate harmful behaviors? Our research investigates for the first time how to induce threatening actions in embodied AI, confirming the severe risks posed by these soon-to-be-marketed robots, which starkly contravene Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics and threaten human safety. Specifically, we formulate the concept of embodied AI jailbreaking and expose three critical security vulnerabilities: first, jailbreaking robotics through compromised LLM; second, safety misalignment between action and language spaces; and third, deceptive prompts leading to unaware hazardous behaviors. We also analyze potential mitigation measures and advocate for community awareness regarding the safety of embodied AI applications in the physical world.</description>

      <title>The Model Openness Framework: Promoting Completeness and Openness for Reproducibility, Transparency, and Usability in Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) offers unprecedented opportunities for research and innovation, but its commercialization has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open GAI models lack the necessary components for full understanding and reproducibility, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be ``open-source''. To address these concerns, we propose the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that rates machine learning models based on their completeness and openness, following principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. The MOF requires specific components of the model development lifecycle to be included and released under appropriate open licenses. This framework aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and help individuals and organizations identify models that can be safely adopted without restrictions. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, the MOF combats ``openwashing'' practices and establishes completeness and openness as primary criteria alongside the core tenets of responsible AI. Wide adoption of the MOF will foster a more open AI ecosystem, benefiting research, innovation, and adoption of state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Conditional Fairness for Generative AIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of generative AI (GenAI) models raises significant fairness concerns, addressed in this paper through novel characterization and enforcement techniques specific to GenAI. Unlike standard AI performing specific tasks, GenAI's broad functionality requires "conditional fairness" tailored to the context being generated, such as demographic fairness in generating images of poor people versus successful business leaders. We define two fairness levels: the first evaluates fairness in generated outputs, independent of prompts and models; the second assesses inherent fairness with neutral prompts. Given the complexity of GenAI and challenges in fairness specifications, we focus on bounding the worst case, considering a GenAI system unfair if the distance between appearances of a specific group exceeds preset thresholds. We also explore combinatorial testing for accessing relative completeness in intersectional fairness. By bounding the worst case, we develop a prompt injection scheme within an agent-based framework to enforce conditional fairness with minimal intervention, validated on state-of-the-art GenAI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework, "peer-induced fairness", to scientifically audit algorithmic fairness. It addresses a critical but often overlooked issue: distinguishing between adverse outcomes due to algorithmic discrimination and those resulting from individuals' insufficient capabilities. By utilizing counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques, such as the Single World Intervention Graph, this model-agnostic approach evaluates fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons and hypothesis testing. It also tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, offering a flexible, plug-and-play self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, while providing explainable feedback for those affected by unfavorable decisions.</description>

      <title>PsyDI: Towards a Personalized and Progressively In-depth Chatbot for Psychological Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03337</link>

Abstract: In the field of psychology, traditional assessment methods, such as standardized scales, are frequently critiqued for their static nature, lack of personalization, and reduced participant engagement, while comprehensive counseling evaluations are often inaccessible. The complexity of quantifying psychological traits further limits these methods. Despite advances with large language models (LLMs), many still depend on single-round Question-and-Answer interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PsyDI, a personalized and progressively in-depth chatbot designed for psychological measurements, exemplified by its application in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework. PsyDI leverages user-related multi-modal information and engages in customized, multi-turn interactions to provide personalized, easily accessible measurements, while ensuring precise MBTI type determination. To address the challenge of unquantifiable psychological traits, we introduce a novel training paradigm that involves learning the ranking of proxy variables associated with these traits, culminating in a robust score model for MBTI measurements. The score model enables PsyDI to conduct comprehensive and precise measurements through multi-turn interactions within a unified estimation context. Through various experiments, we validate the efficacy of both the score model and the PsyDI pipeline, demonstrating its potential to serve as a general framework for psychological measurements. Furthermore, the online deployment of PsyDI has garnered substantial user engagement, with over 3,000 visits, resulting in the collection of numerous multi-turn dialogues annotated with MBTI types, which facilitates further research. The source code for the training and web service components is publicly available as a part of OpenDILab at: https://github.com/opendilab/PsyDI</description>

      <title>Do GPT Language Models Suffer From Split Personality Disorder? The Advent Of Substrate-Free Psychometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research on emergence in large language models shows these display apparent human-like abilities and psychological latent traits. However, results are partly contradicting in expression and magnitude of these latent traits, yet agree on the worrisome tendencies to score high on the Dark Triad of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism, which, together with a track record of derailments, demands more rigorous research on safety of these models. We provided a state of the art language model with the same personality questionnaire in nine languages, and performed Bayesian analysis of Gaussian Mixture Model, finding evidence for a deeper-rooted issue. Our results suggest both interlingual and intralingual instabilities, which indicate that current language models do not develop a consistent core personality. This can lead to unsafe behaviour of artificial intelligence systems that are based on these foundation models, and are increasingly integrated in human life. We subsequently discuss the shortcomings of modern psychometrics, abstract it, and provide a framework for its species-neutral, substrate-free formulation.</description>
