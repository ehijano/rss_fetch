      <title>The possibility to experimentally determine the structure of a fermionic vacuum in quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the fermionic vacuum is a continuum of randomly created and annihilated virtual electron-positron pairs. In this case, in the strong electromagnetic fields, vacuum creation of real electron-positron pairs is possible. In particular, in the standard QED in a strong uniform electrical field, the Schwinger effect is implemented. Currently, there exist the QED versions with empty fermionic vacuum without fluctuations of creation and annihilation of virtual electron-positron pairs. These versions are the (QED)FW in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, the $(QED)_{KG}$ with spinor equations of the Klein-Gordon type, the $(QED)_{DN}$ with opposite signs in front of particle and antiparticle masses in Dirac equations and with the use of only states with positive energies in S-matrix elements. The latter relates to both real and virtual energy states. In this paper, we propose to carry out a set of experiments at colliders with collisions of heavy ions to determine the nature of the fermionic vacuum. The measurements of the emission of electron-positron pairs depending on the total charge of colliding ions $Z_{\Sigma} = 146 \div 184$ show the structure of a fermionic vacuum in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scalar Leptoquarks at Muon Collider via Indirect Signatures and Right-Handed Neutrino-Assisted Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the discovery prospects of the scalar leptoquark doublet $\widetilde{R}_{2}({3},{2},1/6)$ at a future high-energy muon collider, considering both direct and indirect search strategies. For indirect search, we probe the relevant Yukawa couplings by analyzing the dijet final state via virtual exchange of the leptoquark. Even with a sub-$\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa coupling, we achieve a 5$\sigma$ sensitivity up to leptoquark mass $ \sim 4$ TeV ($7$ TeV) at $\sqrt{s}=5, (10)$ TeV center-of-mass energy with $\mathcal{L} = 3 {ab}^{-1}$ ($10 ab^{-1}$) integrated luminosity. For direct search, we consider the pair and single production of leptoquarks and their subsequent decay to a right-handed neutrino and a light jet. Direct searches simultaneously target leptoquarks and right-handed neutrinos across four production modes--Pair/Single Symmetric and Pair/Single Asymmetric--enabled by Yukawa coupling-driven decays. A unified and minimal selection strategy requiring two muons and at least four jets proves effective across all modes and for leptoquark masses in a wide range. We demonstrate that with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings, the single production channel can probe leptoquark masses up to 3 TeV (6 TeV) for $\sqrt s=5$ TeV (10 TeV). Our results highlight the superior sensitivity of muon collider over HL-LHC and the power of a simplified, benchmark-independent search strategy in accessing TeV-scale new physics.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in a Three-Brane Randall-Sundrum Scenario out of the Evanescent Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nature of Dark Matter (DM), that constitutes approximately 25\% of the energy density in the Universe, is still eluding us. An intriguing possibility is that DM does indeed interacts with SM particles only gravitationally (the only mean by which we have detected it so far), albeit in an extra-dimensional scenario yet it has not been possible to detect it by some non-gravitational means. In a three-brane Randall-Sundrum setup, with DM located on a Deep Infra-Red GeV-TeV brane, and the SM on an Infra-Red TeV-PeV one, it was shown to be possible to recover the observed DM relic abundance and somewhat relax the hierarchy problem, whilst avoiding LHC stringent bounds on DM and KK graviton masses that constrain severely similar two-brane setups. The phenomenological results, however, has been obtained under the assumption that the bulk curvatures on the left ($k_1$) and the right ($k_2$) of the intermediate IR-brane are identical, $k_2 \to k_1$. Since the brane tension $\sigma_{\rm IR}$ of the intermediate brane is proportional to $k_2 - k_1$ and, therefore, vanishes, it is clear that this limit (for which the IR-brane becomes {\em evanescent}) is unphysical. We could say that this is {\em no brane}: if the brane tension of a brane vanishes, there is no brane in the bulk (pun intended). In this paper, therefore, we study in detail the theoretical framework needed to explore this interesting phenomenological possibility, {\em out of the evanescent brane limit}. We show that most of the formul\ae $\,$used in the {\em evanescent limit} are still valid for ${\cal O}(1)$ differences between $k_1$ and $k_2$ (thus, introducing no new unjustified hierarchy in the bulk). Once the relevant couplings of radions and KK gravitons are computed, we study the (enlarged) parameter space of the model looking for the region in which the relic DM abundance is recovered.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff: Chiral Perturbation Theory Tests via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the scattering of GeV energy beam particles off the Coulomb field of a nucleus. In this context, the Coulomb field behaves like a target of $\gamma^*$ virtual photons, with the target density being proportional to Z$^2$. Henry Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the $\pi^0$ lifetime by measuring the production cross section for the process $\gamma\gamma^* \rightarrow \pi^0$. When a $\gamma$ ray beam is used, Primakoff scattering is effectively represents $\gamma\gamma^*$ scattering involving hundreds of MeV gamma rays. We begin by describing Primakoffs scientific career and personal life. Then, we will review his studies on Primakoff scattering related to pion polarizability and the $\gamma\rightarrow\pi\pi\pi$ chiral anomaly at CERN COMPASS, as well as the $\pi^0$ lifetime study carried out at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). We highlight the good agreement between these studies and the predictions of 2-flavor (u,d) Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). Additionally, we explain the necessity of future Primakoff reaction studies involving kaons and $\eta$ mesons to evaluate how effectively three-flavor (u, d, s) ChPT accounts for the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Flavour from Fractal Mass Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the underlying flavour structure of the Standard Model could be determined by mass chains on a fractal geometry. We consider, as an example, the theory space on a Sierpinski-like geometry. The fermion mass chains on a Sierpinski-like geometry with three decorations (iterations) lead to three zero modes, which can be identified with the three generations of the Standard Model. This framework also reproduces the measured charged and neutral lepton masses and mixing angles with very few parameters. We also briefly discuss the possible extension to the quark sector.</description>

      <title>Dissipative contributions to spin polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing the Zubarev non-equilibrium density operator method and a first-order gradient expansion, we provide a comprehensive classification of all possible spin polarization effects. A key finding is that, with the unique exception of those induced by the gradient of the spin potential, all first-order dissipative corrections are chiral, implying their dependence on parity-breaking interactions or chiral imbalance. The work also introduces new non-dissipative phenomena akin to the Spin Hall Effect, including the Chiral Spin Hall Effect, which offers a novel observable to probe QCD topological configurations.</description>

      <title>Surveying the theory space of pion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a holographic model to survey the space of strongly coupled SU(Nc) gauge dynamics with QCD-like chiral symmetry breaking pattern for quarks in the fundamental representation. We systematically identify the light degrees of freedom (rho, sigma and pi mesons) that would make up the dark sector as a function of Nf, Nc and a common quark mass scale. We identify seven distinct effective theories that are of interest to explore and make a first summary of the expected dark matter phenomenology. Amongst our results we conclude that QCD-like models where the low energy theory is described purely in terms of pions struggle to generate a large enough Mpi/fpi value so these theories will need extra relic density generation mechanisms to be viable. The largest space of models (with an intermediate quark mass) have both the sigma and rho lying below 2 Mpi and are largely unexplored in the literature so far. Regions with just one of rho or sigma light are possible in constrained parameter regions. These states aid the pion relic density generation as needed for valid theories. The sigma always lies above the pi mass becoming degenerate with the pi in the extreme walking limit.</description>

      <title>Engineering Confining Dilatons: A WKB Inverse Problem in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a WKB-based inverse problem approach within the framework of holographic bottom-up QCD to engineer confining dilatons from hadronic mass spectra. Starting from a general parameterization of nonlinear radial Regge trajectories, $M_n^2=a(n+b)^\nu$, we apply the Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) formula to derive the large-z behavior of the corresponding holographic confining potential. This potential is inversely related to the dilaton field profile, leading naturally to a non-quadratic dilaton $\Phi(z)=(\kappa\,z)^{2-\alpha}$, where the parameters ($\kappa$, $\alpha$) are uniquely determined by the spectral parameters ($a$,$\nu$). We successfully test this method by fitting the spectra of heavy quarkonia ($c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$), achieving good agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, we extend this formalism to describe the spectroscopy of tetraquark states by superimposing an additional potential term, derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equation for diquarks, onto the standard mesonic confining potential. This work establishes a powerful and flexible bottom-up framework for deriving confinement directly from spectral data, applicable to both conventional and exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Dipole Amplitude in the Dipole Picture as a mathematical Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can be written into a discrete linear inverse problem, in an analogous manner as can be done for computed tomography. To this formulation of the problem, we apply standard inverse problems methods and algorithms to reconstruct known dipole amplitudes from simulated reduced cross section data with realistic precision. The main difference of this approach to previous works is that this implementation does not require any fit parametrization of the dipole amplitude. The freedom from parametrization also enables us for the first time to quantify the uncertainties of the inferred dipole amplitude in a novel more general framework. This mathematical approach to small-$x$ phenomenology opens a path to parametrization bias free inference of the dipole amplitude from HERA and Electron--Ion Collider data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of polarization transfer from the initial electron to the bremsstrahlung photon in the electron-nucleus scattering (Bethe-Heitler process) are considered. The calculation is done without the assumption of smallness of the electron mass. Detailed comparison with a previous well-known works is done. Some issues related with electron mass neglecting are shown and commented. The results are applicable to the modelling of the polarized cross sections at low energies (even at a few electron mass scale).</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized twist-3 parton distribution functions $f_{LT}(x)$ for the spin-1 deuteron by using twist-2 relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor-polarized twist-3 parton distribution functions (PDFs) $f_{LT}(x)$ are calculated for the spin-1 deuteron by using twist-2 relations, which are similar to the Wandzura-Wilczek relation and the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule in the spin-1/2 nucleon, together with tensor-polarized twist-2 PDFs $f_{1LL}(x)$. The PDFs are shown for $f_{LT}(x)$ at $Q^2 =2.5$ GeV$^2$, where the tensor-polarized PDFs $f_{1LL}(x)$ are provided. The $x$-dependence of $f_{LT}(x)$ is similar to $f_{1LL}(x)$, and the magnitude of $f_{LT}(x)$ is roughly of the order of $f_{1LL}(x)$. In experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), higher-twist effects could be sizable because $Q^2$ values are not very large in comparison with the hadronic scale of 1 GeV$^2$. Therefore, the JLab experiments could provide a good opportunity to investigate the twist-3 distributions $f_{LT}(x)$ in addition to the twist-2 ones $f_{1LL}(x)$. Furthermore, these tensor-polarized PDFs could be investigated at future Electron-Ion Colliders (EICs) and hadron accelerator facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations of deeply virtual Compton scattering: investigating twist-4 kinematic power corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we include kinematic power corrections up to twist-four to the deeply virtual Compton scattering dispersion relation. We demonstrate that, both for (pseudo-)scalar and spin-$1/2$ targets, the formal expression of the $n$-subtracted leading-twist dispersion relations is preserved. However, the expression of the subtracted constants is modified by the kinematic powers. Importantly, the minimal-subtracted dispersion relation for the helicity-conserving amplitude, previously thought to depend only on the Polyakov-Weiss $D$-term, now also depends on the double distributions $F$ and $K$. Such a mixing may be critical for the Jefferson Lab kinematic range, as it is not suppressed for typical values of $t$ and $Q^{2}$ in the valence region. We therefore expect a strong impact on attempts to extract pressure forces from DVCS data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation, which describes the precession of the spin of a charged Dirac particle moving in a homogeneous electromagnetic field, is generalized to include also other homogeneous background fields. The treatment incorporates observable coefficients that govern operators of mass dimensions three through six in the underlying Dirac effective field theory. A relativistic formulation valid in arbitrary inertial frames is obtained. The results are applicable to searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model, including searches for Lorentz and CPT violation.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo challenges for strong field quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assisted Schwinger effect, which is predicted to display non-perturbative quantum tunnelling, is expected to be produced in precision lab experiments with electron beams and intense lasers. Indeed, many novel effects predicted by a theory which incorporates the laser field exactly, can be probed experimentally with the proper application of theory and simulation. Among predicted first order effects are a rest mass shift and harmonic Compton scattering. Higher order effects include resonant transition rates which become apparent when scanned over specific kinematic parameters. The underpinning of the theory and experiment is a Monte Carlo simulation tool which precisely links experimental realities to the expected theoretical transition rates. We report on the progress of such a tool here.</description>

      <title>Searching for a Dark Dimension Right-handed Neutrino in KATRIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility that the Right-handed neutrino is a five-dimensional state propagating along a micron size extra dimension, as required in the dark dimension proposal. We work out the signatures of R-neutrino production in KATRIN experiment and compare them with those of a sterile neutrino which manifests by a kink in the electron energy spectrum of the beta-decay at a value corresponding to the sterile neutrino mass. We explore the allowed parameter space of the compactification scale and the R-neutrino bulk mass versus the Yukawa coupling, and show that a large part of it is within KATRIN's sensitivity. When the bulk mass is much smaller than the compactification scale, several kinks could be observed corresponding to the positions of the R-neutrino Kaluza-Klein excitations, while for large bulk mass there will be effectively one kink at the position of the bulk mass.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin entanglement in diffractive heavy quark production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the spin density matrix of a heavy quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$, $c\bar{c}$ or $s\bar{s}$) diffractively produced in Deep Inelastic Scattering and Ultraperipheral Collisions. We show that the Pomeron exchange leaves characteristic imprints on the entanglement pattern between the quark and the antiquark. For the longitudinally polarized virtual photon, the pair always exhibits maximal entanglement and maximal violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. For the transversely polarized photon, the pair is always entangled and Bell-violating, reaching maximal entanglement and maximal violation simultaneously when the transverse momentum approximately equals the quark mass.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Theorems and Double-Copy Structure in Scattering Amplitudes of Massive Kaluza-Klein States with Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05199v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in compactified five-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. Focusing on tree-level $2\to2$ processes, we analyze the leading-order amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields and KK gauge/gravitational Goldstone bosons. By imposing the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) within warped KK theories, we systematically reconstruct the leading-order amplitudes for physical KK gauge bosons and gravitons, thereby circumventing the intricate energy cancellations inherent in physical amplitudes. Within this framework, the correspondence between GAET and GRET arises as a direct manifestation of the leading-order double-copy relation in the high-energy expansion. This connection provides a foundation for extending the BCJ double-copy construction to four-point amplitudes involving bulk KK matter fields, and further generalizes to arbitrary $N$-point cases, enabling a systematic derivation of the corresponding gravitational amplitudes with consistent incorporation of KK matter fields at leading order.</description>

      <title>Updated bounds on ultra-light dark matter from the tiniest galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle mass of dark matter (DM) was previously constrained using kinematics of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies to $m &gt; 3 \times 10^{-19}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This constraint, which excludes the "fuzzy" range of ultra-light dark matter from comprising all of the DM, relies on an estimate of the heating rate from fuzzy dark matter (FDM) wave interference using linear perturbation theory. Here, we compare the results of this perturbative calculation to full Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations of the evolution of star particles in FDM halos. This comparison confirms theoretical expectations that FDM heating is stronger in fully nonlinear simulations due to the formation of a dense central soliton whose fluctuations enhance gravitational perturbations, and that bounds on the DM particle mass using this perturbative method are indeed conservative. We also show that these bounds are not affected by possible tidal stripping, since for dwarf satellites like Segue 1, the tidal radius is much larger than the observed size of the galaxy. We further show that the constraints on the mass cannot be evaded by invoking DM self-interactions, due to constraints on the self-interaction from large-scale structure. Lastly, we show that if the recently discovered system Ursa Major III/UNIONS I is a galaxy, the observed properties of this object strengthen the lower bound on the DM mass by over an order of magnitude, to $m &gt; 8 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{eV}$, at 95% confidence. This constraint could further be strengthened considerably by more precise measurements of the size and velocity dispersion of this and other similar galaxies, and by using full Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations.</description>

Abstract: Normalized wave packets express particles in nature. Their sizes are determined by their interactions with matter, and depend on environments. Nevertheless, these characterize scatterings processes in realistic situations, and govern the absolute values of transition probabilities. This paper studies the wave packet sizes and their implications.</description>

      <title>Do null defects dream of conformal symmetry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of null line defects in Lorentzian conformal field theories in various dimensions. We show that null lines geometrically preserve a larger set of conformal isometries than their timelike and spacelike counterparts, explain a connection to non-relativistic systems, and constrain correlation functions using conformal Ward identities. We argue that having conformal symmetry, and especially maximal conformal symmetry, is extremely constraining -- nearly trivializing systems. We consider the (3+1)d scalar pinning field and null Wilson line examples in depth, compare their results to ultraboosted limits of timelike and spacelike systems, and argue that shockwave-type solutions are generic. A number of physical consistency conditions compel us to consider defect correlators as distributions on a restricted subspace of Schwartz test functions. Consequently, we provide a resolution to the longstanding problem of ultraboosted limits of gauge potentials in classical electromagnetism. We briefly analyze semi-infinite sources for the scalar in ($4-\epsilon$)-dimensions, consider solutions on the Lorentzian cylinder, and introduce the ''perfect null polygon'' which emerges for compatibility between Gauss' law and ultraboosted limits.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous collapse effects on relativistic fermionic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study expands the spontaneous collapse assumptions into the relativistic quantum field theory framework for Dirac fields. By solving Lindblad's master equation using the Keldysh formalism, the effective action is derived, which captures the dynamics of fermions with spontaneous collapse represented as an imaginary self-interaction term. Utilizing the corresponding Dyson-Schwinger equations at 1-loop approximation, the effective mass induced by the nonlinearity is computed. The findings indicate the presence of a new mechanism that introduces a qualitative change in the mass spectrum, where the particle's mass becomes complex. This mechanism, which generates a Lorentz invariance violation in the infrared regime, recovers the Lorentz invariance in the ultraviolet regime. The corresponding hydrodynamics of the system is analyzed through the Keldysh component of the propagator, and a conserved charge is found. In contrast, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be non-conserving. This phenomenon represents a new contribution to the understanding of the spontaneous collapse and the transition from quantum to the classical realm.</description>

      <title>New phases in QCD at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and baryon density is crucial for describing matter in heavy-ion collisions and the interior of neutron stars. While the transition from the confined phase to the deconfined phase has been extensively studied at vanishing chemical potential, recent theoretical work suggests the existence of intermediate phases with partial deconfinement, where only a subset of the color degrees of freedom is deconfined. In this paper, we study the generalization of partial deconfinement in QCD in the Veneziano large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit ($N_{\rm f}/N_{\rm c}$ fixed) to finite baryon chemical potential. We find that the partially deconfined phase has finer structure, and hence that there are four phases in QCD at finite temperature and moderately large chemical potential: complete confinement, complete deconfinement, and two kinds of partial deconfinement. A key ingredient is the refined understanding of the meaning of the 'Gross-Witten-Wadia point', i.e., the opening of a gap in the distribution of Polyakov line phases: either string condensation or baryon condensation causes the GWW transition. As a by-product, we observe the emergence of the QCD critical point from the interplay between baryon condensation and partial deconfinement. While our approach is necessarily qualitative due to the fermion sign problem, it provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding the rich phase structure of dense QCD matter and offers new perspectives on the location and nature of the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>rho-Meson Nucleon Scattering Length from CLAS Threshold Photoproduction Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending our study of the vector meson-nucleon scattering lengths (summary is given in Ref.~\cite{Strakovsky:2021vyk}), we are focusing on the $\rho$-meson case using recent CLAS threshold data for the reaction $\gamma p \to \rho p$ within the meson-baryon reaction model~\cite{CLAS:2018drk}. The total $\sigma_t(\gamma p\to \rho p)$ and $\sigma_t(\gamma p\to \omega p)$ cross sections are close below the momentum of the vector meson in CM $q = 0.2~\mathrm{GeV/c}$. Then the $\rho p$ photoproduction cross section grows rapidly. Our result for $\rho N$ scattering length is a factor of 4 smaller than the size of the hadron and the phenomenological determination of the $\omega$ nucleon scattering length using threshold photoproduction cross sections. The observed difference between $\rho N$ and $\omega N$ scattering lengths is of interest for further understanding within the hadron structure theory.</description>

      <title>Parton physics from a heavy-quark operator product expansion: Lattice QCD calculation of the fourth moment of the pion distribution amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is an essential non-perturbative input for a range of high-energy exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics. Building on our previous work, the continuum limit of the fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined in quenched QCD using quark masses which correspond to a pion mass of $m_\pi = 550$ MeV. This calculation finds $\langle\xi^2\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\langle \xi^4 \rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ where the first error indicates the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty from the analysis and the second indicates the uncertainty from working with Wilson coefficients computed to next-to-leading order. These results are presented in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\mu = 2$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Few is different: deciphering many-body dynamics in mesoscopic quantum gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent macroscopic descriptions of matter, such as hydrodynamics, are central to our description of complex physical systems across a wide spectrum of energy scales. The conventional understanding of these many-body phenomena has recently been shaken by a number of experimental findings. Collective behavior of matter has been observed in \emph{mesoscopic} systems, such as high-energy hadron-hadron collisions, or ultra-cold gases with only few strongly interacting fermions. In such systems, the separation of scales between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics (at the heart of any effective theory) is inapplicable. To address the conceptual challenges that arise from these observations and explore the universality of emergent descriptions of matter, the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force was assembled. This document summarizes the RRTF discussions on recent theoretical and experimental advances in this rapidly developing field. Leveraging technological breakthroughs in the control of quantum systems, we can now quantitatively explore what it means for a system to exhibit behavior beyond the sum of its individual parts. In particular, the report highlights how the (in)applicability of hydrodynamics and other effective theories can be probed across three principal frontiers: the size frontier, the equilibrium frontier, and the interaction frontier.</description>

      <title>Gaussian curvature and Lyapunov exponent as probes of black hole phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian curvature of unstable null orbits. The Gaussian curvature exhibits multivaluedness near the phase transition point of a first-order phase transition. Numerical investigations of Reissner-Nordstrom Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS), Hayward-AdS, and Hayward-Letelier-AdS black holes demonstrate that this geometric multivalued region coincides precisely with the spinodal region calculated by black hole thermodynamics. Using the known relation $K=-\lambda^2$ linking orbital geometry to chaotic dynamics, we show that this geometric feature also satisfies the critical exponents predicted by mean-field theory, consistent with those derived from Lyapunov exponents. Our work demonstrates that Gaussian curvature can serve as an alternative effective tool to study the phase structure of black holes.</description>

      <title>Application of Fermion Quantum Number F and Unit Electroweak Charge F0 in the Electroweak Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the previous work, the traditional flavor-related additive quantum numbers including the hypercharge Y, the isospin I, the isospin projection I3, and four flavor quantum numbers (S, C, B* and T) were substituted by the fermion quantum number F and the unit electroweak charge F0. The empirical selection rules in electroweak interaction were found that they can be interpreted by conservation of F. F and F0, same as the electric charge Q, are conserved in electromagnetic interaction, weak interaction and strong interaction. The relations between the new conservation laws and the internal symmetries are: Indistinguishability of the fermions results in F conservation, and indistinguishability of relative phases of wave functions of the fermions results in F0 conservation. The formula of relation between Q, F and F0 for all the fermions is more general than the Gell-Mann-Nishijima formula. In this paper, the weak isospin Iw3 and the weak hypercharge Yw in the electroweak theory are demonstrated to be equivalent to F/2 and F0 respectively. Therefore, we can unify the traditional flavor-related additive quantum numbers and the additive quantum numbers in the electroweak theory by using only two numbers: F and F0. Furthermore, Q and new defined neutral current weak charge QZ in electroweak interaction can be expressed by mixture of F and F0 via the Weinberg angle thetaW. In consequence, electroweak interaction is separated into two parts: one is neutral current electroweak interaction, including electromagnetic interaction and neutral current weak interaction, having no change of particle types with only exchange of the neutral bosons, determined by conservation of F and F0, and the other is charged current weak interaction which has change of particle types, i.e., decays and their equivalent reactions, determined by conservation of F.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of relic neutrino detection methods within the Standard Model, extended to include right-chiral neutrino singlets with Majorana mass terms. In particular, we study neutrino capture on unstable nuclei, the Stodolsky effect, coherent scattering, and an accelerator experiment. We demonstrate that the sensitivity transitions smoothly between Dirac and Majorana regimes, depending on the scale of lepton number violation. Importantly, neutral current interactions lead to transitions between the light and heavy neutrino states, necessitating the use of a density matrix formalism for accurate sensitivity calculations. As the oldest source of neutrinos in the universe, relic neutrinos would be able to provide an ultimate constraint on the lepton number violating scale, $m_R\gtrsim 10^{-33}~{\rm eV}$, below which neutrinos would behave as Dirac fermions for all practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Neutrino Lasers from Radioactive Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance emerges from collective spontaneous emission in optically pumped gases, and is characterized by photon emission enhancements of up to $\frac{1}{4}N^{2}$ in an $N$ atom system. The gain mechanism derives from correlations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated emission as in lasing, so analog of this process should be possible for fermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino emission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis for a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based on a condensate of electron-capture isotope $^{83}$Rb could exhibit effective radioactive decay rates accelerated from 86.2 days to minutes in viably sized rubidium condensates of $10^{6}$ atoms.</description>

      <title>Right-handed neutrinos: seesaw models and signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to right-handed neutrinos as a simple extension to the Standard Model (SM), focussing on seesaw models and their possible experimental signatures. We preface this with a review of the lepton sector of the SM, where charged lepton masses arise from Yukawa couplings and neutrino Majorana masses from the Weinberg operator, leading to a unitary lepton mixing matrix. We first introduce a single right-handed neutrino and the seesaw mechanism, yielding a heavy neutral lepton, then generalise the results to the canonical case of three right-handed neutrinos within a general parameterisation, leading to non-unitary lepton mixing and three heavy neutral leptons, which can detected directly or indirectly via lepton flavour violation or neutrinoless double beta decay. We show how the sequential dominance of three right-handed neutrinos with diagonal masses naturally leads to an effective two right-handed neutrino model with lepton mixing angle predictions in the constrained cases, but unobservable heavy neutral leptons. On the other hand, with degenerate off-diagonal masses, the two right-handed neutrinos can form a single heavy and observable Dirac neutrino, within a two Higgs doublet or Majoron model. Finally we discuss extra singlet neutrinos which can lead to either a double seesaw or an inverse seesaw, depending on their Majorana masses, where the latter allows observable heavy neutral leptons, and the possibility of a minimal inverse seesaw model where mixing angles can be predicted.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Sensors for Ultraheavy Dark Matter Searches via Long-range Forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale are theoretically well-motivated, and it has been suggested that it might be possible to search for dark matter solely via gravitational interactions in this mass range. In this work, we explore the pathway towards searching for dark matter candidates with masses around the Planck-scale using mechanical sensors while considering realistic experimental constraints, and develop analysis techniques needed to conduct such searches. These dark matter particles are expected to leave tracks as their signature in mechanical sensor arrays, and we show that we can effectively search for such tracks using statistical approaches to track-finding. We analyze a range of possible experimental setups and compute sensitivity projections for searches for ultraheavy dark matter coupling to the Standard Model via long-range forces. We find that while a search for Planck-scale dark matter purely via gravitational couplings would be exceedingly difficult, requiring $\sim 80\,\mathrm{dB}$ of quantum noise reduction with a $100^3$ array of devices, there is a wide range of currently unexplored dark matter candidates which can be searched for with already existing or near-term experimental platforms.</description>

Abstract: Single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation (SIA) represents the cleanest process for investigating the dynamics of parton hadronization, as encapsulated in parton fragmentation functions. In this letter, we present, for the first time, the analytical computation of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the coefficient functions for SIA at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) accuracy, achieving the highest precision to date for hadron production processes. Utilizing the BaBar measurement as a benchmark, we assess the phenomenological implications of this high-precision calculation. Our findings demonstrate a substantial reduction in scale uncertainties at N$^3$LO and offer an improved description of the experimental data compared to lower-order calculations. This advancement underscores the importance of higher-order corrections in achieving a more accurate understanding of hadronization processes.</description>

      <title>Inferring correlated distributions: boosted top jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the understanding of signal and background distributions in signal-region is a valuable key to enhance any analysis in collider physics. This is usually a difficult task because -- among others -- signal and backgrounds are hard to discriminate in signal-region, simulations may reach a limit of reliability if they need to model non-perturbative QCD, and distributions are multi-dimensional and many times may be correlated within each class. Bayesian density estimation is a technique that leverages prior knowledge and data correlations to effectively extract information from data in signal-region. In this work we extend previous works on data-driven mixture models for meaningful unsupervised signal extraction in collider physics to incorporate correlations between features. Using a standard dataset of top and QCD jets, we show how simulators, despite having an expected bias, can be used to inject sufficient inductive nuance into an inference model in terms of priors to then be corrected by data and estimate the true correlated distributions between features within each class. We compare the model with and without correlations to show how the signal extraction is sensitive to their inclusion and we quantify the improvement due to the inclusion of correlations using both supervised and unsupervised metrics.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Neutrino Secret Interactions from Multi-messenger Neutrinos Scattering on C$\nu$B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new constraints on neutrino secret interactions ($\nu$SI) by studying high-energy neutrinos from well-known astrophysical sources, such as SN1987A, the blazars TXS $0506+056$ and PKS $0735+178$, the active galaxy NGC 1068, and the KM3-230213A neutrino event. We expand existing limits by probing a previously unconstrained region of the mediator mass parameter space. Our study focuses on Dirac neutrinos interacting with a massive spin-one boson as they propagate through the Cosmic Neutrino Background, while also examining Majorana and Dirac neutrinos scattering via a scalar mediator. We consider both ultra-relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, establishing bounds on the $\nu$SI coupling constant across the wide $\nu$SI mediator mass range. Our results, obtained using analytical methods, demonstrate significant constraints on the $\nu$SI vector coupling in the low mediator mass region, compared to the scalar coupling scenario.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Monte Carlo calculation of compact $T_{cs0}$ and $T_{c\bar{s}0}$ tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration amplitude analysis of the decays $B^+ \to D^+ D^- K^+$, $B^+ \to D^- D_s^+ \pi^+$, and $B^0 \to \bar{D}^0 D_s^+ \pi^-$ suggested the existence of two new resonant $J^P=0^+$ states with minimum quark content $\bar{u} \bar{d} s c$ and $\bar{s} \bar{u} d c$/$\bar{s} \bar{d} u c$, named $T_{cs0}$ and $T_{c\bar{s}0}$, respectively. In this work, we used the diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) method to compute the masses of those tetraquarks within the framework of the constituent quark model. We describe the systems as compact structures, not as diquark/antidiquark or meson/meson arrangements. In this context, compact means that we used directly the eigenvectors of the spin, color and flavor operators without any splitting and/or (re)combination of smaller units. This allows us to deduce the existence of two distinct bound configurations for each composition, corresponding to ground and excited flavor states. In both cases, the excited flavor states are the ones with masses comparable to the ones observed by LHCb. In addition, our analysis allows us to assign unambiguously an isospin value of $I$=1 to the experimentally obtained $T_{cs0}$ tetraquark.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.A comparison with previous data driven ($e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays) estimates is done.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the quantum computing method has been used to address the sign problem in traditional Monte Carlo lattice gauge theory (LGT) simulations. We propose that the Coulomb gauge (CG) should be used in quantum simulations of LGT. This is because the redundant degrees of freedom can be eliminated in CG. Therefore, the Hamiltonian in CG does not need to be gauge invariance, allowing the gauge field to be discretized naively. We point out that discretized gauge fields and fermion fields should be placed on momentum and position lattices, respectively. Under this scheme, the CG condition and Gauss's law can be conveniently preserved by solving algebraic equations of polarization vectors. We also discuss the procedure for mapping gauge fields to qubits, and then demonstrate the polynomial scaling of qubits and the complexity of time evolution. Finally, we calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the U(1) plaquette operator and the Wilson loop on a classical device to test the performance of our discretization scheme.</description>

      <title>511 keV Galactic Photons from a Dark Matter Spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that a dark matter (DM) spike around the Galactic Center's (GC) supermassive black hole, Sgr A*, could account for most of the bulge's measured 511 keV line intensity while remaining cosmologically compatible. DM annihilation can be the primary source of the 511 keV line emission without violating constraints from disk emission observations and in-flight positron annihilation with the interstellar medium, provided the disk emission is dominated by an astrophysical source of low-energy positrons. We find that a DM mass up to approximately 20 MeV, either with a Gondolo-Silk spike or one softened by stellar heating, could explain the observed 511 keV bulge emission profile. Our proposal can be tested by future observations of the continuum diffuse emission close to the GC.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Second-order Gravitational Waves in Axion-like Hybrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a hybrid inflation model driven by an axion-like particle (ALP) $\phi$. The model predicts a spectral index $n_s \simeq 0.964$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 0.003$, in agreement with Planck data and potentially testable by next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments such as CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD. We find that the PBH mass and the peak of the associated scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) spectrum are correlated with the ALP mass. In particular, PBHs in the mass range $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ can constitute either the entire dark matter (DM) content of the universe or a significant fraction of it. The predicted second-order GWs from this mechanism are within the sensitivity reach of future observatories like LISA and ET. The typical reheating temperature in the model is around $10^6 - 10^7$ GeV is consistent with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, shows they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present study, we investigate the possible existence of negative charged kaons and neutral anti-kaons in neutron stars by employing the relativistic mean field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K}^{0}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to simultaneously explain the current variety of astrophysical objects, it is essential to resurrect a scenario of two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Probing a muonic force with the periastron advance in binary pulsar systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsars, highly magnetized, rotating neutron stars, can have significant muon abundances in their dense cores, making them promising environments to probe ultralight mediators coupled to muons. The precise measurement of periastron advance in binary pulsar systems provides a sensitive probe of such long-range forces. In this work, we study the periastron advance constraints from binary pulsar systems on the ultralight muonic mediators. We compute the muon number fraction in neutron stars, by properly taking into account the suppression effect of the long-range muonic force. We find that the periastron advance constraints impose the most stringent constraints on ultralight muonic mediators in the mass range of $\simeq(10^{-17},\,2\times10^{-15})$ eV, probing muonic couplings as small as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-21})$, which surpass the limits from LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave measurements, by about an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate new physics effects on coherent elastic neutrino nucleus scattering within the framework of nonstandard interactions and generalized neutrino interactions. Additionally, we examine the possibility of light mediators from a simplified model that includes all possible Lorentz-invariant interactions of vector, axialvector, scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensor types. Constraints and allowed regions at the $90\%$ CL for masses and couplings in each new physics scenario have been obtained through the analysis of TEXONO data, which includes two datasets from a high-purity $n$-type point contact germanium detector in 2016 and an advanced $p$-type point contact Ge detector in 2025. The results are presented in comparison with other reactor and accelerator-based neutrino experiments for complementarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the different degrees of freedom underlying far-from-equilibrium scaling behaviour in a relativistic, single-component $\mathrm{O}(1)$ scalar field theory in two and three spatial dimensions. In such a strongly correlated many-body system, identifying the respective roles of nonlinear wave excitations and defect dynamics is a prerequisite for understanding the universal character of time evolution far from equilibrium and thus the different possible universality classes of nonthermal fixed points. Using unequal-time two-point correlation functions, we extract information about the dominant infrared excitations and study their connections to the turbulent dynamics of topological defects created in the system. In three dimensions, the primary excitations are identified as kelvon quasiparticles, which are quantised Kelvin waves propagating along vortex lines, while in two dimensions, vortices are point defects, and the infrared dynamics is dominated by bound-state like excitations similar to Kelvin waves. In both cases, the kelvon excitations are found to be characterised by distinct time-evolving dispersion relations, subject to the coarsening dynamics close to the respective nonthermal fixed point and, thus, to the decay of superfluid turbulence in the system. Our results underline the role of topological defects and their influence on the universal dynamics of strongly correlated systems near nonthermal fixed points, complementing the analysis of large-$N$ models in $\mathrm{O}(N)$ systems.</description>

      <title>Interference with Gravitational Instability: Hot and Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave or fuzzy dark matter produced with high momenta behaves in many ways like hot particle dark matter while also possessing seemingly different phenomenology due to wave interference. We develop wave perturbation theory to show that white noise density fluctuations generated by the interference of high-momenta waves are gravitationally unstable in the usual way during matter domination above the free streaming scale and stabilize below the free streaming scale, much like the analogous effects for massive neutrinos in hot dark matter. We verify and illustrate these effects in the density power spectra of Newtonian Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. In the cosmological context, this would cause a gradual suppression of the initial white noise isocurvature perturbations below the free streaming scale at matter radiation equality, unlike cold dark matter isocurvature fluctuations, and virial stability of dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation in QED Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the issue of estimating dynamical parameters in quantum electrodynamics. We numerically compute the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) of physical parameters in electron-muon and Compton scattering at tree level. In particular, we consider the estimation of centre-of-mass three-momentum magnitude and polar scattering angle through measurements on the internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial states. The QFIM values are then used to compute the quantum Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds on the estimations at hand. Further, we compare such ultimate bounds to the classical Fisher information of local polarisation or helicity degrees of freedom.</description>
