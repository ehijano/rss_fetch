      <title>Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.</description>

      <title>Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the model\'s ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. We investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is scale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with contamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\%$ to $16\%$ ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, an accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead to slightly weaker constraints on $\sum m_\nu$.</description>

      <title>The degeneracy between microlensing wave effect and precession in strongly lensed gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing induced by the stellar field within a strong lensing galaxy can introduce fluctuations in the waveforms of strongly-lensed gravitational waves.When fitting these signals with templates that do not account for microlensing,possible degeneracies can lead to false evidence of certain intrinsic parameters,resulting in a misinterpretation of the properties of the underlying system.For example,the wave effect of microlensing may mimic spin precessions,as both effects generically induce periodic waveform modulations.Although previous studies suggest that lensing-induced modulations can be distinguished from precession using parameter estimation under a geometric-optic approximation,it does not directly apply for lensed image through stellar fields due to large number of stars involved an wave-optic effects.This study aims to evaluate the degree of degeneracy between the stellar-field microlensing and spin precession,investigating whether microlensing leads false evidence of precession.In other words,to what extent observed SLGWs are identified with false evidence of precession.The main findings are as follows.First,assuming O5 sensitivity and parallel spins for the underlying binary black holes,microlensing-induced false evidence of precession is generally weak(15% of the events show significant evidence,30% if the signal-to-noise ratio doubles).Second,for highly magnified events,about 72% of the population show significant evidence of precession,which could serve as an identification criterion for microlensing.This implies the possibility of strong lensing for the recent event GW231123,which is in the mass gap and also shows evidence of precession.Finally,a moderate to strong positive correlation exists between microlensing strength and precession evidence,more pronounced in Type II SLGWs.This suggests that stronger precession evidence may imply a stronger microlensing effect.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory: Fast Computation and Comparison with Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation, capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor, accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees with emulator predictions at the 2--3\% level up to \( k \simeq 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in galaxy surveys. The numerical implementation developed in this work is publicly released as the open-source Python package \texttt{ulptkit} (https://github.com/naonori/ulptkit).</description>

      <title>Mixed Dark Matter and Galaxy Clustering: The Importance of Relative Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative model to describe large-scale structure in cosmologies where dark matter consists of a mixture of cold (CDM) and warm (WDM) components. In such mixed dark matter (MDM) scenarios, even a subdominant warm component can introduce distinctive signatures via its free-streaming effects, altering the evolution of density and velocity perturbations. We present linear-order solutions for both total and relative perturbations in the two-fluid system, identifying novel contributions to galaxy bias caused by the relative density and velocity modes between the components. Incorporating these effects into the galaxy bias expansion, we compute the linear galaxy power spectrum in both real and redshift space. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we assess the sensitivity of upcoming surveys such as DESI and PFS to MDM scenarios. Our results demonstrate that neglecting relative perturbations can lead to significant biases in inferred constraints on the warm dark matter fraction, particularly for lighter WDM masses ($\lesssim 150~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\lesssim 80~\mathrm{eV}$) for PFS and DESI, respectively. This framework provides a consistent and generalizable approach for incorporating multi-component dark matter dynamics into galaxy clustering analyses.</description>

      <title>Hyper Suprime-Cam Y3 results: photo-$z$ bias calibration with lensing shear ratios and cosmological constraints from cosmic shea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an independent calibration of the photometric redshift (photo-$z$) distributions for source galaxies in the HSC-Y3 weak lensing survey using small-scale galaxy-galaxy lensing. By measuring the tangential shear around spectroscopic lens galaxies from GAMA, SDSS, and DESI, divided into fifteen narrow redshift bins, we compute shear ratios that are sensitive to the mean redshift of source galaxies. Using a blinded analysis, we derive constraints on the photo-$z$ bias parameters in source bins 2, 3 and 4, achieving signal-to-noise ratios of 59, 75, and 62, respectively. Our constraints for $\Delta z_2$, $\Delta z_3$ and $\Delta z_4$ are consistent with those from HSC-Y3 cosmic shear modeling. We observe a mild shift in the $\Delta z_3$-$\Delta z_4$ plane due to the heterogeneous depth of the lens sample, which disappears when using only DESI-DR1 lenses. Combining shear-ratio measurements with cosmic shear data, we obtain joint constraints on cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.286_{-0.074}^{+0.038}$ and $S_8 = 0.760_{-0.145}^{+0.044}$, consistent with cosmic shear-only results. This work demonstrates the utility of small-scale lensing as an independent probe for calibrating photometric redshift bias in weak lensing cosmology.</description>

      <title>Inferring local quasar IGM damping wing constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars are a highly sensitive probe of the neutral hydrogen (HI) content in the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM), not only constraining the global timing of reionization but also the \textit{local} ionization topology near the quasar. Near-optimal extraction of this information is possible with the help of two recently introduced reionization model-independent summary statistics of the HI distribution in the IGM \textit{before} the quasar started shining, complemented with the quasar's lifetime encoding the effect of its ionizing radiation as a third parameter. We introduce a fully Bayesian JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework that allows us to jointly reconstruct the quasar's unknown continuum and constrain these local damping wing statistics. We put forward a probabilistic framework that allows us to tie these local constraints to any specific reionization model and obtain model-dependent constraints on the global timing of reionization. We demonstrate that we are able to constrain the (Lorentzian-weighted) HI column density in front of the quasar to a precision of $0.69_{-0.30}^{+0.06}\,\mathrm{dex}$ and its original distance to the first neutral patch before the quasar started shining to $31.4_{-28.1}^{+10.7}\,\mathrm{cMpc}$ (if a noticeable damping wing is present in the spectrum), extracting hitherto unused local information from the IGM damping wing imprint. Once tied to a specific reionization model, we find that the statistical fidelity of our constraints on the global IGM neutral fraction and the lifetime of the quasar improves, while retaining the same precision as achieved by pipelines that infer these parameters directly.</description>

      <title>First constraints on the local ionization topology in front of two quasars at z ~ 7.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thus far, Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars have been used to probe the \textit{global} ionization state of the foreground intergalactic medium (IGM). A new parameterization has demonstrated that the damping wing signature also carries \textit{local} information about the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) in front of the quasar before it started shining. Leveraging a recently introduced Bayesian \texttt{JAX}-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) inference framework, we derive constraints on the Lorentzian-weighted HI column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$, the quasar's distance $r_\mathrm{patch}$ to the first neutral patch and its lifetime $t_\mathrm{Q}$ based on JWST/NIRSpec spectra of the two $z \sim 7.5$ quasars J1007+2115 and J1342+0928. After folding in model-dependent topology information, we find that J1007+2115 (and J1342+0928) is most likely to reside in a $\langle x_\mathrm{HI} \rangle = 0.32_{-0.20}^{+0.22}$ ($0.58_{-0.23}^{+0.23}$) neutral IGM while shining for a remarkably short lifetime of $\log_{10} t_\mathrm{Q} /\mathrm{yr} = 4.14_{-0.18}^{+0.74}$ (an intermediate lifetime of $5.64_{-0.43}^{+0.25}$) along a sightline with $\log_{10} N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW} /\mathrm{cm}^{-2} = 19.70_{-0.86}^{+0.35}$ ($20.24_{-0.22}^{+0.25}$) and $r_\mathrm{patch} = 28.9_{-14.4}^{+54.0} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$ ($10.9_{-5.9}^{+5.6} \,\mathrm{cMpc}$). In light of the potential presence of local absorbers in the foreground of J1342+0928 as has been recently suggested, we also demonstrate how the Lorentzian-weighted column density $N_\mathrm{HI}^\mathrm{DW}$ provides a natural means for quantifying their contribution to the observed damping wing signal.</description>

      <title>Interact or Twist: Cosmological Correlators from Field Redefinitions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, correlation functions on a late-time boundary can arise from both field redefinitions and bulk interactions, which are usually believed to generate distinct results. In this letter, we propose a counterexample showcasing that correlators from local field redefinitions can be identical to the ones from bulk interactions. In particular, we consider a two-field model in de Sitter space, where the field space gets twisted by field redefinitions to yield a nontrivial reheating surface. We then exploit conformal symmetry to compute the three-point function, and show that the result takes the form of contact correlators with a total-energy singularity. Our finding suggests that in the effective field theory, a class of lower-dimensional operators, which were overlooked previously, may lead to nontrivial signals in cosmological correlators. As an illustration, we apply our result to cosmic inflation and derive a possibly leading signature of the Higgs in the primordial bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington accretion in protogalactic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z &gt; 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.</description>

      <title>Pion dark matter in a $\theta$ vacuum: a thermal relic with sharp velocity-dependent self-interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As recently proposed, a non-vanishing topological angle may play a central role in QCD-like theories of dark matter (DM). In this work, we introduce a dark photon portal to the Standard Model in order to establish thermal equilibrium in the early Universe, and discuss the ensuing phenomenological constraints, including the stability of DM. The resulting dynamics accounts for the observed DM relic abundance and yields velocity-dependent DM self-interactions in astrophysical halos. Due to the sharp velocity dependence arising from a Breit-Wigner resonance, dedicated studies are required to assess the gravothermal evolution in detail, especially in the core-collapse regime. This is particularly timely in light of self-interacting DM interpretations of strong-lensing systems such as SDSS J0946+1006, which can be naturally explained within our framework.</description>

Abstract: We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 50, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The two largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>How does feedback affect the star formation histories of galaxies?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the interplay of a range of processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding, accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel, complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.</description>

      <title>The Bigfoot: A footprint of a Coma cluster progenitor at z=3.98</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoclusters, galaxy clusters' high redshift progenitors, hold the keys to understanding the formation and evolution of clusters and their member galaxies. However, their cosmological distances and spatial extensions (tens of Mpc) have inhibited complete mapping of their structure and constituent galaxies, which is key to robustly linking protoclusters to their descendants. Here we report the discovery of the Bigfoot, a tridimensional structure at $z = 3.98$ including 11 subgroups traced by 55 (700) spectroscopic (photometric) redshifts with JWST, extending over $15\times 37$ $\times 49{\rm{cMpc^3}}$ in the PRIMER-UDS field. Bigfoot's large-scale and mass function of member galaxies closely match constrained simulations' predictions for the progenitors of today's most massive clusters (${M_0} &gt; 10^{15} {M_{_ \odot }}$). All subgroups with ${M_{\rm{h}}} &gt; {10^{12.5}}{M_{_ \odot }}$ exhibit enhanced fractions of massive galaxies ($&gt;{10^{10.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) compared to lower-mass halos and the field, demonstrating the accelerated formation of massive galaxies in massive halos. The presence of this massive protocluster with a large central halo (${10^{13.0} {M_{_ \odot }}}$) in a JWST deep field bears important cosmological implication that favors high ${\sigma _8}$ of PLANCK cosmology over low-redshift probes.</description>

      <title>Lensing Stability and Scattering Phenomena in Anisotropic Black Hole Spacetimes in Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Mounds: towards a realistic description of dark matter overdensities around black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter overdensities around black holes can be searched for by looking at the characteristic imprint they leave on the gravitational waveform of binary black hole mergers. Current theoretical predictions of the density profile of dark matter overdensities are based on highly idealised formation scenarios, in which black holes are assumed to grow adiabatically from an infinitesimal seed to their final mass, compressing dark matter cusps at the center of galactic halos into very dense `spikes'. These scenarios were suitable for dark matter indirect detection studies, since annihilating dark matter cannot reach very high densities, but they fail to capture the dark matter distribution in the innermost regions where the gravitational wave signal is produced. We present here a more realistic formation scenario where black holes form from the collapse of supermassive stars, and follow the evolution of the dark matter density as the supermassive star grows and collapses to a black hole. We show that in this case dark matter forms shallower `mounds', instead of `spikes', on scales comparable with the size of the supermassive stars originating them. We discuss the implications for the detectability of these systems.</description>

      <title>Deep learning approach for identification of HII regions during reionization in 21-cm observations -- III. image recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low-frequency component of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKA-Low) will be sensitive enough to construct 3D tomographic images of the 21-cm signal distribution during reionisation. However, foreground contamination poses challenges for detecting this signal, and image recovery will heavily rely on effective mitigation methods. We introduce \texttt{SERENEt}, a deep-learning framework designed to recover the 21-cm signal from SKA-Low's foreground-contaminated observations, enabling the detection of ionised (HII) and neutral (HI) regions during reionisation. \texttt{SERENEt} can recover the signal distribution with an average accuracy of 75 per cent at the early stages ($\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}\simeq0.9$) and up to 90 per cent at the late stages of reionisation ($\overline{x}_\mathrm{HI}\simeq0.1$). Conversely, HI region detection starts at 92 per cent accuracy, decreasing to 73 per cent as reionisation progresses. Beyond improving image recovery, \texttt{SERENEt} provides cylindrical power spectra with an average accuracy exceeding 93 per cent throughout the reionisation period. We tested \texttt{SERENEt} on a 10-degree field-of-view simulation, consistently achieving better and more stable results when prior maps were provided. Notably, including prior information about HII region locations improved 21-cm signal recovery by approximately 10 per cent. This capability was demonstrated by supplying \texttt{SERENEt} with ionising source distribution measurements, showing that high-redshift galaxy surveys of similar observation fields can optimise foreground mitigation and enhance 21-cm image construction.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the dispersion measure of Fast Radio Burst host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is sensitive to the electron distribution in the Universe, making it a promising probe of cosmology and astrophysical processes such as baryonic feedback. However, cosmological analyses of FRBs require knowledge of the contribution to the observed DM coming from the FRB host. The size and distribution of this contribution is still uncertain, thus significantly limiting current cosmological FRB analyses. In this study, we extend the baryonification (BCM) approach to derive a physically-motivated, analytic model for predicting the host contribution to FRB DMs. By focusing on the statistical properties of FRB host DMs, we find that our simple model is able to reproduce the probability distribution function (PDF) of host halo DMs measured from the CAMELS suite of hydrodynamic simulations, as well as their mass- and redshift dependence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model allows for self-consistent predictions of the host DM PDF and the matter power spectrum suppression due to baryonic effects, as observed in these simulations, making it promising for modelling host-DM-related systematics in FRB analyses. In general, we find that the shape of the host DM PDF is determined by the interplay between the FRB and gas distributions in halos. Our findings indicate that more compact FRB profiles require shallower gas profiles (and vice versa) in order to match the observed DM distributions in hydrodynamic simulations. Furthermore, the analytic model presented here shows that the shape of the host DM PDF is highly sensitive to the parameters of the BCM. This suggests that this observable could be used as an interesting test bed for baryonic processes, complementing other probes due to its sensitivity to feedback on galactic scales. We further discuss the main limitations of our analysis, and point out potential avenues for future work.</description>

Abstract: The first year results of DESI (DR1) provide evidence that dark energy may not be quantum vacuum energy ($\Lambda$). If true, this would be an extraordinary development in the 25-year quest to understand cosmic acceleration. The best-fit DESI $w_0w_a$ models for dark energy, which underpin the claim, have strange behavior. They achieve a maximum energy density around $z\simeq 0.5 $ and rapidly decrease before and after. We explore physics-based models where the dark energy is a rolling scalar-field. Our four scalar-field models are characterized by one dimensionless parameter $\beta$, which in the limit of $\beta \rightarrow 0$ reduces to $\Lambda$CDM. While none of our models fit the DESI data significantly better than $\Lambda$CDM, for values of $\beta$ of order unity, they fit about as well as $\Lambda$CDM. Alternatives to vacuum energy make different predictions for the age of the Universe and are potential discriminators. We also consider the second data release from DESI (DR2), CMB data and supernovae data. The DR2 results are consistent with the DR1, and the combination of DESI, CMB and SNe favor a 95\% credible interval $\beta = 0.22 - 0.95$, providing modest evidence for a scalar-field explanation for dark energy. While the DESI data prefer $w_0w_a$ to a scalar field, the SNe data prefer a scalar field to $w_0w_a$. The robust DESI preference for sharply-peaked dark energy may be telling us something important about dark energy or the DESI data themselves.</description>

Abstract: Any attempt to understand the ubiquitous nature of the magnetic field in the present universe seems to lead us towards its primordial origin. For large-scale magnetic fields, however, their strength and length scale may not necessarily originate from a singular primordial mechanism, namely inflationary magnetogenesis, which has been a popular consideration in the literature. In this paper, we propose a minimal scenario wherein a large-scale magnetic field is generated from the inflationary perturbation without any non-conformal coupling. Due to their origin in the inflationary scalar spectrum, these primordial fields are inherently weak, with their strength suppressed by the small amplitude of scalar fluctuations. We then consider the coupling between this large-scale weak primordial magnetic field and a light axion of mass $&lt;10^{-28}$ eV, which is assumed to be frozen in a misaligned state until the photon decoupling. After the decoupling, when the universe enters into a dark age, the light axion coherently oscillates. By appropriately tuning the axion-photon coupling parameter $\alpha$, we demonstrate that a large-scale magnetic field of sufficient strength can indeed be generated through tachyonic resonance. We further show that the produced magnetic field induces a unique spectrum with multiple peaks of secondary gravitational waves, which the upcoming CMB-S4 can probe through B-mode polarization. The strength can be sufficient enough to violate the PLANCK bound on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.036$. Such a violation leads to a constraint on $\alpha \lesssim 80$. With this limiting value of the coupling, we find that present-day magnetic field strength could be as high as $10^{-10}$ Gauss at Mpc scale, consistent with observation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO-Virgo and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened a new window into early universe cosmology. Yet, the origin of large-scale magnetic fields and the dynamics of the reheating epoch remain poorly understood. In this work, we study the generation of secondary GWs (SGWs) sourced by primordial magnetic fields produced via a Sawtooth-type coupling during reheating with a general background evolution. We show that the reheating equation of state significantly influences the spectral shape and amplitude of the magnetic fields. While a scale-invariant spectrum is typically needed to match observational bounds, this coupling naturally produces a strongly blue-tilted spectrum that remains consistent with current constraints. Crucially, the magnetic field continues to grow during reheating, leading to a GW signal with a broken power-law spectrum and a distinctive blue tilt on super-horizon scales. This SGW signal can fall within the sensitivity of upcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. The unique spectral features make this scenario distinguishable from other sources, offering a viable mechanism for cosmic magnetogenesis and a novel probe of the reheating era through GW observations.</description>

Abstract: We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) microwave sky maps covering 16293 square degrees in three frequency bands, using data obtained over the lifetime of the project (2008-2022). We report redshifts and mass estimates for 10040 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect with signal-to-noise greater than 4 at a 2.4 arcminute filter scale. The catalog includes 1171 clusters at redshifts greater than 1, and 123 clusters at redshifts greater than 1.5. Using a relation between cluster SZ signal and mass that is consistent with recent weak-lensing measurements, we estimate that clusters detected with signal-to-noise greater than 5 form a sample which is 90% complete for clusters with masses greater than $5 \times 10^{14}$ MSun (measured within a spherical volume with mean density 500 times the critical density). El Gordo, a cluster found in an initial ACT survey of 755 square degrees, remains the most extreme cluster in mass and redshift; we find no cluster with a mass and redshift combination high enough to falsify the standard LCDM cosmology with Gaussian initial perturbations. We make public a variety of data products, including the full cluster candidate list, noise maps, and sky masks, along with our software for cluster detection and instructions for reproducing our cluster catalogs from the public ACT maps.</description>

      <title>Does DESI DR2 challenge $\Lambda$CDM paradigm ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although debate on DESI DR1 systematics remains, DESI DR2 is consistent with DR1 and strengthens its trends. In our analysis, the LRG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.510$ and the LRG3+ELG1 point at $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.934$ are in tension with the $\Lambda$CDM-anchored $\Omega_m$ inferred from Planck and SNe Ia (Pantheon$^{+}$, Union3, DES-SN5YR): for LRG1 the tensions are $2.42\sigma$, $1.91\sigma$, $2.19\sigma$, and $2.99\sigma$; for LRG3+ELG1 they are $2.60\sigma$, $2.24\sigma$, $2.51\sigma$, and $2.96\sigma$. Across redshift bins DR2 shows improved agreement relative to DR1, with the $\Omega_m$ tension dropping from $2.20\sigma$ to $1.84\sigma$. Nevertheless, DR2 alone is not decisive against $\Lambda$CDM, and the apparent deviation is driven mainly by LRG1 and LRG2. In a $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM fit using all tracers we find a posterior mean with $w_0&gt;-1$, consistent with dynamical dark energy and nominally challenging $\Lambda$CDM. Removing LRG1 and/or LRG2 restores $\Lambda$CDM concordance ($\omega_0\to-1$); moreover, $\omega_0^{\mathrm{(LRG2)}}&gt;w_0^{\mathrm{(LRG1)}}$, indicating that LRG2 drives the trend more strongly. Model selection via the natural-log Bayes factor $\ln\mathrm{BF}\equiv\ln(Z_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}/Z_{\omega_0\omega_a\mathrm{CDM}})$ yields weak evidence for $\Lambda$CDM when LRG1, LRG2, or both are removed, and is inconclusive for the full sample. Hence the data do not require the extra $\omega_a$ freedom, and the apparent $\omega_0&gt;-1$ preference should be interpreted cautiously as a reflection of the $\omega_0$$\omega_a$ degeneracy with limited per-tracer information.</description>

      <title>Calculating the power spectrum in stochastic inflation by Monte Carlo simulation and least squares curve fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.</description>

      <title>Effective theory of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter with observable ${\Delta N_{\rm eff}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of light Dirac neutrino portal dark matter (DM) in an effective field theory setup. Dirac nature of light neutrino automatically includes its right chiral part $\nu_R$ which, in our setup, also acts like a portal between DM and the standard model (SM) particles. Considering a Dirac fermion singlet DM stabilized by an unbroken $Z_2$ symmetry, we write down all possible dimension-6 effective operators involving DM-$\nu_R$ as well as $\nu_R$-SM which conserve $Z_2$, global lepton number and SM gauge symmetries. DM thermalization also ensures the thermalization of $\nu_R$, leading to enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We study the complementarity among DM and CMB related observations for different Lorentz structures of effective operators. We also propose a UV complete gauged $\rm B-L$ symmetric model with Dirac neutrino portal dark matter.</description>

      <title>Universal Density and Velocity Distributions of Dark Matter around Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of dark matter at the galactic center, crucial for indirect searches, remains uncertain. In particular, in the vicinity of the massive black hole in the center of a galaxy where indirect signals may be stronger, the density of a dark matter spike may undergo redistribution. Here we calculate the density surrounding Schwarzschild black holes that originate from diverse initial dark halos and estimate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. By employing a series of Hernquist and power-law initial dark halos, we obtain a fitting formula between dark matter spikes and black hole masses. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is utilized to approximate the velocity distribution of dark matter particles. As an application, taking into account dark matter self-annihilation, we assess the relic densities of dark matter spikes around black holes. We find that the relic spikes for s-wave annihilation are higher than p-wave annihilation, and the relic densities obtained for p-wave annihilation depend on the velocity distribution, varying significantly with distance. The findings shall further provide useful insights for multi-messenger dark matter detections in the future.</description>

      <title>The Science of the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is the European project for a gravitational-wave (GW) observatory of third-generation. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Warm multi natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-natural inflation is studied in the context of warm inflation. We study the warm multi-natural inflation scenario with both linear and cubic temperature-dependent dissipation coefficients. The model is motivated by axion-like inflation models with coupling to non-Abelian gauge fields through a dimension-five coupling and dissipation originating from sphaleron decay in a thermal bath. Both cases of dissipation coefficients can be compatible with current observations. In the case of the cubic dissipation coefficient, we find that the curvature perturbation starts to grow suddenly when a transition from a weak dissipation to a strong dissipation regime occurs at the later stage of the inflation. We also show that such rapid growth of the curvature perturbation on small scales gives rise to abundant scalar induced gravitational waves, which may be detectable with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and ET. On the other hand, there are also other parameter regions of the model, in the warm inflation regime of weak to strong dissipation and with sub-Planckian axion decay constant, that can lead to overproduction of primordial black holes on small scales, which are constrained by nucleosynthesis bounds, thus ruling out the model in this region of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a brief review of the basic principles of inflationary theory and discuss the present status of the simplest inflationary models that can describe Planck/BICEP/Keck observational data by choice of a single model parameter. In particular, we discuss the Starobinsky model, Higgs inflation, and $\alpha$-attractors, including the recently developed $\alpha$-attractor models with $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We also describe inflationary models providing a good fit to the recent ACT data, as well as the polynomial chaotic inflation models with three parameters, which can account for any values of the three main CMB-related inflationary parameters $A_{s}$, $n_{s}$ and $r$.</description>

      <title>Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description>

Abstract: The scotogenic model provides a minimal and elegant framework that simultaneously explains neutrino masses and accommodates a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic DM in the scotogenic model, with a particular emphasis on the effects of a non-standard cosmological history characterized by a low reheating temperature. We demonstrate that entropy injection from inflaton decay can significantly dilute the DM abundance, thereby relaxing the annihilation cross section required to reproduce the observed relic density and opening new regions of viable parameter space. We further analyze the complementarity between current and future direct detection experiments and charged lepton flavour violation (cLFV) searches in probing this scenario. Our results show that next-generation direct detection experiments such as DARWIN and XLZD, together with upcoming cLFV searches (in particular the future sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow 3e$ experiments), will be capable of testing substantial regions of the parameter space, including those associated with low reheating temperatures.</description>
