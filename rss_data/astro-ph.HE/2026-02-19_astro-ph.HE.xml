      <title>Foiling Black Hole Foils: Revealing Horizon Alternatives with Baryonic Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event horizons are a defining feature of black holes. Consequently, there have been many efforts to probe their existence in astrophysical black hole candidates, spanning ten orders of magnitude in mass. Nevertheless, horizons remain an obstacle to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, most sharply presented by the information paradox. This has motivated a proliferation of horizonless alternatives (black hole foils) that avoid event horizons and are therefore benign. We show that for typical accreting astronomical targets, largely independent of a foil's underlying microphysics, a horizonless compact surface will generically be ensconced within an optically thick, scattering dominated baryonic settling layer that efficiently reprocesses the kinetic energy of infalling matter into observable thermal emission. The emergent photosphere luminosity is driven toward the accretion-powered equilibrium value and is only weakly sensitive to the foil redshift. These atmospheres are convectively stable and naturally imply that the emitting photosphere forms at modest redshift even when the surface redshift is extreme. Moreover, local gas-surface interaction provides a microphysical lower bound on the effective base temperature, insulating the atmosphere from arbitrarily cold foils. The unknown properties of the foil enter only through local boundary conditions controlling baryon processing and thermal coupling at the surface, making the solutions broadly applicable to horizonless alternatives that do not invoke significant additional nonlocal interactions. Thus, under minimal assumptions (GR exterior and local surface interactions), horizonless foils are generically observationally exposed: the absence of a thermal photosphere directly constrains or rules out broad classes of such models.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes swallow stellar objects at high rates: from Little Red Dots to Black Hole Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Spectra and Metal Budget Regulated by the Galactic Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the advection effect of the Galactic wind on the local cosmic ray spectra. The spectral hardening from a few hundred GV and softening from a few TV are reproduced by a velocity profile with a maximum velocity of $\sim 700~\mbox{km}~ \mbox{s}^{-1}$ without introducing a break in the power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient. Additionally, we find that a hard CR spectrum below $\sim$ TV with an index of $\sim 2$ at an altitude $\sim 3$-$5$ kpc from the Galactic disk. This hard spectrum is favorable for the gamma-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles. With the obtained CR fluxes, we discuss the matter circulation in our Galaxy with the wind. While the wind has an essential role in maintaining the metal abundance in the disk, the production rate of Beryllium, which originates from CR spallation, is so low that the ratio Be/O in the halo should be larger than that in the disk gas.</description>

      <title>The Enigmatic Type Icn Supernova 2024abvb Located ~22 kpc from Its Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report multiwavelength observations of the highly offset (~22.4 kpc) SN 2024abvb, the sixth Type Icn supernova to date. With a peak magnitude of Mr = -19.55 +/- 0.11 mag, it is among the most luminous in the existing sample and shows similar colours and decline rates to other SNe Icn. The early optical spectra show a blue continuum with narrow C II features (vFWHM ~ 2000 km s^-1), consistent with a typical wind velocity of a Wolf-Rayet star. The absence of C III lambda 5696 emission at the time of explosion is consistent with a Type Ibn supernova; however, the lack of narrow He lines in both the optical and near-infrared spectra supports a SNe Icn classification. Unlike the majority of SNe Icn, we do not detect broad features in the late-time (7-21 days relative to o-band peak) spectral phase of SN 2024abvb. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curves shows that it can be reproduced by ~2.6 Msun of SN ejecta interacting with ~0.3 Msun of circumstellar material (CSM), both larger than other SNe Icn but consistent with rapidly evolving SNe Ibn. The metallicity at the SN location is significantly lower than the global metallicity of its host galaxy, suggesting that line-driven mass loss required to strip the progenitor of its H and He envelopes was likely inefficient. We estimate the star-formation-rate history at the location of SN 2024abvb and find that it lies at the bottom ~5th percentile among SESNe hosts, inconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Based on its spectral features, local and host environment properties, and host-galaxy offset, we favour an 8-10 Msun star stripped by a compact companion as the progenitor, with a sufficient runaway velocity to reach the observed offset.</description>

      <title>A XRISM View of the Iron Line Complex in NGC 1068: Rethinking the Prototypical Compton-Thick AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze an XRISM/Resolve observation of NGC1068, focusing on the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ fluorescent lines and on the Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission complexes. Line centroid energies, intrinsic widths, flux ratios, and constraints on the Compton shoulder are derived through local spectral fitting, and compared with atomic calculations and theoretical predictions. The centroid energies of the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ lines tightly constrain the emitting material to be neutral or near-neutral. The observed Fe K$\beta$/K$\alpha$ ratio, together with the stringent upper limit on the Compton shoulder ($\lesssim$8--11% of the core flux), disfavour reflection dominated by a homogeneous, classical Compton-thick medium, indicating that most of the neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission arises in optically thin or moderately Compton-thick gas. The Fe XXV and Fe XXVI emission lines exhibit remarkably large velocity widths, of several thousand km~s$^{-1}$. These broad profiles closely resemble the integrated optical and infrared [O III] and [O IV] lines associated with the large-scale biconical outflow, and are naturally interpreted as the X-ray signature of a more highly ionized, faster, and more spatially confined phase of the same outflow. The iron-K emission of NGC1068 reveals a stratified circumnuclear environment in which neutral and highly ionized components arise in physically distinct regions. The neutral Fe K fluorescence originates predominantly in optically thin or mildly Compton-thick material, despite the persistently Compton-thick line-of-sight obscuration, indicating a geometrically complex cold reprocessor. The highly ionized iron emission lines trace a fast component consistent with a warm bipolar outflow on parsec scales, whose large velocities and inferred energetics suggest that it may represent an efficient channel for feedback in a heavily obscured Seyfert galaxy.</description>

      <title>A fast radio burst cyclone in technicolour: evidence of plasma lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, energetic, radio pulses of extragalactic origin. A dichotomy has emerged in the population: some produce repeat bursts, while the majority do not. Most repeating sources only show rare repetitions, and none have been studied extensively over the wide bandwidths necessary to disentangle the physical processes that produce emission from distortions to bursts caused by intervening ionised gas. Here we present radio observations of the most active repeating source, FRB 20240114A. Using an ultrawideband receiving system, we have detected 5526 repetitions, revealing an extreme spectral and temporal variability in the burst emission. The bursts exhibit longer-term broadband variations in central emission frequency over multiple months, and narrowband bursts that have correlations in central frequencies on time scales of milliseconds to minutes. The spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the source undergoing magnification by foreground plasma lenses, potentially embedded in a turbulent circumsource medium. This extreme example highlights the role of plasma lenses in the observed properties of burst emission and can explain the diversity in activity and energetics of the entire FRB population.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Multiple Component Outflows in PG 1211+143: II. The Soft X-ray View of the Ultra Fast Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby quasar, PG 1211+143, has one of the prototype examples of an ultra fast outflow (UFO), as seen in several past XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. In December 2024, PG 1211+143 was observed simultaneously with XRISM Resolve and XMM-Newton, allowing both the Fe K and soft X-ray outflows to be examined at high resolution simultaneously. The Resolve spectrum revealed a forest of Fe K band absorption lines from the UFO (Mizumoto et al. 2026), comprising of up to six discrete velocity components ranging from $v/c=-0.074$ to $v/c=-0.40$. Here we present the simultaneous XMM-Newton RGS (Reflection Grating Spectrometer) spectrum, where three lower ionization counterparts of the Fe K velocity zones are observed; at $v/c=-0.074, -0.12$ and $-0.33$. The soft X-ray absorbers tend to be somewhat less ionized than their Fe K counterparts, with their opacity mainly arising from Fe L shell lines and highly ionized Oxygen. From comparing the Resolve and RGS absorbers, we show that the outflow can be parameterized with a density profile varying with radius as $r^{-5/3}$, while the lower ionization zones likely originate from denser clumps of gas. Pure electron scattering appears insufficient to provide enough thrust to power the wind, unless sufficient low ionization gas capable of radiative line driving exists outside of the line of sight. Overall, PG 1211+143 provides further evidence for the clumpy nature of accretion disk winds, as was recently revealed in the quasar PDS 456 with XRISM.</description>

      <title>GOTO identification and broadband modelling of the counterpart to the SVOM GRB 250818B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid localisation and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) increasingly rely on low-latency triggers from new missions coupled to wide-field robotic optical facilities. We present the discovery and multi-wavelength follow-up of GRB 250818B, detected by the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) and localised optically by the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO). We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \sim 4\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $\theta_j \simeq 0.10$ rad ($\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \simeq 1.64$. The host association is ambiguous: the nearest LS DR10 galaxy candidate ($r_{AB} \sim 24.7$) is offset by $\sim 4$ arcsec ($\sim 34$ kpc) with chance-alignment probability $P_{cc} \sim 0.2$, and current imaging does not exclude a fainter, near-coincident host. SED fitting of the candidate host suggests a low-mass galaxy. GRB 250818B highlights the power of rapid wide-field counterpart identification in the SVOM era, while host-association uncertainty can still limit offset-based interpretation.</description>

      <title>Implications of the nanoHertz Gravitational-Wave Background for Galactic Feedback and Massive Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements of the nanoHertz gravitational-wave background (GWB) can constrain models for the growth history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and how active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback models can affect GWB predictions. Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population.</description>

      <title>Particle-in-Cell Methods for Simulations of Sheared, Expanding, or Escaping Astrophysical Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods have achieved widespread recognition as simple and flexible approaches to model collisionless plasma physics in fully kinetic simulations of astrophysical environments. However, in many situations the standard PIC algorithm must be extended to include macroscopic effects in microscale simulations. For plasmas subjected to shearing or expansion, shearing-box and expanding-box methods can be incorporated into PIC to account for these global effects. For plasmas subjected to local acceleration in confined regions of space, a leaky-box method can allow closed-box PIC simulations to account for particle escape from the accelerator region. In this work, we review and improve methods to include shearing, expansion, and escape in PIC simulations. We provide the numerical details of how Maxwell's equations and the particle equations of motion are solved in each case, and introduce generalized Boris-like particle pushers to solve the momentum equation in the presence of extra forces. This work is intended to serve as a comprehensive reference for the implementation of shearing-box, expanding-box, and leaky-box algorithms in PIC.</description>

      <title>New formula for Asymptotic behavior of the Synchrotron function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation plays a central role in astrophysical and high-energy processes. Its spectral description involves the synchrotron function, defined by a non-trivial integral of modified Bessel functions and commonly evaluated through numerical methods or dedicated approximations. In this work, we obtain a compact analytical representation of the synchrotron function using the Method of Brackets, which yields systematically controllable asymptotic expansions in both the small- and large-argument regimes. The resulting expressions accurately reproduce numerical integration and make the analytic structure of the function explicit. Our results provide an efficient alternative to repeated numerical evaluations and facilitate applications requiring fast and controlled approximations.</description>

      <title>The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey: VII. Third Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the third data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR3). The survey images cover 88% of the northern sky and were created from 12,950 hrs of data (18.6 PB) accumulated over 10.5 years. The images were produced through direction-independent and direction-dependent calibration pipelines that correct for instrumental effects as well as spatially and temporally varying ionospheric distortions. In our 120-168 MHz continuum mosaic images with an angular resolution of 6 arcsec (9 arcsec below declination 10$^\circ$) we catalogue 13,667,877 sources, formed from 16,943,656 Gaussian components. The scatter in the astrometric precision approximately follows the expected noise-like behaviour but with an additional systematic component of at least 0.24 arcsec that is likely due to calibration imperfections. The random flux density scale error is 6%, while the systematic offset was previously shown to be within 2%. The median sensitivity of our mosaics is 92$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Completeness simulations, accounting for realistic source models, time- and bandwidth-smearing effects, and astrometric errors, indicate that we detect more than 95% of compact sources with integrated flux densities exceeding 9 times the local root mean square (RMS) noise. However, the recovered source counts in a particular integrated flux density bin do not match the injected counts until flux densities exceed 45 times the local RMS noise. The Euclidean-normalised differential source counts derived from the survey constrain the radio source population over five orders of magnitude and are in good agreement with previous deep and wide-area surveys. All data products are publicly available, including catalogues, individual-field Stokes I, Q, U, and V images, mosaicked Stokes I images, and $uv$ data with associated direction-dependent calibration solutions.</description>

      <title>Gas Accretion versus BH Merger driven Growth Modes of Supermassive Black Holes and Implications for the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of central supermassive black holes in galaxies, aiming to distinguish between gas accretion versus BH merger-driven growth modes. By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion.</description>

      <title>Solving BDNK diffusion using physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reformulate the relativistic BDNK (Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun) diffusion equation in flux-conservative form, and solve the resulting equations in $(1+1)$D using both a second-order Kurganov-Tadmor finite volume scheme and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In particular, we introduce the SA-PINN-ACTO framework, which combines the self-adaptive PINN technique with an exact enforcement of initial and periodic boundary conditions through an algebraic transform of the network's raw output, allowing the network to focus solely on minimizing the PDE residual. We test both approaches on smooth and discontinuous initial data, for both trivial and dynamically evolving velocity and temperature BDNK backgrounds, and for two characteristic speeds. The SA-PINN-ACTO method matches the converged Kurganov-Tadmor solutions for smooth profiles, while for discontinuous profiles the errors increase, reflecting an expected limitation of PINNs near sharp gradients.</description>

      <title>Prompt And Delayed Radio Bangs At Kilohertz By SN 1987A: A Test For Graviton-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9604047</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9604047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   A sequence of prompt and delayed radio signals at tens of kilohertz should reach the Earth (or Jupiter) due to graviton--photon conversion in interstellar as well as local planetary magnetic fields. These radio fluxes may be a detectable probe of a huge gravitational burst expected from Supernovae explosions. The earliest prompt radio signal, coinciding with the neutrino burst, is due to conversion in the terrestrial (or Jovian) magnetic field and is below the micro-Jansky (or milli-Jansky) level for a galactic Supernova like SN1987A. A later radio signal, a ``tail'', due to the same graviton - radio wave conversion in random interstellar fields will maintain a relic radio ``noise'' for hundreds or thousands of years and might even be still detectable by a very sensitive network of satellite antennas at the kilohertz band. Exact solutions are presented here for the graviton-photon conversion in a refractive medium, as well as their consequences for high energy supernovae and the 2.726 K background radiation.</description>

      <title>Precessing Gamma Jets in extended and evaporating galactic halo as a source of GRB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9605166</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9605166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) by a relativistic electron beam jet at GeV energies (emitted by a compact object as a NS, BH,...), a NSJ, onto thermal BBR photons (from a nearby stellar companion) may originate a collinear gamma jet (GJ). Due to the binary system interaction the GJ precession would blaze suddenly toward the observer leading to a GRB event. The internal GJ cone structure is ruled by relativistic kinematics into a concentric onion-like sequence of photon rings, the softer in the external boundaries, the harder in the inner cone. The pointing and the crossing of such different GJ photon rings to the detector lead to a GRB hardness spectra evolution nearly corresponding to most observed ones. Moreover expected time integral spectra are also comparable with known GRB spectra. The total energy input of tens of thousands of such NSJ in an extended galactic halo, mainly cosmic rays electrons, should be reflected into the recent observational evidence (COMPTEL) of a diffused relic extended halo. Evidences of such precessing jets are offered by the discover of galactic superluminal sources, recent HH jets, SN1987A outer rings, Hourglass Nebula, planetary Egg Nebula, GROJ1744-28 binary X-rays pulsar.</description>

Abstract:   We considered the Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) of charged particles onto photons whose distribution is a Black Body Radiation (BBR) deriving the exact energy and angular differential distribution in the general case and in its most useful expansions. These results can be successfully applied in high energy accelerators experiments to evaluate the ICS contribution from the thermal photons in the cavity as well as in astrophysics where the ICS of cosmic rays plays a relevant role in a variety of phenomena. In particular we show how our formulae reproduce the ICS energy spectrum recently measured at LEP, how it could be considered a key tool in explaining the Gamma Ray Bursts (GRB) , SGRs energy spectrum. Finally we predicted the presence of a low gamma flux, nearly detectable at hundred of TeV from SNRs SN1006 as well as, at lower energy (tens TeV, due to gamma ray cascading in cosmic BBR), from relic extragalactic highest cosmic rays sources born by jets in AGN,as blazars 3C279,Mrk421,Mrk 501.</description>

      <title>The role of \nu_{\tau} ultrahigh energy astrophysics in Km^3 detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9704205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We show that the expected $ \nu_{\tau} $ signals, by their secondary tau tracks, in Km^3 detectors at highest cosmic ray energy window $ 1.7\cdot 10^{21} eV \gt E_{\tau} \gt 1.6 x 10^{17} eV$, must overcome the corresponding $ \nu_{\mu} $ (or muonic) ones. Indeed, the Lorentz-boosted tau range length grows (linearly) above muon range, for $ E_{\tau} \RAISE 1.6 x 10^8 GeV$ and reaches its maxima extension, $ R_{\tau_{\max}} \simeq 191 km$, at energy $E_{\tau} \simeq 3.8 x 10^9 GeV$. At this peak the tau range is nearly 20 times the corresponding muon range (at the same energy) implying a similar ratio in $ \nu_{\tau} $ over $ \nu_{\mu} $ detectability. This dominance, however may lead (at present most abundant $ \nu_{\tau} $ model fluxes) to just a rare spectacular event a year (if flavor mixing occurs). Lower energetic $ \tau $ and $ \nu_{\tau} $ signals $ (\bar{\nu}_e e\to \bar{\nu}_{\tau} \tau, \nu_{\tau} N\to ...) $ at energy range ($ 10^5 \div 10^7 GeV$) may be more easily observed in km^3 detectors at a rate of a few $ (\bar{\nu}_e e\to \bar{\nu}_{\tau} \tau) $ to tens event $ (\nu_{\tau} N\to \tau + $ anything) a year.</description>

      <title>Can GW231123 have a stellar origin?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+23}_{-18} M_\odot$ and $101^{+22}_{-50} M_\odot$ -- in the range of the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160\,M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90\% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We allow for differential rotation to explore the high-spin regime. In this limit of weak angular momentum transport, we find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing an important correlation between masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.</description>

      <title>Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar -- I. Polarization- and spectrum-dependent structure, and the emergent continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar is simulated numerically in the framework of a three-dimensional (geometrically two-dimensional) model. The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that magnetospheric interactions between merging neutron stars (NSs) generate dual-jetted current outflows, analogous to the Alfv\'{e}n wings observed during planetary interactions in the Solar System. Using 3D relativistic MHD simulations, we model the interaction as a conducting sphere moving through a highly magnetized plasma of the companion's magnetosphere. Unusually, the interaction operates in a regime that is relativistic yet sub-Alfv\'{e}nic. Electromagnetic draping amplifies magnetic fields in a narrow layer near the stellar surface, leading to the generation of electric currents along the local magnetic field. The generation of beamed outflows enhances the instantaneous power of the pulsar-like radio and high-energy emission, produces spin/orbital modulations, and is likely to lead to observable precursor emission preceding the main gravitational wave event.</description>

      <title>Shadow of rotating black holes with consistent thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16630v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit electromagnetic analogue of the post-Newtonian Hamiltonian framework widely used in gravitational-wave physics. Starting from the Lorentz-Dirac equation and implementing Landau-Lifshitz order reduction, we derive the near-zone 1.5 PN dipole radiation-reaction force and combine it with the Darwin Hamiltonian through 1PN order to obtain a closed canonical N-body phase-space system. The equations are directly implementable, strictly conservative when dissipation is switched off, and exhibit monotonic energy loss, secular inspiral, and circularization when radiation reaction is included. For binaries we derive analytic circular and eccentric inspiral laws, including 1PN conservative corrections to the dipole-driven inspiral and merger time. Extending to charged compact binaries in Einstein-Maxwell theory, we combine the 2PN ADM-type conservative Hamiltonian with leading 1.5PN dipole dissipation and gravitational quadrupole flux, obtaining gauge-invariant energy--frequency relations, closed-form circular inspiral laws, and a dipole-quadrupole crossover scale that separates electromagnetic and gravitational flux dominated inspirals.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Heating of Compact Stars Beyond Capture: A Relativistic Framework for Energy Deposition by Particle Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, can act as detectors of energetic particle fluxes originating from astrophysical accelerators. While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating.</description>

      <title>Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551</link>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schr\"{o}dinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</description>
