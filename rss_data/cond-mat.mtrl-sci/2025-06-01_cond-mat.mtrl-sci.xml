      <title>Band Structure Engineering of Coupled-Resonator Phononic Polyacetylene and Polyaminoborane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A methodology for constructing a quasi-one-dimensional coupled-resonator phononic metamaterial is presented. This is achieved through the design of artificial phononic analogs of two molecular structures: trans-polyacetylene and trans-polyaminoborane. The band structure of trans-polyacetylene is analyzed in relation to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, while that of trans-polyaminoborane is examined using the $\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation, both within a tight-binding framework. Additionally, the obtained finite realization of the artificial trans-polyacetylene exhibits topologically protected states.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Prediction of the Effect of Neutron Irradiation on the Ductile-to-Brittle Transition in Fe-Ni-Cr Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fracture behavior of irradiated Fe-Ni-Cr alloys, focusing on the radiation-induced ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT). Unlike the commonly studied temperature-driven DBT, this transition is driven by radiation-induced defects, which impede dislocation motion and reduce the material's capacity for plastic deformation, ultimately leading to brittle failure. Utilizing Molecular Dynamics simulations, this work examines the interaction between radiation-induced defects, such as dislocation loops and voids, and their influence on crack propagation and energy dissipation mechanisms. The results reveal distinct roles played by these defects: voids facilitate crack growth by reducing local cohesive energy, while dislocation loops act as barriers that impede crack advancement and redirect crack paths, significantly altering crack morphology. Building on the classical approach of separating fracture energy into brittle cleavage and plastic components, this study adapts this decomposition to irradiated materials. This approach appraises the distinct roles of surface energy and plastic work across varying radiation damage levels, providing critical insights into how irradiation-induced defects govern fracture dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interaction between shallow NV$^-$ and spin active azafullerenes on hydrogenated and fluorinated (001) diamond surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between surface-lying nitrogen-substituted fullerenes (radical azafullerene, C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$) with sub-surface negative nitrogen-vacancy complexes (NV$^-$) in diamond is investigated using first principles calculations. We consider (2$\times$1) reconstructed (001) oriented diamond surfaces with both H- and F-surface termination. The charge stability of NV$^-$, when in close proximity to both the nearby surface and the spin active azafullerene is discussed, in the context of diamond band bending arising from surface-induced changes in electron affinity (EA). In the case of the hydrogenated surface, the system spin is quenched, yielding a negatively charged azafullerene (C$_{59}$N$^-$) and neutrally charged NV$^0$ as the most stable electronic configuration. In contrast, fluorinating the surface favours the negatively charged NV$^-$, and conserves the C$_{59}$N$^\bullet$, neutrality and stabilizes uncompensated free spins. This opposing behaviour is attributed to surface charge doping emerging from different band bending effects associated with the surface EA. This study is consistent with experimentally observed photoluminescence quenching, and shows that surface passivation by fluorination could efficiently tackle the problem of charge transfer between adsorbed molecules and shallow NV centers.</description>

      <title>Electrical Detection of Single-Domain N\'eel Vector Reorientation across the Spin-Flop Transition in Cr2O3 Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical transport measurements in heterostructures of antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 bulk crystals and a thin Pt layer exhibit sharp responses as the N\'eel vector of the Cr2O3 undergoes the spin-flop transition. This abrupt change can arise from several distinct mechanisms including magnetostriction, proximity-induced anomalous Hall, spin Hall anomalous Hall, and spin Hall planar Hall effects. While large Pt devices sensing multiple up/down domains can produce indistinguishable Hall signal jumps due to different initial N\'eel vector orientations, smaller Pt devices that sense single domains isolate the proximity-induced Hall signals. This allows direct electrical detection of N\'eel vector reorientation across the spin-flop transition in single domain regions. Furthermore, the single-domain state can be prepared by magnetic field cooling or magnetoelectric cooling. We demonstrate a method to control and characterize almost the three-dimensional orientation of single-domain N\'eel vectors by exploiting Hall measurements and cooling techniques, crucial for future antiferromagnetic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Domain Wall Pinning in Ferroelectrics via Automated High Throughput AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$ were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing ferroelectric memories.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Characterization of Thin Film MoS$_2$ Using Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth and characterization of materials using empirical optimization typically requires a significant amount of expert time, experience, and resources. Several complementary characterization methods are routinely performed to determine the quality and properties of a grown sample. Machine learning (ML) can support the conventional approaches by using historical data to guide and provide speed and efficiency to the growth and characterization of materials. Specifically, ML can provide quantitative information from characterization data that is typically obtained from a different modality. In this study, we have investigated the feasibility of projecting the quantitative metric from microscopy measurements, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), using data obtained from spectroscopy measurements, like Raman spectroscopy. Generative models were also trained to generate the full and specific features of the Raman and photoluminescence spectra from each other and the AFM images of the thin film MoS$_2$. The results are promising and have provided a foundational guide for the use of ML for the cross-modal characterization of materials for their accelerated, efficient, and cost-effective discovery.</description>

      <title>Line and Planar Defects with Zero Formation Free Energy: Applications of the Phase Rule toward Ripening-Immune Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended one- and two-dimensional defects in crystalline materials are usually metastable. The thermodynamic ground state of the material is presumed to be defect-free. Here, we investigate the conditions under which extended defects, such as grain boundaries, can exist in a multicomponent alloy when the latter reaches the thermodynamic ground state allowed by the Gibbs phase rule. We treat all extended defects as low-dimensional phases on the same footing as the conventional bulk phases. Thermodynamic analysis shows that, in the ground state, the formation free energies of all extended defects must be zero, and the system must follow a generalized phase rule. The latter predicts that only a finite number of symmetry-related defect types can coexist in the material in the ground state. Guided by the phase rule, we discuss finite-size polycrystalline and/or polyphase microstructures that are fully immune to coarsening and their possible transformations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Breaking Magneto-Optical Effects in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets (AMs), hosting momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization, have attracted intensive attention for their promising application in novel spintronics. However, limited by facility and material constraints, experimentally distinguishing them from conventional antiferromagnets (AFMs) remains a challenge, which hinders the high-throughput screening for AM candidates. Here, we predict strain-mediated magneto-optical responses in AMs, which can serve as a universal and experimentally accessible strategy for efficient identification of AMs. Symmetry analysis reveals that uniaxial strain can selectively breaks rotation or mirror symmetries in AMs while preserving $PT$ symmetry in AFMs, thereby activating distinct linear magneto-optical responses (e.g., optical absorption and Kerr rotation) unique to AMs. First-principles calculations across prototypical systems -- including semiconducting V$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer and metallic CrSb bulk -- show that the strain-induced optical signatures are significant enough for conventional optical measurements. Our work establishes a rapid, non-invasive characterization methodology for altermagnetism across material platforms, accelerating its exploration for spin-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Photostriction-tunable Polarization and Structural Dynamics in Interlayer Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectrics with robust polarization offer promising opportunities for non-volatile memory, field-effect transistors, and optoelectronic devices. However, the impact of lattice deformation on polarization and photoinduced structural response remains poorly understood. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to demonstrate photodoping-induced lattice expansion in rhombohedrally stacked bilayer MoS2, revealing a strong coupling between photodoping carrier and lattice structure. We identify a pronounced photostrictive response in sliding ferroelectrics, wherein electron-hole excitation leads to substantial in-plane expansion, increased interlayer spacing, and enhanced ferroelectric polarization. This strain-induced modulation drives significant bandgap renormalization. The photostriction-tunable polarization and structural dynamics arise from the strong electromechanical coupling inherent to the non-centrosymmetric rhombohedral stacking. The findings provide critical insights into the nonthermal lattice expansion governing sliding ferroelectrics at atomic-scale timescales, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for next-generation electronic and memory technologies by leveraging lattice-tunable polarization switching.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Topological Nature of TaIrTe4, SrSi2, and Cu2XY3: An ab-initio Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several topological electronic materials have been theoretically predicted, leading to a comprehensive catalog systematically characterized by their band crossings. Researchers have attempted to experimentally verify the topological nature of some materials from the present catalogs, but not all efforts have yielded positive results. Here, we introduce a possible reason for the discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results. In this direction, firstly we have revisited the nature of the well-known topological materials TaIrTe$_4$ and SrSi$_2$ using \textit{state-of-the-art ab-initio} calculations, and found additional Weyl points in both materials that were missing in previously reported studies. Then we have verified the recently predicted topological states of the \textit{Imm2}-phase of Cu$_2$XY$_3$ (X=Si, Ge, Sn \&amp; Y=S, Se, Te). Contrary to previously reported results, we did not find any Weyl points or nodal arcs in Cu$_2$SnTe$_3$. Notably, our theoretical results reveal that Cu$_2$SiTe$_3$, Cu$_2$GeTe$_3$ and Cu$_2$GeSe$_3$ each host four small nodal rings, eight Weyl points, and eight nodal arcs, respectively, which differ from previous studies. Considering Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ as an example, we have also investigated the robustness of the topological phase against local strain. Our study provides insights into the inconsistencies between theoretical predictions and experimental results, and demonstrates how the topological phase is sensitive to changes in lattice parameters, atomic positions, and exchange-correlation functionals.</description>

      <title>Fe contribution to the magnetic anisotropy of $L{1_0}$-ordered FePt thin films studied by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), $L1_0$-ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe $3d$ electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe $L_{2,3}$ edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment $m_\text{T}$, which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe $3d$ electrons. Detected finite $m_\text{T}$ indicates that the spin-polarized Fe $3d$ electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This $m_\text{T}$ of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA, and reduces the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of $L1_0$-ordered FePt thin films.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Circular Dichroism at the Oxygen K edge in Microcrystals of Spinels Grown on Ru(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the circular magnetic dichroism in the x-ray absorption at the K-edge of oxygen in microcrystals of different spinel oxides. The microcrystals are islands of micrometric size and nanometric thickness, grown on Ru(0001) substrates using high-temperature oxygen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The domains observed in the oxygen K-edge dichroism have the same distribution and orientation as those observed in x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the L$_{3}$ edge of the octahedral cations. Integrating the area from a single domain, x-ray magnetic circular dichroic spectra of oxygen were measured and, by the application of the K-edge sum rule, non vanishing orbital magnetic moments aligned with the octahedral cations were found. Density functional theory calculations, which did not show any orbital moment at the oxygen anions, indicate that the energy ranges where oxygen dichroism is observed correspond to those with significant hybridization with the cations d bands. They also show a correlation between the magnitude of the measured value of the oxygen orbital moment and the theoretical one for the cations, and demonstrate that this trend is preserved in the presence of Fe excess in the samples. Our experimental XMCD suggest, following the DFT calculations, that the origin of the oxygen magnetic moment lies in the hybridization of the oxygen unoccupied p-derived bands with the cation bands, mostly with the d-derived ones.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Local Electrostatic Potential and Temperature-Driven Atomistic Forming Mechanisms in TaOx/HfO2-Based ReRAMs using Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) with a bilayer TaOx/HfO2 stack structure have been shown to possess uniquely promising resistive switching characteristics. However, the key atomistic forming mechanisms and the physical processes that govern the behavior of this kind of device remain to be clarified. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the physical mechanisms underlying its forming at the atomistic level through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using an extended charge equilibration scheme to describe the effects of applied voltage with the charge transfer ionic potential formalism. The displacement of the tantalum ions was found to be the highest, followed by that of the hafnium ions, in response to a sufficiently high applied voltage across the electrodes, whereas the oxygen ions had a relatively minor voltage-driven response. This led to the formation of a tantalum-depleted, oxygen-rich zone near the positive top electrode acting as the anode and the clustering of oxygen vacancies that nucleated into the filament near the negative bottom electrode, or the cathode. This process resulted in partial shielding of the bulk dielectric from the applied voltage. We found a minimum threshold voltage was required to initiate vacancy clustering to form the filament. Filament growth during forming is attributed to a localized mechanism, driven by thermally activated generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which get stabilized by the local electric fields near the edge of the nucleated filament at the cathode.</description>

      <title>Crystal Growth &amp; Physical Property Characterization of Mixed Topological Insulator BiSbTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reports the synthesis of a single crystalline mixed topological insulator (TI) BiSbTe$_3$ and its detailed structural and magneto-transport properties. The single crystalline samples of BiSbTe$_3$ are grown by the melt-growth process and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and Raman spectroscopy. The single crystal XRD peaks dictated the growth direction along the c-axis. The Raman spectrum elucidated the characteristic peaks of the mixed topological insulator. The broadening of Raman peaks exhibited the formation of Te-Bi-Te and Te-Sb-Te bonds and associated vibrational modes. The single crystals are characterized by magneto-transport measurements down to 2 K and up to 14 Tesla transverse magnetic field. The residual resistance ratio (R200 K/R0 K) is found to be 3.64, which endorses the metallic nature of the synthesized crystal. The relative resistance turns out to be higher for the mixed TI than the pure TIs i.e., Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Sb$_2$Te$_3$. The lower Debye temperature (82.64 K) of BiSbTe$_3$ connotes the presence of effective electron-phonon interaction at quite low temperatures in comparison to pure TI, which explains the observed suppression in magnetoresistance (MR) for the mixed TI. At 2 K, an MR of 150 percent is observed for BiSbTe$_3$, which is suppressed in contrast to the pure TIs i.e., Bi$_2$Te$_3$ or Sb$_2$Te$_3$. Though the MR% is suppressed significantly, its non-saturating linear behavior indicates the topological nature of the studied mixed TI. The modified Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) equation analysis of magneto-conductivity of mixed TI revealed that the conductivity has not only a surface states driven 2D component but also contributions from the bulk charge carriers and quantum scattering.</description>

      <title>Accelerated ultrafast demagnetization of an interlayer-exchange-coupled Co/Mn/Co trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of an interlayer-exchange-coupled Co/Mn/Co trilayer system after excitation with an ultrafast optical pump. We probe element- and time-resolved ferromagnetic order by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism in resonant reflectivity. We observe an accelerated Co demagnetization time in the case of weak total parallel interlayer coupling at 9.5 ML Mn thickness for antiparallel alignment of both Co layers compared to parallel alignment as well as for parallel alignment in the case of strong parallel interlayer coupling at 11 ML of Mn. From ab initio time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we conclude that optically induced intersite spin transfer of spin-polarized electrons from Co into Mn acts as a decay channel to enhance and accelerate ultrafast demagnetization. This spin transfer can only take place in case of a collinear Mn spin structure. We argue that this is the case for antiparallel alignment of both Co layers at 9.5 ML Mn thickness and parallel alignment in case of 11 ML of Mn. Our results point out that an antiferromagnetic spacer layer and its spin structure have a significant effect on the magnetization dynamics of adjacent ferromagnetic layers. Our findings provide further insight into fundamental mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization and may lead to improve dynamics in multilayered systems for faster optical switching of magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen defects and band alignment in metal-organic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band alignment, namely the prediction of band-edge positions of semiconductors and insulators in aqueous solutions, is an important problem in physics and chemistry. Such a prediction is especially challenging for complex materials. Here we present an approach to align band structure of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an absolute energy scale which can be used for direct comparison with experiments. Hydrogen defects are used as probes into the chemical bonding of the covalently bonded hybrid materials. An effective defect energy level, defined as the average of the charge-state transition levels of the defects at the linker and at the secondary building unit, is identified as a charge neutrality level to align band structures. This level captures subtle chemical details at both the organic and inorganic building blocks and provides results that are in agreement with experiments in a wide range of different MOFs. We also compare with results obtained from using other approaches involving surface calculations and average pore-center electrostatic potentials.</description>

      <title>Structural Stability of Sulfur Depleted MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly monolayer MoS2, have received increased attention in materials science and have been exploited in diverse applications from photonics to catalysis. Defects in TMDs play a crucial role in modulating their properties, and understanding defect-induced dynamics is of great importance. This study investigates the dynamics of sulfur depletion in defective monolayer MoS2, which yields stable MoS monolayers. Various defect sizes, temperature regimes, and substrate effects were investigated. Through comprehensive classical molecular (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, we elucidate the dynamics of sulfur vacancy formation in MoS2 lattices. After removing all sulfur atoms from the top layer, several sulfur atoms from the bottom layer spontaneously migrate to the top layer as a response to increase structural stability, thus creating a MoSx alloy. These findings deepen our understanding of defect dynamics in TMDs, offering valuable insights into the controlled engineering of their properties for nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetoimpedance properties of CoNbZr, multilayer CoNbZr/Au and multilayer NiFe/Au thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film magnetic sensors using the giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) effect show great promise for sensitive low-field magnetic measurements. Optimising sensor performance requires a thorough understanding of the properties of various soft magnetic materials. This study examines the electric, magnetic, and GMI properties of sputtered single-layer amorphous CoNbZr, multilayer amorphous CoNbZr/Au, and crystalline NiFe/Au thin films. GMI measurements reveal distinct ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequencies: 1.4 GHz for CoNbZr, 0.7 GHz for CoNbZr/Au, and 0.5 GHz for NiFe/Au. Au interlayers improve the GMI response, increasing the GMI ratio by 50% and reducing FMR frequency compared to single-layer CoNbZr. The highest GMI ratio of 300% occurs in a 20 $\mu$m x 5000 $\mu$m CoNbZr/Au strip at 1.8 GHz under 2 mT, while NiFe/Au exhibits 280% at 4 mT. These differences are linked to variations in in-plane demagnetising factors and saturation magnetisations, emphasising the role of material and geometry in GMI sensor performance.</description>

      <title>First principles computations of the Stark shift of a defect-bound exciton: the case of the T center in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The T center in silicon has recently drawn a lot of attention for its potential in quantum information science. The sensitivity of the zero-phonon line (ZPL) to electrical field was recently investigated by a combination of different experimental methods but there is still no first principles study on the Stark shift of the T center. Dealing with the defect-bound exciton nature of the excited state is particularly challenging using density functional theory because of the large spatial delocalization associated with the wavefunction. Here, we tackle this issue by performing a convergence study over the supercell size. We obtain an exciton binding energy of 28.5meV, in good agreement with experimental results. We then calculate the Stark shift through the dipole moment change of the ZPL transition of the T center using the modern theory of polarization formalism and find a modest linear coefficient of $\Delta \mu$=0.79D along X and $\Delta \mu$=0.03D along Y. We discuss our results in light of the recent experimental measurements of the Stark shift. Our analysis suggests that bound-exciton defects could be particularly sensitive to local field effect as a result of their large spatial extent.</description>

      <title>Accurate grain boundary plane distributions for textured microstructures from stereological analysis of orthogonal two-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction orientation maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for obtaining qualitatively accurate grain boundary plane distributions (GBPD) for textured microstructures using a stereological calculation applied to two-dimensional electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) orientation maps. Stereology, applied to 2D EBSD orientation maps, is currently the fastest method of obtaining GBPDs. Existing stereological methods are not directly applicable to textured microstructures because of the biased viewing perspectives for different grain boundary types supplied from a single planar orientation map. The method presented in this work successfully removes part of this bias by combining data from three orthogonal EBSD orientation maps for stereology. This is shown here to produce qualitatively correct GBPDs for heavily textured synthetic microstructures with hexagonal and tetragonal crystal symmetries. Synthetic microstructures were generated to compare the stereological GBPD to a known ground truth, as the true GBPD could be obtained from a triangular mesh of the full grain boundary network in 3D. The triangle mesh data contained all five macroscopic parameters to fully describe the grain boundary structure. It was observed that our stereological method overestimated the GBPD anisotropy. However, qualitative analysis of the GBPD remains useful. Furthermore, it was found that combining data from three orthogonal sections gives reliable results when sectioning the texture's primary axes.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electron dynamics upon above band-gap excitation in epitaxial LaFeO$_3$(001) thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong electron correlations in perovskite oxides give rise to rich and often unexpected electronic phenomena. In this study, we present a comprehensive surface-science investigation of epitaxial thin films of the charge-transfer insulator LaFeO$_3$(001). The characterization includes low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and photoemission spectroscopy. We map both the occupied and unoccupied electronic states using two-photon photoemission (2PPE) spectroscopy. Furthermore, we probe electron dynamics through an ultraviolet-ultraviolet (UV-UV) pump-probe experiment, exciting electrons from hybridized O~$2p$/Fe $3d$ states to Fe minority-spin states above the band gap. Our results reveal three distinct unoccupied states, which we assign to Fe $t_{2g\downarrow}$, Fe $e_{g\downarrow}$, and La $5d$ orbitals. Notably, the conduction band minimum exhibits a biexponential decay with time constants of 39\,fs and 1100\,fs, suggesting the presence of two independent decay pathways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we reported the structural and electronic properties of the Heusler compound Co2FeGe using the AKAI-KKR code under the GGA approximation. We established that this material presents not only magnetic character but also has a metallic behavior. Our calculations have been conducted using the DFT method in the framework of the AKAI-KKR code. This study enabled us to define certain characteristics and initial parameters for creating a model of the system. The method used allowed us to apply fundamental concepts to the studied system in the form of modeling. The main results, of the studied Heusler compound Co2FeGe are: i) this material is magnetic; ii) The band structure of the material predicts a metallic character; iii) the origin of magnetism comes mainly from the transition metals Co and Fe atoms. These results, assure that the studied quaternary Heusler Co2FeGe stands for a strong candidate for different spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Bubble-Burst Synthesis of Ammonia, Amino Acids, and Urea Under Ambient, Catalyst-Free Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a catalyst-free, ambient-temperature method for synthesizing nitrogen-based compounds critical to fertilizer production, including ammonia, urea, ammonium salts, and amino acids. The process relies on bubble-burst-induced microenvironments, where gas bubbles undergo rapid growth and collapse, releasing intense localized energy sufficient to dissociate nitrogen and water molecules. These high-energy zones produce reactive species, including atomic hydrogen (H*) that facilitate nitrogen fixation and drive subsequent chemical transformations without needing catalysts or elevated conditions. Experimental validation using colorimetric assays, Raman spectroscopy, and microscopy confirms the in situ formation of ammonia and its downstream conversion into structurally relevant compounds, including peptide-like assemblies. The system supports reaction tuning through dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic acids and can be enhanced by low-energy inputs such as UV or ultrasound. Its simplicity, modularity, and ability to operate without external infrastructure offer a practical and scalable platform for decentralized fertilizer generation and sustainable biochemical production.</description>

      <title>Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, tuning the electron-scattering mechanisms beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also new perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal crystals are fully ordered, but real-world crystals always contain defects breaking translational symmetry. Random defects in crystals have important implications and they e.g. provide the foundation for semiconductor-based electronic devices. Structurally correlated defects introduce an additional level of complexity, which may lead to novel materials properties, but rationalization of relations between correlated disorder and the emergent material properties are very rare. Here we report that the defect structure of the mineral Kutinaite, Ag6Cu14.4As7, exhibits unprecedented metallic diamagnetism, a hallmark of non-trivial electronic states that require delicate symmetrical protection. Using a combination of X-ray scattering methodologies, simulations, and physical property measurements, we deduced and verified subtle frustrated vacancy ordering of the Cu sublattice when cooling crystals below ~300 K. The vacancy frustration in Kutinaite leads to unique quantum properties, and our study calls for a reconsideration of the role of vacancies as quasi-chemical species in crystals.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in harnessing non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Hieratical Twist in Polar Fluids: Ultra-Low Field-Induced Chirality Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered helical polar fluid adopts a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (CSB) driven by polarization escape and conformational chirality. Ferroelectric nematic and smectic phases are intrinsically chiral in the ground state and can be stabilized in an extrinsic twisted configuration through surface anchoring. Herein, we introduce extrinsic CSB as a novel technique in chiral engineering. To demonstrate this concept, we constructed the extrinsic structure of a helielectric conical mesophase (HEC)-multi-dimensional chiral system. Considering the challenges of controlling chirality at the macroscopic scale owing to magnetic fields, light, and fluid vortex motion, the proposed multi-dimensional chiral system enables chirality (twist) modulation through an ultralow electric field, thereby controlling unique diffraction pattern and circular polarized light-switching capabilities.</description>

      <title>Weak localization as probe of spin-orbit-induced spin-split bands in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity coupling of bilayer graphene (BLG) to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a promising route to engineer gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) while preserving BLG's exceptional electronic properties. This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent transport through edge states in 2D semi-Dirac materials with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and band inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk-boundary correspondence in two-dimensional type-I semi-Dirac materials with band inversion and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Employing a dimensional reduction framework, we identify the Zak phase along the quadratically dispersing direction as a topological invariant that captures the presence of edge states. In the non-trivial topological regime, systems with finite width exhibit energy-dependent edge states that are topologically protected only at specific momenta. At kx equal to zero, symmetry-protected edge states emerge, analogous to the Rashba-free case. At finite kx, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and band structure gives rise to spin-dependent edge states, localized on specific edges based on its spin and particle-hole character. We compute spin-resolved conductance through these edge channels and observe robust, tunable oscillations attributable to spin precession induced by the effective Rashba magnetic field. These results reveal how spin-orbit interactions enrich the edge physics of semi-Dirac systems and provide a platform for spintronic control in anisotropic topological materials.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the Theory and Atomistic Simulation of Metal Electrodeposition</title>

Abstract: Electrodeposition is a fundamental process in electrochemistry, and has applications in numerous industries, such as corrosion protection, decorative finishing, energy storage, catalysis, and electronics. While there is a long history of using electrodeposition, its application for controlled nanostructure growth is limited. The establishment of an atomic-scale understanding of the electrodeposition process and dynamics is crucial to enable the controlled fabrication of metal nanoparticles and other nanostructures. Significant advancements in molecular simulation capabilities and the electronic structure theory of electrified solid-liquid interfaces bring theory closer to realistic applications, but a gap remains between realistic applications, theoretical understanding of dynamics, and atomistic simulation. In this review we briefly summarize the current state-of-the-art computational techniques available for the simulation of electrodeposition and electrochemical growth on surfaces, and identify the remaining open challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skutterudites are promising materials for thermoelectric and spintronics applications. Here we explore spin fluctuations in the FeSb$_{3}$ skutterudite and their effect on its electronic structure using Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory calculations. We identify multiple magnetic and charge-disproportionated configurations, with an antiferromagnetic metallic ground state. Paramagnetic fluctuations modeled through a special quasirandom spin structure open a 61 meV gap, consistent with experiments. This state features non-degenerate spin channels and band-avoided crossings, resembling a Luttinger-compensated ferrimagnet with topological features. Mapping the electronic structure to a Heisenberg Hamiltonian fails to explain the low N\'eel temperature ($\lesssim$10 K), suggesting that factors such as stoichiometry and magnetic exchange frustration may play an important role, calling for more detailed experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and transport properties of a metallic altermagnet CrSb on a GaAs (001) substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising because of its high ordering temperature (~705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the N\'eel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a two-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.</description>

      <title>Analytic approach to creating homogeneous fields with finite-size magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogeneous magnetic fields can be generated through the strategic arrangement of permanent magnets. The Halbach array serves as a prominent example of an effective design following this principle. However, it is a two-dimensional approach because it is optimal when placing infinitely long magnets -- line dipoles -- on a circle. If shorter, more realistic magnets are to be used, the optimal arrangement of magnetic moments diverges from the classical Halbach geometry. This paper presents optimal solutions for three-dimensional arrangements calculated for point dipoles, including optimized orientations for single rings and stacks of two rings. They are superior to the original Halbach arrangement and a modification described in the literature, both in terms of the strength and the homogeneity of the magnetic field. Analytic formulae are provided for both cases and tested by experimental realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors, a promising group of materials for electronics, is underpinned by their vibrational (phonon) dynamics. However, surface phonons in layered materials remain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental techniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to measure the lowest energy (&lt;10meV) dispersions of surface phonons on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a prototypical 2D semiconductor. We reveal that the widely studied E_2g and A_2u modes possess mixed acoustic-optical character, displaying unexpected quartic and quadratic dispersion relations, and finite-layer confinement to the surface of 4-5 and 6 layers, respectively. Crucially, we find no evidence of any pure acoustic mode at the surface of MoS2. This suppresses anharmonic phonon decay processes, thereby limiting thermal transport and providing a mechanistic explanation for poor thermal conductivity in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystallinity on spin-orbit torque in 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides provide an intriguing platform for generating an efficient spin current due to a unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on the effect of crystallinity on current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT) in binary 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$ thin films by controlling amorphous, polycrystalline, and epitaxial states. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and IrO$_{2}$, we find that dampinglike (DL) SOT is larger than fieldlike SOT for all the samples. We also demonstrate that both electrical resistivity and the DL SOT efficiency increase in order of epitaxial, polycrystalline, and amorphous IrO$_{2}$. Despite their different electrical conductivities, spin Hall conductivities of the three states of the IrO$_{2}$ layer are found to be nearly constant, which is consistent with the intrinsic regime of the spin Hall effect scaling relation. Our results highlight the important role that crystallinity plays in the spin-current generation, leading to the potential technological development of spintronic devices based on the 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Substrate Effect on Electronic Band Structure and Topological Property in Monolayer V2O3 Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer V2O3, a two-dimensional magnetic topological insulator with intrinsic ferromagnetic order and a nontrivial band gap, offers a promising platform for realizing quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the impact of substrate selection on its electronic and topological properties. By modeling heterostructures with van der Waals (vdW) substrates, we demonstrate that non-magnetic substrates such as h-BN preserve the QAH phase with a Chern number C = 1, maintaining gapless chiral edge states. In contrast, ferromagnetic substrates induce extra electrons, destroying the topological order by shifting the Fermi level. These findings establish substrate engineering as a pivotal strategy for experimental realization of dissipationless edge transport in V2O3-based vdW heterostructures, advancing their potential applications as low-power topological electronics.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Reciprocity in Orbital-Charge-Coupled Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupled transport of charge and orbital angular momentum (OAM) lies at the core of orbitronics. Here, we examine the reciprocal relation in orbital-charge-coupled transport in thin films, treating bulk and surface contributions on equal footing. We argue that the conventional definition of orbital current is ill-defiled, as it violates reciprocity due to the nonconservation of OAM. This issue is resolved by adopting the so-called \emph{proper} orbital current, which is directly linked to orbital accumulation. We establish the reciprocal relation for the \emph{global} (spatially integrated) response between orbital and charge currents, while showing that their \emph{local} (spatially resolved) responses can differ significantly. In particular, we find large surface contributions that may lead to nonreciprocity when currents are measured locally. These findings are supported by first-principles calculations on W(110) and Pt(111) thin films. In W(110), orbital-charge interconversion is strongly nonreciprocal at the layer level, despite exact reciprocity in the integrated response. Interestingly, spin-charge interconversion in W(110) remains nearly reciprocal even locally. In contrast, Pt(111) exhibits local nonreciprocity for both orbital-charge and spin-charge conversions, which we attribute to strong spin-orbit coupling. We propose that such local distinctions can be exploited to experimentally differentiate spin and orbital currents.</description>

Abstract: The third-order anomalous Hall effect (TOAHE) driven by Berry connection polarizability in Dirac materials offers a promising avenue for exploring quantum geometric phenomena. We investigate the role of impurity scattering on TOAHE using the semiclassical Boltzmann framework, via a comparison of the intrinsic contributions (stemming from the Berry connection polarizability) with the extrinsic contributions caused by the disorder. To validate our theoretical findings, we employ a generalized two-dimensional low-energy Dirac model to analytically assess the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the TOAHE. Our analysis reveals distinct disorder-mediated effects, including skew-scattering and side-jump contributions. We also elucidate their intriguing dependencies on Fermi surface anisotropy and discuss opportunities for experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Scalable amplitude of Sondheimer oscillations in thin cadmium crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) can predict energy, force, and stress of materials and enable a wide range of downstream discovery tasks. A key design choice in MLIPs involves the trade-off between invariant and equivariant architectures. Invariant models offer computational efficiency but may not perform as well, especially when predicting high-order outputs. In contrast, equivariant models can capture high-order symmetries, but are computationally expensive. In this work, we propose HIENet, a hybrid invariant-equivariant materials interatomic potential model that integrates both invariant and equivariant message passing layers, while provably satisfying key physical constraints. HIENet achieves state-of-the-art performance with considerable computational speedups over prior models. Experimental results on both common benchmarks and downstream materials discovery tasks demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HIENet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kramers degeneracy is one fundamental embodiment of the quantum mechanical nature of particles with half-integer spin under time reversal symmetry. Under the chiral and noncentrosymmetric achiral crystalline symmetries, Kramers degeneracy emerges respectively as topological quasiparticles of Weyl fermions and Kramers nodal lines (KNLs), anchoring the Berry phase-related physics of electrons. However, an experimental demonstration for ideal KNLs well isolated at the Fermi level is lacking. Here, we establish a class of noncentrosymmetric achiral intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide superconductors with large Ising-type spin-orbit coupling, represented by In$_x$TaS$_2$, to host an ideal KNL phase. We provide evidence from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with spin resolution, angle-dependent quantum oscillation measurements, and ab-initio calculations. Our work not only provides a realistic platform for realizing and tuning KNLs in layered materials, but also paves the way for exploring the interplay between KNLs and superconductivity, as well as applications pertaining to spintronics, valleytronics, and nonlinear transport.</description>

Abstract: Cu2(pymca)3(ClO4) (pymca: pyrimidine-2-carboxylate) consists of a slightly distorted honeycomb lattice of Cu2+ spins, which shows no long-range magnetic order down to 0.6 K. A magnetization study revealed 1/3 and 2/3 plateau phases [A. Okutani et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 88, 013703 (2019)], which is not expected for regular honeycomb antiferromagnets. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed using a powder sample to investigate the exchange interactions of this material. The spin excitations from the singlet ground state to the first three triplet states, predicted from the antiferromagnetic hexagonal spin cluster interacting with 3.9 meV, were observed. Using the exact diagonalization mothods, the intercluster coupling was estimated from the excitation peak width to be about 20% of the intracluster interaction, which is consistent with the previously reported value. Our exchange path model explains the anisotropic exchange interactions in the distorted honeycomb plane.</description>

Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).</description>
