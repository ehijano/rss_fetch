      <title>Imaging magnetic flux trapping in lanthanum hydride using diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lanthanum hydride has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its signatures of superconductivity at around 250 K (1, 2). However, the megabar pressures required for synthesize and maintain its state present extraordinary challenges for experiments, particularly in characterizing its Meissner effect (3, 4). The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has emerged as a promising quantum probe to address this problem (5-8), but a gap remains between its working pressure and the pressure required to study the superconducting state of lanthanum hydride (9-12). In this work, using neon gas as the pressure transmitting medium, the working pressure of NV centers is extended to nearly 200 GPa. This quantum probe is then applied to study the Meissner effect of a LaH$_{9.6}$ sample, synthesized by laser heating ammonia borane and lanthanum. A strong magnetic shielding effect is observed, with the transition temperature beginning at around 180 K and completing at 220 K. In addition, magnetic field imaging after field cooling reveals strong flux trapping and significant inhomogeneities within the sample. Our work provides compelling evidence for superconductivity in lanthanum hydride and highlights the importance of spatially resolved techniques in characterizing samples under ultrahigh pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Effects of successive annealing on high-field electrical transport and the upper critical field in S-substituted FeTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since iron-based superconductors have been discovered, many scientists have focused on their characteristic properties, such as an unconventional mechanism and a high upper critical field. Sulphur-substituted FeTe compounds are one of the members of the iron-based superconductors; however, chemical processes, such as O$_2$ annealing, are needed to induce superconductivity because of the existence of excess iron in as-grown crystals. Thus, the removal of excess iron and the obtaining of clean sulphur-substituted FeTe can play a key role in the understanding of the superconducting properties and the application to the superconducting devices. In this study, we present the successive annealing effects on sulphur-substituted FeTe compounds to investigate the electrical transport properties under high magnetic fields. Our measurements show that successive annealing processes improve the electrical transport properties in the superconducting states under magnetic fields. The removal of excess iron acting as magnetic impurities is indicated by the improvement of the upper critical field and its analysis.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Responses of Vortex Lattices in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electro-magnetic responses of ordered vortex lattices in unconventional superconductors
  are studied in a high field approximation. In the cases with a vortex lattice formed within
  the lowest Landau level of the superconducting order parameter (OP) such as a conventional
  s-wave paired system with a single OP and a nonchiral spin triplet paired one with multiple
  components of OPs, the vanishing of the superfluid stiffness for a gauge field disturbance
  perpendicular to the applied uniform magnetic field is found to be ensured only for the vortex
  lattice structures minimizing the free energy. The notion of the vanishing superfluid stiff ness ensured by minimization of the free energy is found to be satisfied in a more complex
  d-wave pairing case where the vortex lattice in lower fields has an anisotropic structure de viated from the six-fold hexagonal symmetry. Interestingly, such an anisotropy in the vortex
  lattice structure of a d-wave paired superconductor is reflected not in the resulting vortex flow
  conductivities obtained after minimizing the free energy but in the elastic energy describing
  the harmonic fluctuation around the vortex lattice state. Relevance of the obtained results to
  the vortex pinning effects are discussed.</description>

      <title>Light induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in Superconducting Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a light-driven non-equilibrium vortex Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a superconductor. We use a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to demonstrate vortex-antivortex deconfinement via light induced fields. The transformation occurs independently of thermal fluctuations and is viewed as a quantum phase transition. The resulting phase map mirrors QCD phase diagram, delineating confined, premelted, and fully deconfined vortex phases. The nature of these phases is discussed. Transitions between phases are governed by light induced depairing and phase fluctuations, establishing a new class of light-induced topological transitions.</description>

      <title>THz mixing of high-order harmonics using $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ nanobridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting materials are a key for technologies enabling a large number of devices including THz wave mixers and single photon detectors, though limited at very low temperatures for conventional superconductors. High temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures. $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves (100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K. We further explore these nonlinear effects by detecting THz high-order harmonic mixing for signals from 200 GHz up to 1.4 THz using a local oscillator at 100 GHz. Our results open a path to an easy-fabricated HTS nonlinear nanodevice based on dimensional confinement suitable for terahertz applications.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature scaling laws in unconventional flat-band superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In flat-band superconductors, the electron pairing is strongly enhanced so that the critical temperature scales linearly with the interaction strength. Identifying the governing pairing mechanism in flat-band superconducting systems is therefore a central task, which may be constrained by experimental probes via low-temperature scaling measurements. A key observable underlying the Meissner effect and the resulting divergent DC conductivity is the superfluid weight. While it is well established that the minimal quantum metric provides the dominant contribution to the superfluid weight in conventional superconductors with isolated flat bands, recent studies indicate that the unconventional pairing can generate additional nonlocal quantum geometric terms. This motivates us to derive the low-temperature scaling law of the superfluid weight in two-dimensional flat-band superconductors with sufficiently isolated bands. In particular, we consider the gap function with point or line nodes classified by the Weierstrass preparation theorem. Beyond the superfluid weight, we additionally deliver explicit low-temperature scaling laws of the order parameter, the tunneling conductance, the specific heat, the Sommerfeld coefficient, and the spin-lattice relaxation rate to provide complementary experimental discriminants of the underlying pairing symmetry. The implications of our results are also elucidated by applying them to a selection of superconducting states in $C_{6v}$-symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>First non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment using a novel method based on the rate of change of a supercurrent first proposed in 2016~\cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1604.02152} and fleshed out in this current paper. The theory, experimental concept and implementation are described in detail. The non-zero nuclear electric dipole moment measured with over 1000 hours of data was that of $^{181}$Ta producing a best value $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm0.31_\text{stat})\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}$ and $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm3.18)\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}&gt;0$ at 99.985\%CL. There is an uncertainty on the value of overall multiplicative parameters such as the self-inductance of the superconducting circuit ($\pm4\%$), the mutual inductance between the SQUID pickup coil and the sample wire ($\pm15\%$), and the magnitude of the solenoid current ($\pm5\%$). An upper-limit was estimated for the control element, $^{207}$Pb, $|d_\text{e}^\text{Pb}|\lesssim1.2\cdot10^{-31}e\cdot\text{cm}$ at 95\%CL.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Orders, Quantum Criticality and Skyrmions in Tunable Topological Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are emergent many-body excitations that lie at the heart of both multi-component quantum Hall-like systems and deconfined quantum criticality. In a companion article (X. Wang et al., arXiv:2507.22971), we studied a microscopic time-reversal symmetric model of tunable interacting Chern bands using numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations, and presented evidence for the emergence of robust skyrmion excitations. These charged excitations emerge in the vicinity of a many-body insulator at a commensurate filling of the Chern bands, and lead to the onset of superconductivity when doped away from the insulating phase. Here, we present quantum Monte-Carlo results and a complementary field-theoretical analysis for the quantum phase transition(s) that arise between the intertwined phases as a function of two distinct tuning parameters. Our numerical results are consistent with a single continuous quantum phase transition between an insulating Chern antiferromagnet and a fully gapped superconductor, with an emergent SO(5) symmetry at the putative critical point, highly suggestive of deconfined quantum (pseudo-)criticality. We also present a detailed comparison between the momentum-resolved spectral functions associated with the neutral collective modes, single electron and composite spin-polaron excitations obtained using a combination of Monte-Carlo computations and a Bethe-Salpeter analysis built on top of the self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. We end with a brief outlook on some of the interesting open problems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-guided optimization of critical current in high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductors are essential for next-generation energy and quantum technologies, yet their performance is often limited by the critical current density ($J_c$), which is strongly influenced by microstructural defects. Optimizing $J_c$ through defect engineering is challenging due to the complex interplay of defect type, density, and spatial correlation. Here we present an integrated workflow that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) simulations to autonomously identify optimal defect configurations that maximize $J_c$. In our framework, TDGL simulations generate current-voltage characteristics to evaluate $J_c$, which serves as the reward signal that guides the RL agent to iteratively refine defect configurations. We find that the agent discovers optimal defect densities and correlations in two-dimensional thin-film geometries, enhancing vortex pinning and $J_c$ relative to the pristine thin-film, approaching 60\% of theoretical depairing limit with up to 15-fold enhancement compared to random initialization. This RL-driven approach provides a scalable strategy for defect engineering, with broad implications for advancing HTS applications in fusion magnets, particle accelerators, and other high-field technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence plays a key role in the operation and performance of quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath in a system formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.</description>

      <title>Thermal decoupling in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unconventional high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors, the intricate interplay between the non-ergodic bad metal and the strange metal state has remained enigmatic. Herein, we unravel this mystery using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and the temperature-dependent effective potential method. Our investigation, centered on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ , provides the first simulation report on the $B_{1g}$ phonon anomaly, unveiling thermal decoupling induced by the bond weakening between the Ba atom and CuO$_2$ plane. This decoupling emerges as a pivotal underpinning behind several puzzling phenomena in high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Our results indicate that the effective temperature on the BaO plane deviates from that of the CuO$_2$ plane at low temperatures. Furthermore, we delineate the correlation between thermal decoupling and the Planckian dissipation, rigorously and quantitatively revealing a connection between linear-$T$ resistivity, Uemura relation, and superconducting domes, which are known to be the most important unsolved mysteries of high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The suppressed isotope effect ($\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ $\approx$ 0.02) in cuprates is also quantitatively explained from thermal decoupling. Our discoveries offer a revolutionary perspective on high-$T_c$ superconductivity, suggesting the potential for a transformative shift in our comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that the autonomous emergence of low-temperature layers within materials has the potential to revolutionize industrial thermal management challenges.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and pair density waves from nearest-neighbor interactions in frustrated lattice geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider superconductivity and pair density waves (PDWs) arising from off-site pairing in frustrated lattice geometries. We express the pair susceptibility in a generic form that highlights the importance of both the density of states, and the quantum geometry of the eigenstates and calculate the superfluid weight (stiffness) as well as the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. Paradigmatic bipartite (Lieb) and non-bipartite (kagome) lattices are studied as examples. For bipartite lattices, nearest-neighbor pairing vanishes in a flat band. In the Lieb lattice flat band, we find a PDW at a finite interaction and show that its pair wave vector is determined by the quantum geometry of the band. In the kagome flat band, nearest-neighbor pairing is possible for infinitesimal interactions. At the kagome van Hove singularity, the pair susceptibility predicts a PDW due to sublattice interference, however, we find that its stiffness is zero due to the shape of the Fermi surface. Our results indicate that nearest-neighbor pairing at flat band and van Hove singularities is strongly influenced by the geometric properties of the eigenfunctions, and it is crucial to determine the superfluid weight of the superconducting and PDW orders as it may contradict the predictions by pairing susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticles and optical conductivity in the mixed state of Weyl superconductors with unconventional pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous investigations have revealed that the Weyl superconductor (WeylSC), realized in a superconductor-topological insulator heterostructure, can exhibit the Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the presence of a vortex lattice. Here, we investigate the low-energy quasiparticle (QP) excitations in the mixed state of heterostructure WeylSCs with unconventional pairing. We find that the spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing induces flat Dirac-LLs of Bogoliubov QPs, whereas the excitation spectra for the spin-triplet chiral $p$-wave pairing show noticeable dispersion, except for the chiral symmetry-protected, dispersionless, zeroth Landau level (ZLL). Distinct QP excitations in the vortex lattice of WeylSCs result in different optical responses, which are manifested as characteristic magneto-optical conductivity curves. We also show that, compared to the topologically protected, charge-neutral, localized Majorana zero mode (MZM), the chiral symmetry-protected ZLL is non-charge-neutral and delocalized. Both of these zero modes may be observed in the mixed state of a heterostructure topological superconductor.</description>

Abstract: Stimulated by recent interest in altermagnets, a novel class of antiferromagnets with macroscopic time-reversal symmetry breaking, we investigate the coexistence of altermagnetism and superconductivity. By developing a Ginzburg--Landau theory based on microscopic models, we show that a phase-modulated Fulde--Ferrell superconducting state is stabilized via altermagnetic spin splitting, in contrast to the typical amplitude-modulated states that occur under the uniform Zeeman field. We apply our framework to different models to compare the resulting phase diagrams: a two-sublattice model with altermagnetic order, a continuum model with an anisotropic Zeeman field mimicking altermagnetic spin splitting, and a conventional square-lattice model with two kinds of anisotropic Zeeman fields. We show that the multisublattice structure is crucial for realizing the phase-modulated superconductivity, and highlight spin-split altermagnets as a promising platform for exploring this exotic superconductivity without external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhancing superconductivity through material design is a central goal in quantum materials research. Moire engineering, where twisting stacked layers creates long-wavelength modulations and flat bands, has shown how electronic correlations can be amplified and eventually used to raise the superconducting critical temperature Tc. Yet this approach is largely confined to van der Waals materials and offers limited tunability. Here we explore a moire-inspired alternative: imposing artificial superpotentials on otherwise homogeneous systems to engineer flat electronic minibands. Whether such superlattice potentials can truly enhance superconductivity and sustain a finite superfluid stiffness remains, however, an open question. Our calculations show that a periodic superpotential imposed to a 2D system can indeed enhance superconductivity by reconstructing the electronic bands and creating regions of large density of states, leading to a substantial increase of Tc. In contrast to conventional flat band systems, where the superfluid stiffness arises solely from quantum geometry through the quantum metric, a modulated system inherits kinetic energy from the filled minibands below the Fermi level. This inherited component coexists with a positive quantum geometric contribution, yielding a finite and robust stiffness even when the upper band becomes nearly flat. The resulting superconducting state remains coherent and resilient against weak to moderate disorder. Our findings demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a tunable route to enhance superconductivity beyond twist based moire systems, unifying flat band amplification of pairing with preserved phase stiffness. They further highlight the central role of quantum geometry in shaping collective electronic phenomena and point to superlattice design as a promising platform for next-generation superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pair-density-wave phase of strongly interacting electrons on the triangular lattice: A variational Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A robust theory of the mechanism of pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity (i.e. where Cooper pairs have nonzero center of mass momentum) remains elusive. Here we explore the triangular lattice $t$-$J$-$V$ model, a low-energy effective theory derived from the strong-coupling limit of the Holstein-Hubbard model, by large-scale variational Monte Carlo simulations. When the electron density is sufficiently low, the favored ground state is an s-wave PDW, consistent with results obtained from previous studies in this limit. Additionally, a PDW ground state with nematic d-wave pairing emerges in the intermediate range of electron densities and phonon frequencies. For these s-wave and d-wave PDWs arising in states with spontaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries, PDW formation derives from valley-polarization and intra-pocket pairing.</description>

      <title>Altermon: a magnetic-field-free parity protected qubit based on a narrow altermagnet Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets provide a new route to engineer superconducting circuits without magnetic fields. We theoretically study the Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum of a finite-width altrmagnet-based Josephson junction and show how the $d$-wave altermagnetic symmetry and geometric confinement shape its low-energy excitations. We find a clear distinction between the two $d$-wave symmetries: $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order produces spin splitting, whereas $d_{xy}$ order preserves spin degeneracy and exhibits splitting of the ABS spectrum induced by intermode hybridization. Leveraging these novel features, we propose applying a transverse electric field to tune the system and realize a magnetic-field-free, parity-protected superconducting qubit that we call altermon.</description>
