      <title>Gradient descent in materia through homodyne gradient extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning, a multi-layered neural network approach inspired by the brain, has revolutionized machine learning. One of its key enablers has been backpropagation, an algorithm that computes the gradient of a loss function with respect to the weights and biases in the neural network model, in combination with its use in gradient descent. However, the implementation of deep learning in digital computers is intrinsically energy hungry, with energy consumption becoming prohibitively high for many applications. This has stimulated the development of specialized hardware, ranging from neuromorphic CMOS integrated circuits and integrated photonic tensor cores to unconventional, material-based computing system. The learning process in these material systems, realized, e.g., by artificial evolution, equilibrium propagation or surrogate modelling, is a complicated and time-consuming process. Here, we demonstrate a simple yet efficient and accurate gradient extraction method, based on the principle of homodyne detection, for performing gradient descent on a loss function directly in a physical system without the need of an analytical description. By perturbing the parameters that need to be optimized using sinusoidal waveforms with distinct frequencies, we effectively obtain the gradient information in a highly robust and scalable manner. We illustrate the method in dopant network processing units, but argue that it is applicable in a wide range of physical systems. Homodyne gradient extraction can in principle be fully implemented in materia, facilitating the development of autonomously learning material systems.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for an Efficient and Effective Malware Investigation during Cyber Incident Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research focused on enhancing post-incident malware forensic investigation using reinforcement learning RL. We proposed an advanced MDP post incident malware forensics investigation model and framework to expedite post incident forensics. We then implement our RL Malware Investigation Model based on structured MDP within the proposed framework. To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.</description>

      <title>From Resource Control to Digital Trust with User-Managed Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The User-Managed Access (UMA) extension to OAuth 2.0 is a promising candidate for increasing Digital Trust in personal data ecosystems like Solid. With minor modifications, it can achieve many requirements regarding usage control and transaction contextualization, even though additional specification is needed to address delegation of control and retraction of usage policies.</description>
