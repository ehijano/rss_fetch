      <title>Connecting GRBs from Binary Neutron Star Mergers to Nuclear Properties of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of the binary neutron star (NS) merger remnants hinges sensitively upon the NS equation of state and the threshold mass, $M_{\rm ls}$, that separates a long-lived from a short-lived NS remnant. The nature of the electromagnetic counterparts is also influenced by the remnant type, particularly in determining whether a gamma-ray burst from a compact binary merger (cbGRB) is of short or long duration. We propose a novel approach to probe the threshold mass by linking it to the estimated observed ratio of long to short cbGRBs. We find that current observations broadly favour a relatively high value for this transition, $M_{\rm ls}\simeq 1.3 M_{\rm TOV}$, for which $ M_{\rm TOV} \lesssim 2.6\,M_\odot $, consistent with numerical simulations, as also shown here. Our results disfavour nuclear physics scenarios that would lead to catastrophic pressure loss at a few times nuclear density and temperatures of tens of MeV, leading to a rapid gravitational collapse of binaries with total mass $M \lesssim 1.3 M_{\rm TOV}$. Future individual gravitational wave events with on-axis cbGRBs can further bound $M_{\rm ls}$.</description>

      <title>Did IceCube discover Dark Matter around Blazars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jet and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Radiative Implications of Jet-Star Interactions in AGN Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their stellar environments significantly influence jet dynamics and emission characteristics. In low-power jets, such as those in Fanaroff-Riley I (FR I) galaxies, the jet-star interactions can notably affect jet deceleration and energy dissipation.
  Recent numerical studies suggest that mass loading from stellar winds is a key factor in decelerating jets, accounting for many observed characteristics in FR I jets. Additionally, a radio-optical positional offset has been observed, with optical emission detected further down the jet than radio emission. This observation may challenge traditional explanations based solely on recollimation shocks and instabilities.
  This work utilizes the radiative transfer code RIPTIDE to generate synthetic synchrotron maps, from a population of re-accelerated electrons, in both radio and optical bands from jet simulations incorporating various mass-loading profiles and distributions of gas and stars within the ambient medium.
  Our findings emphasize the importance of mass entrainment in replicating the extended and diffuse radio/optical emissions observed in FR I jets and explaining the radio-optical offsets. These offsets are influenced by the galaxy's physical properties, the surrounding stellar populations, and observational biases. We successfully reproduce typical radio-optical offsets by considering a mass-load equivalent to $10^{-9}~M_\odot \cdot \rm{yr}^{-1} \cdot \rm{pc}^{-3}$. Overall, our results demonstrate that positive offset measurements are a promising tool for revealing the fundamental properties of galaxies and potentially their stellar populations, particularly in the context of FR I jets.</description>

      <title>SS433 Microquasar Jet and the TeV Resurgence beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The understanding of microquasars in our galaxy is one of the frontiers of high energy astrophysics. Their models are based on a capturing mass Black Hole, with a nearby spiraling binary companion star. The companion star mass feeds the accretion disk around the Black Hole. This energy also fuels an orthogonal precessing X gamma jets. The spiral precessing tail of such microquasars, as the SS433 system, is due to an ultra-relativistic jet, spraying nucleons and electrons at relativistic speeds. The up-down jet is observable in radio, X, gamma spectra. Its long spirals are spread and diluted within a light-year distance. The source is inside the W50 supernova remnant nebula , whose asymmetry reflects the past and present role of the SS433 jet. Very recently HESS, HAWC discovered, surprisingly at a much far disconnected distance from the SS433, the resurgence of a twin gamma beam tail. Nearly 75 years light distance far away from the same inner jet source. The recent standard model is based on an accelerating shock wave which reaccelerates, the resurgence of a PeV nucleon beam and its TeV secondaries. The surprising recollimation of this TeV beam jet is difficult to be accepted, in the assumption of a planarlike Fermi shock wave model. Here we discuss an alternative framework based on known high energy nuclear physics, capable to simultaneously explaining both the disconnected and the aligned hard TeV jet appearance. Several consequences, that might also be able to validate the model, are considered.</description>

      <title>PSR J1922+37: a 1.9-second pulsar discovered in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than 300 pulsars have been discovered in Galactic globular clusters; however, none have been found in open clusters. Here we present results from 20-hour pulsar searching observations in seven open clusters with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our first discovery is a 1.9-second pulsar (J1922+37) found in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791. The measured dispersion measure (DM) implies a distance of 4.79 kpc and 8.92 kpc based on the NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, respectively. Given the large uncertainty of DM distance estimates, it is likely that PSR J1922+37 is indeed a member of NGC 6791, for which the distance is $4.19\pm0.02$ kpc based on Gaia Data Release 3. If confirmed, PSR J1922+37 will be the first pulsar found in Galactic open clusters. We outline future observations that can confirm this pulsar-open cluster association and discuss the general prospects of finding pulsars in open clusters.</description>

      <title>Detection of extended X-ray emission around the PeVatron microquasar V4641 Sgr with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent report on the detection of very-high-energy gamma rays from V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) up to ~0.8 peta-electronvolt has made it the second confirmed "PeVatron" microquasar. Here we report on the observation of V4641 Sgr with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) in September 2024. Thanks to the large field of view and low background, the CCD imager Xtend successfully detected for the first time X-ray extended emission around V4641 Sgr with a significance of &gt; 4.5 sigma and &gt; 10 sigma based on our imaging and spectral analysis, respectively. The spatial extent is estimated to have a radius of $7 \pm 3$ arcmin ($13 \pm 5$ pc at a distance of 6.2 kpc) assuming a Gaussian-like radial distribution, which suggests that the particle acceleration site is within ~10 pc of the microquasar. If the X-ray morphology traces the diffusion of accelerated electrons, this spatial extent can be explained by either an enhanced magnetic field (~80 uG) or a suppressed diffusion coefficient (~$10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$ at 100 TeV). The integrated X-ray flux, (4-6)$\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (2-10 keV), would require a magnetic field strength higher than the galactic mean (&gt; 8 uG) if the diffuse X-ray emission originates from synchrotron radiation and the gamma-ray emission is predominantly hadronic. If the X-rays are of thermal origin, the measured extension, temperature, and plasma density can be explained by a jet with a luminosity of ~$2\times 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is comparable to the Eddington luminosity of this system.</description>

      <title>Isolated Black Holes as Potential PeVatrons and Ultrahigh-energy Gamma-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of PeV cosmic rays is a long-standing mystery, and ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray observations would play a crucial role in identifying it. Recently, LHAASO reported the discovery of ``dark'' gamma-ray sources that were detected above 100 TeV without any GeV--TeV gamma-ray counterparts. The origins of these dark gamma-ray sources are unknown. We propose isolated black holes (IBHs) wandering in molecular clouds as the origins of PeV cosmic rays and LHAASO dark sources. An IBH accretes surrounding dense gas, which forms a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around the IBH. Magnetic reconnection in the MAD can accelerate cosmic-ray protons up to PeV energies. Cosmic-ray protons of GeV-TeV energies fall to the IBH, whereas cosmic-ray protons at sub-PeV energies can escape from the MAD, providing PeV CRs into the interstellar medium. The sub-PeV cosmic-ray protons interact with the surrounding molecular clouds, producing TeV-PeV gamma rays without emitting GeV-TeV gamma rays. This scenario can explain the dark sources detected by LHAASO. Taking into account the IBH and molecular cloud distributions in our Galaxy, we demonstrate that IBHs can provide a significant contribution to the PeV cosmic rays observed on Earth. Future gamma-ray detectors in the southern sky and neutrino detectors would provide a concrete test to our scenario.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Accretion Disk and Corona During the Outburst of the Neutron Star Transient MAXI J1807+132</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass X-ray binaries with a neutron star as the primary object show a complex array of phenomenology during outbursts. The observed variability in X-ray emission primarily arises from changes in the innermost regions of the accretion disk, neutron star surface, and corona. In this work, we present the results of a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis of the neutron star transient MAXI J1807+132 during its 2023 outburst using data from the NICER observatory. The outburst is marked by a very rapid rise in the count rate by about a factor of 20 in a day. The source undergoes full state transitions and displays hysteresis effect in the hardness and rms intensity diagrams. Spectral analysis with a three-component model is consistent with disk truncation during the hard states and reaching the last stable orbit during the intermediate and soft states. We discuss the different values of the last stable radius in the context of possible distance of the source and magnetic field strength. The characteristic frequencies throughout the hard and intermediate states are found to be strongly correlated with the inner radius of the disk. Together with the spectral and fast variability properties, we attempt to trace the evolution of the size of the corona along the outburst. Following the main outburst, the source undergoes a high amplitude reflare wherein it shows a complex behavior with relatively high variability (10 %), but low hardness.</description>

      <title>Hadronic particle acceleration in the supernova remnant SN 1006 as traced by Fermi-LAT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supernova remnant SN 1006 is a source of high-energy particles detected at radio, X-rays, and tera-electronvolt gamma rays. It was also announced as a source of gamma rays by Fermi-LAT but only the north-east (NE) limb was detected at more than $5\sigma$ significance level. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT observation and a thorough morphological analysis above 1 GeV, we report the detection of the NE rim at the $6\sigma$ level and the south-west (SW) rim at the $5.5\sigma$ level using radio templates from the GLEAM survey. The spectral analysis performed between 100 MeV and 1 TeV allows the detection of a hard spectral index for the NE limb of $1.7 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$ while the emission detected in the SW is well reproduced with a steeper spectral index of $2.2 \pm 0.1 \pm 0.1$. A marginal detection (~$3\sigma$) of emission coincident with the bright north-west (NW) H$\alpha$ filament is also described with a similar spectral index of ~2.1. We successfully characterized the non-thermal multi-wavelength emission of the NE and SW limbs with a model in which inverse-Compton emission dominates in the NE while proton-proton interactions becomes significant in the SW due to the enhanced density of the medium.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method of Estimating GRB Peak Energies Beyond the \emph{Swift}/BAT Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), operating in the 15--150 keV energy band, struggles to detect the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as most GRBs have $E_{\rm p}$ values typically distributed between 200-300 keV, exceeding BAT's upper limit. To address this, we develop an innovative method to robustly estimate the lower limit of $E_{\rm p}$ for GRBs with $E_{\rm p}&gt;150$ keV. This approach relies on the intrinsic curvature of GRB spectra, which is already evident within the BAT energy range for such GRBs. By fitting BAT spectra with a cutoff power-law model and extrapolating the spectral curvature beyond BAT's range, we, therefore, can estimate the cutoff energy ($E^{'}_{\rm c}$) beyond 150 keV and the corresponding peak energy ($E^{'}_{\rm p}$). We applied this method to 17 GRBs, categorizing them into two main groups. Group I (10 bursts) maintains $\alpha$ within a typical range (from $\sim$ -0.8 to $\sim$ -1.20) with increasing $E_{\rm c}$; Group II (2 bursts) maintains $E_{\rm c}$ within a typical range (300-500 keV) but with varying $\alpha$. Our results show that for $E_{\rm c}\lesssim $1000 keV, the estimated $E^{'}_{\rm c}$ aligns well with observed values. Moreover, the reliability of $E^{'}_{\rm c}$ also depends on $\alpha$: bursts with harder $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha \gtrsim -2/3$) show reduced accuracy, while bursts with softer $\alpha$ (e.g., $\alpha \lesssim -2/3$) yield more precise estimates. In conclusion, this method is well-suited for GRB spectra with moderately observed $E_{\rm c}$ ($E_{\rm p}$) values and $\alpha$ indices that are not too hard.</description>

      <title>Hypothetical Lorentz invariance violation and the muon content of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive air showers (EAS), produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere, serve as probes of particle interactions, providing access to energies and kinematical regimes beyond the reach of laboratory experiments. Measurements from multiple cosmic-ray detectors indicate a significant, yet unexplained, discrepancy between the observed muon content in EAS and that predicted by state-of-the-art interaction models, suggesting a need for refinements in our understanding of fundamental physics. Here we show that a tiny, experimentally allowed, violation of the Lorentz invariance (LIV) may result in the suppression of the number of electrons in EAS, leaving the muon number intact and explaining both the ''muon excess'' and its energy dependence. On the other hand, we use the lack of a much stronger discrepancy between EAS data and simulations to obtain strict constraints on the LIV scale. Future experimental tests of this LIV scenario are outlined.</description>

      <title>Analytical ray-tracing of synchrotron emission around accreting black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric images of accreting black holes encode important information about laws of strong gravity and relativistic motions of matter. Recent advancements in instrumentation enabled such studies in two objects: supermassive black holes M87* and Sagittarius A*. Light coming from these sources is produced by synchrotron mechanism whose polarization is directly linked to magnetic field lines, and propagates towards the observer in a curved spacetime. We study the distortions of the gas image by the analytical ray-tracing technique for polarized light artpol, that is adapted for the case of synchrotron emission. We derive analytical expressions for fast conversion of intensity/flux, polarization degree and polarization angle from the local to observer's coordinates. We put emphasis on the non-zero matter elevation above the equatorial plane and non-circular matter motions. Applications of the developed formalism include static polarimetric imaging of the black hole vicinity and dynamic polarimetric signatures of matter close to the compact object.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Kick: Status and Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high speeds seen in rapidly rotating pulsars after supernova explosions present a longstanding puzzle in astrophysics. Numerous theories have been suggested over the years to explain this sudden "kick" imparted to the neutron star, yet each comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. Key explanations for pulsar kicks include hydrodynamic instabilities in supernovae, anisotropic neutrino emission, asymmetries in the magnetic field, binary system disruption, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Unraveling the origins of pulsar kicks not only enhances our understanding of supernova mechanisms but also opens up possibilities for exploring new physics. In this brief review, we will introduce pulsar kicks, examine the leading hypotheses, and explore future directions for this intriguing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Channels of Stellar-mass Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the basis of a large collection of detailed 3D core-collapse supernova simulations carried to late times, we identify four channels of stellar mass black hole formation. Our examples for Channel 1 involve the formation of lower-gap and above black holes in energetic asymmetric supernova explosions. Our Channel 2 example involves a modest supernova explosion that may leave behind a lower-gap to $\sim$10 $M_{\odot}$ black hole. The latter may not be easily distinguishable from ``standard" supernovae that birth neutron stars. Our Channel 3 example experiences an aborted core-collapse explosion, more often in the context of a low-metallicity progenitor, whose residue is a black hole with a mass perhaps up to $\sim$40 $M_{\odot}$. The latter may be accompanied by a pulsational-pair instability supernova (PPISN). Channel 4 is the only quiescent or ``silent" scenario for which perhaps $\sim$5 to 15 $M_{\odot}$ black holes are left. Where appropriate, we estimate $^{56}$Ni yields, explosion energies, approximate recoil speeds, and residual black hole masses. The progenitor mass density and binding energy profiles at collapse influence the outcome in a systematic way. The statistics and prevalence of these various channels depend not only on still evolving supernova theory, but on remaining issues with the theory of massive star evolution, binary interaction, wind mass loss, metallicity, and the nuclear equation of state. Importantly, we suggest, but have not proven, that the silent channel for black hole formation may not be the dominant formation modality.</description>

      <title>X-Sifter: detecting transients in X-ray data using the optimal Poisson matched filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-sifter, a software package designed for near-optimal detection of sources in X-ray images and other forms of photon images in the Poisson-noise regime. The code is based on the Poisson-noise-matched filter (Ofek &amp; Zackay), which provides an efficient method for calculating the delta log-likelihood function for source detection. The software accounts for several complexities inherent in real data, including variations in both the instrumental Point Spread Function (PSF) and background across the detector and as a function of energy. We validate the pipeline using real data with simulated source injections, as well as actual Chandra images. A comparison between the sources detected by our pipeline and those in the Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) suggests an approximate ~30% increase in the number of detected (real) sources. Near the detection limit, the reported S/N of our pipeline is approximately 1.3x higher than that of the CSC. This corresponds to a factor of 1.8 increase in survey speed.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto WD 2226$-$210, the central star of the Helix Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The central star of the Helix Nebula, WD 2226$-$210 presents enigmatic hard X-ray emission and mid-IR excess. The latter has been attributed to a dusty disk or a cloud-like structure around WD 2226$-$210 formed from material of Kuiper Belt-like or comet-like objects in highly eccentric orbits. We present here a detailed analysis of multi-epoch Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of WD 2226$-$210, comparing these to previous Einstein and ROSAT data. The luminosity of the hard X-ray component of WD 2226$-$210 has remained basically constant in the decade from 1992 to 2002, with very subtle evidence for variability in timescales of hours. Under the assumption that the X-ray emission from WD 2226$-$210 is due to accretion of material, an accretion rate of $\dot{M}\approx10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is estimated. The origin of the material accreted by WD 2226$-$210 is uncertain, and can be attributed to the disk-like structure around it or to a sub-stellar donor companion. The accretion rate proposed for the continuous replenishment by bombardment of the mid-IR-emitting structure around WD 2226$-$210 cannot match that required by the X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>3D Convective Urca Process in a Simmering White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proposed setting for thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae is a white dwarf that has gained mass from a companion to the point of carbon ignition in the core. In the early stages of carbon burning, called the simmering phase, energy released by the reactions in the core drive the formation and growth of a core convection zone. One aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, a linking of weak nuclear reactions to convection, which may alter the composition and structure of the white dwarf. The convective Urca process is not well understood and requires 3D fluid simulations to properly model the turbulent convection, an inherently 3D process. Because the neutron excess of the fluid both sets and is set by the extent of the convection zone, the realistic steady state can only be determined in simulations with real 3D mixing processes. Additionally, the convection is relatively slow (Mach number less than 0.005) and thus a low Mach number method is needed to model the flow over many convective turnovers. Using the MAESTROeX low Mach number hydrodynamic software, we present the first full star 3D simulations of the A=23 convective Urca process, spanning hundreds of convective turnover times. Our findings on the extent of mixing across the Urca shell, the characteristic velocities of the flow, the energy loss rates due to neutrino emission, and the structure of the convective boundary can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.</description>

      <title>Geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \ne -1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the energy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive gravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a wormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing horizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.</description>

      <title>Testing linear-quadratic GUP modified Kerr Black hole using EHT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear-quadratic Generalized uncertainty principle (LQG) is consistent with predictions of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum put forth by various theories of quantum gravity. The quantum gravity effect is incorporated into a black hole (BH) by modifying its ADM mass. In this article, we explore the impact of GUP on the optical properties of an LQG modified \k BH (LQKBH). We analyze the horizon structure of the BH, which reveals a critical spin value of $7M/8$. BHs with spin $(a)$ less than the critical value are possible for any real GUP parameter $\a$ value. However, as the spin increases beyond the critical value, a forbidden region in $\a$ values pops up that disallows the existence of BHs. This forbidden region widens as we increase the spin. We then examine the impact of $\a$ on the shape and size of the BH shadow for inclination angles $17^o$ and $90^o$, providing a deeper insight into the unified effect of spin and GUP on the shadow. The size of the shadow has a minimum at $\a=1.0M$, whereas, for the exact value of $\a$, the deviation of the shadow from circularity becomes maximum when the spin is less than the critical value. No extrema is observed for $a\,&gt;\, 7M/8$. The shadow's size and deviation are adversely affected by a decrease in the inclination angle. Finally, we confront theoretical predictions with observational results for supermassive BHs $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ provided by the EHT collaboration to extract bounds on the spin $a$ and GUP parameter $\a$. We explore bounds on the angular diameter $\th_d$, axial ratio $D_x$, and the deviation from \s radius $\d$ for constructing constraints on $a$ and $\a$. Our work makes LQKBHs plausible candidates for astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes of slowly-rotating Johannsen black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser interferometers has opened a new window to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the strong, dynamical, and non-linear regime. In this paper, we follow an agnostic approach and we study the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations of Johannsen black holes under the assumptions of the validity of the Einstein Equations and of low values of the black hole spin parameter and deformation parameters. We find that the deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ has a stronger impact on the quasi-normal modes than the other leading order deformation parameters ($\alpha_{22}$, $\alpha_{52}$, and $\epsilon_{3}$). We derive a fitting formula for the fundamental modes with $l=2$ and $l=3$ for the deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ valid in the slow rotation approximation ($a_* &lt; 0.4$). Finally, we constrain $\alpha_{13}$ from the event GW170104; within our analysis, we find that the data of GW170104 are consistent with the predictions of GR.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Search for Short Timescale Periodicity in Four Active Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transients with millisecond durations which typically occur at extragalactic distances. The association of FRB 20200428 with the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 strongly indicates that they could originate from neutron stars, which naturally leads to the expectation that periodicity connected with the spinning of magnetars should exist in the activities of repeating FRBs.However, previous studies have failed to find any signatures supporting such a conjecture. Here we perform a thorough search for short timescale periodicity in the four most active repeating sources, i.e. FRBs 20121102A, 20200120E, 20201124A, and 20220912A. Three different methods are employed, including the phase folding algorithm, the H-test and the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. For the three most active repeaters from which more than 1000 bursts have been detected, i.e. FRBs 20121102A, 20201124A, and 20220912A, more in-depth period searches are conducted by considering various burst properties such as the pulse width, peak flux, fluence, and the brightness temperature. No clear periodicity is found in a period range of 0.001--1000 s in all the efforts. Implications of such a null result on the theoretical models of FRBs are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The study of the entire population of SNRs in a galaxy helps us to understand the underlying stellar populations, the environments, in which the SNRs are evolving, and the stellar feedback on the ISM. The all-sky survey carried out by the extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) has provided us with spatially and spectrally resolved X-ray data of the entire Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its immediate surroundings in the soft X-ray band down to 0.2 keV. We performed a multiwavelength analysis of previously known SNR candidates and newly detected SNRs and SNR candidates. We applied the Gaussian gradient magnitude (GGM) filter to the eROSITA images of the LMC to highlight the edges of the shocked gas in order to find new SNRs. We compared the X-ray images with those of their optical and radio counterparts to investigate the true nature of the extended emission. We used the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS) for the optical data. For the radio comparison, we used data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) survey of the LMC. Using the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC) we have investigated the possible progenitors of the new SNRs and SNR candidates in our sample. We present the most updated catalogue of SNRs in the LMC. The eROSITA data have allowed us to confirm 1 of the previous SNR candidates and discover 16 new extended sources. We confirm 3 of them as new SNRs, while we propose the remaining 13 as new X-ray SNR candidates. We also present the first analysis of the follow-up XMM-Newton observation of MCSNR J0456-6533 discovered with eROSITA. Among the new candidates, we propose J0614-7251 (4eRASSU J061438.1-725112) as the first X-ray SNR candidate in the outskirts of the LMC.</description>

      <title>Detection of Diffuse Hot Gas Around the Young, Potential Superstar Cluster H72.97-69.39</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first Chandra X-ray observations of H72.97-69.39, a highly-embedded, potential super-star cluster (SSC) in its infancy located in the star-forming complex N79 of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We detect particularly hard, diffuse X-ray emission that is coincident with the young stellar objects (YSOs) identified with JWST, and the hot gas fills cavities in the dense gas mapped by ALMA. The X-ray spectra are best fit with either a thermal plasma or power-law model, and assuming the former, we show that the X-ray luminosity of L_X = (1.0 +- 0.3)e34 erg/s is a factor of ~20 below the expectation for a fully-confined wind bubble. Our results suggest that stellar wind feedback produces diffuse hot gas in the earliest stages of massive star cluster formation and that wind energy can be lost quickly via either turbulent mixing followed by radiative cooling or by physical leakage.</description>

      <title>Broadband Multi-wavelength Properties of M87 during the 2018 EHT Campaign including a Very High Energy Flaring Episode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearby elliptical galaxy M87 contains one of the only two supermassive black holes whose emission surrounding the event horizon has been imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In 2018, more than two dozen multi-wavelength (MWL) facilities (from radio to gamma-ray energies) took part in the second M87 EHT campaign. The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010. The flux above 350 GeV has more than doubled within a period of about 36 hours. We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image. Our results show the value of continued MWL monitoring together with precision imaging for addressing the origins of high-energy particle acceleration. While we cannot currently pinpoint the precise location where such acceleration takes place, the new VHE gamma-ray flare already presents a challenge to simple one-zone leptonic emission model approaches, and emphasises the need for combined image and spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>Accurate Standard Siren Cosmology with Joint Gravitational-Wave and $\gamma$-Ray Burst Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint gravitational-wave (GW) and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) observations are among the best prospects for standard siren cosmology. However, the strong selection effect for the coincident GRB detection, which is possible only for sources with small inclination angles, induces a systematic uncertainty that is currently not accounted for. We show that this severe source of bias can be removed by inferring the \emph{a priori} unknown electromagnetic detection probability directly from multimessenger data. This leads at the same time to an unbiased measurement of the Hubble constant, to constrain the properties of GRB emission, and to accurately measure the viewing angle of each source. Our inference scheme is applicable to real data already in the small-statistics regime, a scenario that might become reality in the near future. Additionally, we introduce a novel likelihood approximant for GW events which treats the dependence on distance and inclination as exact.</description>

      <title>A Series of (Net) Spin-down Glitches in PSR J1522-5735: Insights from the Vortex Creep and Vortex Bending Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through a detailed timing analysis of $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data, the rotational behavior of the $\gamma$-ray pulsar PSR J1522$-$5735 was tracked from August 2008 (MJD 54692) to January 2024 (MJD 60320). During this 15.4-year period, two over-recovery glitches and four anti-glitches were identified, marking a rare occurrence in rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs). The magnitudes of these (net) spin-down glitches were determined to be $|\Delta\nu_{\rm g}/\nu| \sim 10^{-8}$, well above the estimated detectability limit. For the two over-recovery glitches, the respective recovery fractions $Q$ are $2.1(7)$ and $1.4(2)$. Further analysis showed no substantial variations in either the flux or pulse profile shape in any of these events, suggesting that small (net) spin-down glitches, unlike large events observed in magnetars and magnetar-like RPPs, may occur without leaving an impact on the magnetosphere. Within the framework of the vortex creep and vortex bending models, anti-glitches and over-recoveries indicate the recoupling of vortex lines that moved inward as a result of a crustquake; meanwhile, the apparent fluctuations in the spin-down rate after the glitches occur as a result of the coupling of the oscillations of bent vortex lines to the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>"Bursts, Beats, and Beyond": Uncovering the landscape from accretion to ignition of 4U 1728-34 using AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive study on persistent and thermonuclear burst emission of 4U 1728-34, commonly known as 'Slow Burster' is performed using seven archival observations of AstroSat spanning from 2016-2019. The burst-free persistent spectra can be well fitted with a blackbody (bbody) and a powerlaw (powerlaw) components, with a powerlaw photon index (Gamma) was found to be ~2 indicating the source was in "high/soft" bananna state or intermediate state. The time averaged power density spectrum reveals the presence of twin kilohertz Quasi Periodic Oscillations (kHz QPOs) with centroid frequencies 619+/-10 Hz and 965+/-6 Hz with a maximum fractional root mean squared amplitude of 6.24+/-1.31% at ~16 keV. From the upper kHz QPO, we infer the magnetospheric disk radius to be ~17 km, corresponding to a magnetic field strength of 0.35-1.27 * 10^7 G. The burst spectral evolution indicates Photospheric Radius Expansion (PRE) in five bursts, yeilding a touchdown radius of 3.1-5.47 km. These bursts reached near-Eddington luminosities, through which the distance of the source was calculated to be 5.18-5.21 kpc. Two of the bursts show coherent oscillations at 362.81-363.93 Hz. The presence of twin kHz QPOs and coherent Burst Oscillations allows us to provide two different estimates for the spin frequency of the Neutron Star in the system, for the first time using AstroSat.</description>

      <title>An efficient GPU-accelerated multi-source global fit pipeline for LISA data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale analysis task of deciphering gravitational wave signals in the LISA data stream will be difficult, requiring a large amount of computational resources and extensive development of computational methods. Its high dimensionality, multiple model types, and complicated noise profile require a global fit to all parameters and input models simultaneously. In this work, we detail our global fit algorithm, called ``Erebor,'' designed to accomplish this challenging task. It is capable of analysing current state-of-the-art datasets and then growing into the future as more pieces of the pipeline are completed and added. We describe our pipeline strategy, the algorithmic setup, and the results from our analysis of the LDC2A Sangria dataset, which contains Massive Black Hole Binaries, compact Galactic Binaries, and a parameterized noise spectrum whose parameters are unknown to the user. The Erebor algorithm includes three unique and very useful contributions: GPU acceleration for enhanced computational efficiency; ensemble MCMC sampling with multiple MCMC walkers per temperature for better mixing and parallelized sample creation; and special online updates to reversible-jump (or trans-dimensional) sampling distributions to ensure sampler mixing and accurate initial estimates for detectable sources in the data. We recover posterior distributions for all 15 (6) of the injected MBHBs in the LDC2A training (hidden) dataset. We catalog $\sim12000$ Galactic Binaries ($\sim8000$ as high confidence detections) for both the training and hidden datasets. All of the sources and their posterior distributions are provided in publicly available catalogs.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution and axion-like particles: new constraints and hints from globular clusters in the GAIA DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons, natural in extensions of the Standard Model. Their interactions with ordinary matter and radiation are suppressed, making it challenging to detect them in laboratory experiments. However, these particles, produced within stellar interiors, can provide an additional mechanism for energy loss, potentially influencing stellar evolution. Prominent methods for searching for such effects involve measuring the properties of red giants and helium-burning stars in globular clusters (GCs). Here we use published catalogs of stars selected as members of seven GCs on the basis of parallaxes and proper motions measured by Gaia (Data Realease 3). Making use of previously derived theoretical relations and the new data, we find the upper limit on the ALP-electron coupling, g_{ae}&lt;5.2*10^{-14} (95% CL), and an indication (3.3 sigma) to nonzero ALP-photon coupling, g_{a\gamma}=(6.5+1.1-1.3)*10^{-11} GeV^{-1}. Given the precision of contemporary observational data, it is imperative to refine ALP constraints through more sophisticated analyses, which will be explored in detail elsewhere.</description>
