      <title>Establishment of a compensation rule between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Almond - West Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</description>

      <title>Supervised and Unsupervised protocols for hetero-associative neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a learning framework for Three-Directional Associative Memory (TAM) models, extending the classical Hebbian paradigm to both supervised and unsupervised protocols within an hetero-associative setting. These neural networks consist of three interconnected layers of binary neurons interacting via generalized Hebbian synaptic couplings that allow learning, storage and retrieval of structured triplets of patterns. By relying upon glassy statistical mechanical techniques (mainly replica theory and Guerra interpolation), we analyze the emergent computational properties of these networks, at work with random (Rademacher) datasets and at the replica-symmetric level of description: we obtain a set of self-consistency equations for the order parameters that quantify the critical dataset sizes (i.e. their thresholds for learning) and describe the retrieval performance of these networks, highlighting the differences between supervised and unsupervised protocols. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness of the captured picture about TAMs also at work with structured datasets. In particular, this study provides insights into the cooperative interplay of layers, beyond that of the neurons within the layers, with potential implications for optimal design of artificial neural network architectures.</description>

      <title>Yielding and memory in a driven mean-field model of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glassy systems reveal a wide variety of generic behaviors inherited from their intrinsically-disordered, non-equilibrium nature. These include universal non-phononic vibrational spectra, and driven phenomena such as thermal and mechanical annealing, yielding transitions and memory formation, all linked to the underlying complex energy landscape of glasses. Yet, a unified theory of such diverse glassy phenomena is currently lacking. Here, we study a recently introduced mean-field model of glasses, shown to reproduce the universal non-phononic vibrational spectra of glasses, under oscillatory driving forces. We show that the driven mean-field model, admitting a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of a collection of random-stiffness anharmonic oscillators with disordered interactions, naturally predicts the salient dynamical phenomena in cyclically deformed glasses. Specifically, it features a yielding transition as a function of the amplitude of the oscillatory driving force, characterized by an absorbing-to-diffusive transition in the system's microscopic trajectories and large-scale hysteresis. The model also reveals dynamic slowing-down from both sides of the transition, as well as mechanical and thermal annealing effects that mirror their glass counterparts. We demonstrate a non-equilibrium ensemble equivalence between the driven post-yielding dynamics at fixed quenched disorder and quenched disorder averages of the non-driven system. Finally, mechanical memory formation is demonstrated, in which memories can be stored in the model and subsequently extracted. Overall, the mean-field model offers a theoretical framework that unifies a broad range of glassy behaviors.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Getting out of a tight spot: Cooperative unclogging of hydrogel particles in disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use event-driven pore network modeling to study the transport of hydrogel particles through disordered porous media -- a process that underlies diverse applications. By simulating particle advection, deformation, and clogging at the pore scale, we identify a dimensionless "squeezing parameter" that quantitatively predicts the depth to which particles penetrate into a given medium across diverse conditions. Our simulations also uncover a surprising cooperative effect: adding more particles enables them to penetrate deeper into the medium. This phenomenon arises because individual particles redirect fluid to adjacent throats, forcing nearby particles through tight pores that they would otherwise clog. Altogether, these results help to establish a quantitative framework that connects microscopic particle mechanics to macroscopic transport behavior.</description>

      <title>Performance report of heuristic algorithm that cracked the largest Gset Ising problems (G81 cut=14060)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the past 25 years, the Gset benchmark problems have challenged all manner of Ising and Max-Cut solvers. The largest of these problems have remained unsolved by any heuristic algorithm. In this report we provide data showing dramatically better speed and accuracy on these large sparse problems. Our newly discovered heuristic algorithm called Cosm reaches high (99.9% of best) solution quality orders of magnitude faster than the previous best heuristic solver results. Additionally, when afforded enough steps Cosm attains higher cuts than ever previously reported, specifically on instances G72 (cut=7008), G77 (cut=9940), and the 20,000-variable G81 (cut=14060). This report includes solution bitstrings so that the cuts can be independently validated. Remarkably, the new best solutions appear to be optimal. We believe the results are an early hint of disruptive opportunities for unconventional, hardware-centric approaches to algorithm discovery.</description>

      <title>On the Emergence of Linear Analogies in Word Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.</description>

      <title>The universality class of the first levels in low-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of a small group of quantum states defined above the sharply defined ground state of a chaotic ensemble. This `universality class of the first levels' (UFL) is realized in the majority of `synthetic' random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au metallic alloys determined by resonant scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical study of the electronic structure and transport properties of Ni-Au alloys, recently identified as excellent thermoelectric metals with a power factor significantly exceeding that of conventional semiconductor thermoelectrics. Using first-principles calculations based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method combined with the coherent-potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and the Kubo-Greenwood formalism, we demonstrate the key role of resonant scattering in determining the thermoelectric properties of these alloys. This is supported by calculated densities of states, Bloch spectral functions, electrical conductivity, and thermopower. Alloying Ni with Au not only induces resonant scattering but also leads to the formation of a flat band below the Fermi level. The combination of these two features results in high thermopower, arising from a transition between resonant and weak scattering regimes near the Fermi level. Our findings are further compared with analogous calculations for constantan, a Ni-Cu alloy long regarded as a reference thermoelectric metal. We show that differences between the Ni-Au and Ni-Cu systems explain why Ni-Au exhibits nearly twice the thermopower of Ni-Cu. Finally, we simulate the effect of lattice parameter variation on the thermoelectric performance of Ni-Au and suggest that this is a promising pathway for further enhancement, for example through additional alloying or layer deposition.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Low Power and Fast Ising Machine using Voltage-Controlled Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired computing paradigms, such as Ising machines, are emerging as promising hardware alternatives to traditional von Neumann architectures for tackling computationally intensive combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). While quantum, optical, and electronic devices have garnered significant attention for their potential in realizing Ising machines, their translation into practical systems for industry-relevant applications remains challenging, with each approach facing specific limitations in power consumption and speed. To address this challenge, we report the first chip-level spintronic Ising machine using voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory. The core of our design leverages magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) driven by the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect to realize the probabilistic update of Ising spins through a new mechanism. It enables a latency below 1 ns and an energy consumption under 40 fJ per spin update, achieving a 1000-times improvement over previous current-driven MTJ-based implementations. We map two real-world COPs in electronic design automation-global routing and layer assignment-onto the Ising model and demonstrate high-quality results with an energy efficiency of 25000 solutions per second per watt. This outperforms state-of-the-art quantum and graphics processing units by six and seven orders of magnitude, respectively. These results establish voltage-controlled spintronics as a compelling route towards next-generation physics-inspired machine intelligence, offering a paradigm for ultra-low-power, high-speed, and scalable computation.</description>

      <title>On the transmission of texts: written cultures as complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our knowledge of past cultures relies considerably on written material. For centuries, texts have been copied, altered, then transmitted or lost - eventually, from surviving documents, philologists attempt to reconstruct text phylogenies ("stemmata"), and past written cultures. Nonetheless, fundamental questions on the extent of losses, representativeness of surviving artefacts, and the dynamics of text genealogies have remained open since the earliest days of philology. To address these, we radically rethink the study of text transmission through a complexity science approach, integrating stochastic modelling, computer simulations, and data analysis, in a parsimonious mindset akin to statistical physics and evolutionary biology. Thus, we design models that are simple and general, while accounting for diachrony and other key aspects of the dynamical process underlying text phylogenies, such as the extinction of entire branches or trees. On the well-known case study of Medieval French chivalric literature, we find that up to 60% of texts and 99% of manuscripts were lost (consistent with recent synchronic "biodiversity" analyses). We also settle a hundred-year-old controversy on the bifidity of stemmata. Further, our null model suggests that pure chance ("drift") is not the only mechanism at play, and we provide a theoretical and empirical framework for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</description>

      <title>Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of random transverse-field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground states of clusters are either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. An interesting consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, these phases are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an a posteriori justification of the assumption on the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point tacitly used in earlier works, and also refine the functional form of its vanishing at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$ asymptotically as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the time-dependent density of defects accumulated during the annealing process at intermediate times.</description>

      <title>Memorization and Generalization in Generative Diffusion under the Manifold Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the memorization and generalization capabilities of Diffusion Models (DMs) when data lies on a structured latent manifold. Specifically, we consider a set of $P$ data points in $N$ dimensions confined to a latent subspace of dimension $D = \alpha_D N$, following the Hidden Manifold Model (HMM). We analyze the reverse diffusion process using the empirical score function as a proxy, and characterize it in the high-dimensional limit $P = \exp(\alpha N)$, $N \gg 1$, by exploiting a connection with the Random Energy Model (REM). We show that a characteristic time $t_o$ marks the emergence of traps in the time-dependent potential, which however do not affect typical trajectories. The size of their basins of attraction is computed at all times. We derive the collapse time $t_c &lt; t_o$, at which trajectories fall into the basin of a training point, signaling memorization. An explicit formula for $t_c$ as a function of $P$ and $\alpha_D$ shows that the curse of dimensionality is avoided for structured data ($\alpha_D \ll 1$), even with nonlinear manifolds. We also prove that collapse corresponds to the condensation transition in the REM. Generalization is quantified via the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the exact distribution and the reverse one at time $t$. We find a distinct time $t_g &lt; t_c &lt; t_o$ minimizing this divergence. Surprisingly, the best generalization occurs inside the memorization phase. We conclude that generalization in DMs improves with data structure, as $t_g \to 0$ faster than $t_c$ when $\alpha_D \to 0$.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion for perceptron problems: statistical physics analysis and efficient algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random instances of non-convex perceptron problems in the high-dimensional limit of a large number of examples $M$ and weights $N$, with finite load $\alpha = M/N$. We develop a formalism based on replica theory to predict the fundamental limits of efficiently sampling the solution space using generative diffusion algorithms, conjectured to be saturated when the score function is provided by Approximate Message Passing. For the spherical perceptron with negative margin $\kappa$, we find that the uniform distribution over solutions can be efficiently sampled in most of the Replica Symmetric region of the $\alpha-\kappa$ plane. In contrast, for binary weights, sampling from the uniform distribution remains intractable. A theoretical analysis of this obstruction leads us to identify a potential $U(s) = -\log(s)$, under which the corresponding tilted distribution becomes efficiently samplable via diffusion. Moreover, we show numerically that an annealing procedure over the shape of this potential yields a fast and robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling the solution space of the binary perceptron.</description>

      <title>Strong Topological Trivialization of Multi-Species Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the landscapes of multi-species spherical spin glasses. Our results determine the phase boundary for annealed trivialization of the number of critical points, and establish its equivalence with a quenched strong topological trivialization property. Namely in the "trivial" regime, the number of critical points is constant, all are well-conditioned, and all approximate critical points are close to a true critical point. As a consequence, we deduce that Langevin dynamics at sufficiently low temperature has logarithmic mixing time.
  Our approach begins with the Kac--Rice formula. We characterize the annealed trivialization phase by explicitly solving a suitable multi-dimensional variational problem, obtained by simplifying certain asymptotic determinant formulas from (Ben Arous--Bourgade--McKenna 2023, McKenna 2024). To obtain more precise quenched results, we develop general purpose techniques to avoid sub-exponential correction factors and show non-existence of approximate critical points. Many of the results are new even in the 1-species case.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Quadrupole Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are an intriguing new family of topological states that host lower-dimensional boundary states. Concurrently, quasiperiodic systems have garnered significant interest due to their complex localization and topological properties. In this work we study the impact of chiral symmetry preserving quasiperiodic modulations on the paradigmatic Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model, which hosts topological insulating phases with zero-energy sublattice-polarized modes. We find that the topological properties are not only robust to the quasiperiodic modulation, but can even be enriched. In particular, we unveil the first instance of a quasiperiodic induced second-order topological insulating phase. Furthermore, in contrast with disorder, we find that quasiperiodic modulations can induce multiple reentrant topological transitions, showing an intricate sequence of localization properties. Our results open a promising avenue for exploring the rich interplay between higher-order topology and quasiperiodicity.</description>

      <title>Causality and instability in wave propagation in random time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical model to investigate wave propagation in media with random time-varying properties, where temporal fluctuations lead to complex scattering dynamics. Focusing on the ensemble-averaged field, we derive an exact expression for the average Green's function in the presence of finite temporal disorder, and extend the analysis to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast to spatial disorder, causality prevents recurrent scattering, allowing us to achieve a non-perturbative solution. We introduce an effective medium description providing a simple analysis of the propagation regimes. Our findings offer new insights into wave dynamics in temporally disordered media, with potential applications in time-varying metamaterials, dynamic sensing, and imaging in turbulent or chaotic environments.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning Phase Classification for Falicov-Kimball Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply various unsupervised machine learning methods for phase classification to investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the spinless Falicov-Kimball model in two dimensions. Using only particle occupation snapshots from Monte Carlo simulations as input, each technique, including a straightforward classification based on principal component analysis (PCA), successfully identifies the phase boundary between ordered and disordered phases, independent of the type of phase transition. Remarkably, these techniques also distinguish between the weakly localized and Anderson-localized regimes within the disordered phase, accurately identifying their crossover, which is a challenging task for standard methods. Among the machine learning approaches used, PCA based analysis outperforms more complex methods, such as neural network predictors and autoencoders. These results underscore the effectiveness of simple unsupervised techniques in examining phase transitions and electron localization in complex correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_\kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_\kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on order-disorder transitions in U(1) sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: U(1) non-linear sigma model (NLSM) with a one-dimensional (1D) Berry phase is studied by a renormalization group theory. Order-disorder transition in U(1) NLSMs in $D \!\ (\ge 2)$-dimensional space ($d+1$-dimensional spacetime; $d\ge 1$) is instigated by the proliferation of vortex excitations, where the 1D Berry phase term confers finite phase factors upon those vortex excitations that have finite projection in a subspace complementary to a topological direction with the 1D Berry phase. A destructive interference effect caused by the phase factors may help to develop an intermediate quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases, which has a divergent order-parameter correlation length along the topological direction, and a finite correlation length along the other directions. In order to explore such a possibility in $D=3$, we develop a perturbative renormalization group theory of a 3D model of vortex loops, in which loop segments interact via a $1/r$ Coulomb interaction. We derive renormalization group (RG) equations among vortex-loop fugacity, Berry phase term, and the Coulomb potential. Approximate analyses of the RG equations show that near an order-disorder transition point, vortex loops are anomalously elongated along the topological direction. Utilizing a duality mapping to a lattice model of a type-II superconductor under a magnetic field, we also argue that a global phase diagram of the 3D U(1) sigma model with 1D Berry phase must have the quasi-disorder phase between ordered and disorder phases.</description>

      <title>Super diffusive length dependent thermal conductivity in one-dimensional materials with structural defects: longitudinal to transverse phonon scattering leads to $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural defects in one-dimensional heat conductors couple longitudinal (stretching) and transverse (bending) vibrations. This coupling results in the scattering of longitudinal phonons to transverse phonons and backwards. We show that the decay rate of longitudinal phonons due to this scattering scales with their frequencies as $\omega^{3/2}$ within the long wavelength limit ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), which is more efficient scattering compared to the traditionally considered Rayleigh scattering within the longitudinal band ($\omega^2$). This scattering results in temperature independent thermal conductivity depending on the size as $\kappa \propto L^{1/3}$ for sufficiently long materials. This predicted length dependence is observed in nanowires, though the temperature dependence is seen there possibly because of deviations from pure one-dimensional behavior. The significant effect of interaction of longitudinal phonons with transverse phonons is consistent with the earlier observations of a substantial suppression of thermal energy transport by kinks, obviously leading to such interaction, though anharmonic interaction can also be significant.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Expedited thermalization dynamics in incommensurate systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states -- a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, in which hotter liquids freeze faster than colder ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian spectrum plays a critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</description>
