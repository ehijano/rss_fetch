      <title>Splitting of supervector bundles on projective superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a splitting criterion for supervector bundles over the projective superspaces $\mathbb{P}^{n|m}$. More precisely, we prove that a rank $p|q$ supervector bundle on $\mathbb{P}^{n|m}$ with vanishing intermediate cohomology is isomorphic to the direct sum of even and odd line bundles, provided that $n \geq 2$. For $n=1$ we provide an example of a supervector bundle that cannot be written as a sum of line bundles.</description>

      <title>Universal Chern classes on the moduli of bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to construct universal cohomology classes on the moduli space of stable bundles over a curve when it is not a fine moduli space, i.e. when the rank and degree are not coprime. More precisely, we show that certain Chern classes of the universal bundle on the product of the curve with the moduli stack of bundles lift to the product of the curve with the moduli space of stable bundles.</description>

      <title>On Teissier's example of an equisingularity class that cannot be defined over the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Teissier says that the cone over one of classical polygon examples in the real projective space gives, by complexification, a surface singularity with the property that is not Whitney equisingular to a singularity defined over the field of rational numbers Q. In this note we correct the example and give a complete proof of the above mentioned property.</description>

      <title>Singularities of the nested Hilbert scheme of points of length 3, 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the projection morphism $X^{[3,4]} \longrightarrow X^{[3]}$ is flat even if it has reducible fiber. After showing the rational singularities of the fiber of residual morphism $\textrm{res}_{3,4} :X^{[3,4]} \longrightarrow X$, we conclude that $X^{[3,4]}$ has canonical Gorenstein singularities. As a corollary, we specify the singularities of several nested Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay of semistable vector bundles and their restrictions on reducible curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a comb-like curve over $\mathbb{C}$, and $E$ be a vector bundle of rank $n$ on $C$. In this paper, we investigate the criteria for the semistability of the restriction of $E$ onto the components of $C$ when $E$ is given to be semistable with respect to a polarization $w$. As an application, assuming each irreducible component of $C$ is general in its moduli space, we investigate the $w$-semistability of kernel bundles on such curves, extending the results (completely for rank two and partially for higher rank) known in the case of a reducible nodal curve with two smooth components, but here, using different techniques.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles supported by small chords and compatible with natural real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have previously proposed a study of arrangements of small circles which also surround regions in the plane realized as the images of natural real algebraic maps yielding Morse-Bott functions by projections. Among studies of arrangements, families of smooth regular submanifolds in smooth manifolds, this study is fundamental, explicit, and new, surprisingly.
  We have obtained a complete list of local changes of the graphs the regions naturally collapse to in adding a (generic) small circle to an existing arrangement of the proposed class. Here, we propose a similar and essentially different class of arrangements of circles. The present study also yields real algebraic maps and nice real algebraic functions similarly and we present a similar study.
  We are interested in topological properties and combinatorics among such arrangements and regions and applications to constructing such real algebraic maps and manifolds explicitly and understanding their global structures.</description>

      <title>Characterization of polynomial surfaces of revolution and polynomial quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the polynomiality of surfaces of revolution by means of the polynomiality of an associated plane curve. In addition, if the surface of revolution is polynomial, we provide formulas for computing a polynomial parametrization, over $\mathbb{C}$, of the surface. Furthermore, we perform the first steps towards the analysis of the existence, and actual computation, of real polynomial parametrizations of surfaces of revolution. As a consequence, we give a complete picture of the real polynomiality of quadrics and we formulate a conjecture for the general case.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give some results on the birational geometry of varieties of Fano type and boundedness problems in positive characteristic, including a result ensuring that boundedness is stable under normalizations, a version of canonical bundle formula which is easier to use, and the effective birationality of certain weak Fano varieties with good singularities, which is predicted by the BAB conjecture.</description>

      <title>Poncelet pairs of a circle and parabolas from a confocal family and Painlev\'e VI equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study pairs of conics $(\mathcal{D},\mathcal{P})$, called \textit{$n$-Poncelet pairs}, such that an $n$-gon, called an \textit{$n$-Poncelet polygon}, can be inscribed into $\mathcal{D}$ and circumscribed about $\mathcal{P}$. Here $\mathcal{D}$ is a circle and $\mathcal{P}$ is a parabola from a confocal pencil $\mathcal{F}$ with the focus $F$. We prove that the circle contains $F$ if and only if every parabola $\mathcal{P}\in\mathcal{F}$ forms a $3$-Poncelet pair with the circle. We prove that the center of $\mathcal{D}$ coincides with $F$ if and only if every parabola $\mathcal{P}\in \mathcal{F}$ forms a $4$-Poncelet pair with the circle. We refer to such property, observed for $n=3$ and $n=4$, as \textit{$n$-isoperiodicity}. We prove that $\mathcal{F}$ is not $n$-isoperiodic with any circle $\mathcal{D}$ for $n$ different from $3$ and $4$. Using isoperiodicity, we construct explicit algebraic solutions to Painlev\'e VI equations.</description>

      <title>Splitting CEGM Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CEGM formalism offers a general framework for scattering amplitudes, which rests on Grassmannians, moduli spaces and tropical geometry. The physical implications of this generalization are still to be understood. Conventional wisdom says that key features of scattering amplitudes, like factorization at their poles into lower-point amplitudes, are associated to their singularities. The factorization behavior of CEGM amplitudes at their poles is interesting but complicated. Recent developments have revealed important properties of standard particle and string scattering amplitudes from factorizations, known as splits, that happen away from poles. In this paper we introduce a kinematic subspace on which the CEGM amplitude splits into very simple rational functions. These functions, called simplex amplitudes, arise from stringy integrals for the multivariate beta function, and also from restricting the biadjoint scalar amplitude in quantum field theory to certain kinematic loci. Using split kinematics we also discover a specific class of zeros of the CEGM amplitude. Our construction rests on viewing positive moduli space as a product of simplices, and it suggests a novel approach for deriving scattering amplitudes from tropical determinantal varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate alternative construction of Fitting ideals of pushforward modules $f_*\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$ for finite and holomorphic map-germs from an $n$-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay space $(X,0)$ to $(\mathbb{C}^{n+1},0)$. For corank 1 map-germs, we generalize a result of D. Mond and R. Pellikaan to iteratively calculate $k$-th Fitting ideals as ideal quotients of lower ones. We also show that for a stable map-germ of any corank, the first Fitting ideal can be calculated as a quotient ideal of the Jacobian of the image and the pushforward of the ramification ideal, which is a modification of classical result of due to Piene.</description>

      <title>Filtrations of Tope Spaces of Oriented Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare three filtrations of the tope space of an oriented matroid. The first is the dual Varchenko-Gelfand degree filtration, the second filtration is from Kalinin's spectral sequence, and the last one derives from Quillen's augmentation filtration. We show that all three filtrations and the respective maps coincide over $\mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}$.
  We also show that the dual Varchenko-Gelfand degree filtration can be made into a filtration of the $\mathbb{Z}$-sign cosheaf on the fan of the underlying matroid. This was previously carried out with $\mathbb{Z}/ 2\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients by the first author and Renaudineau using the Quillen filtration and has applications to real algebraic geometry via patchworking.</description>

      <title>Ricci-Flat Mirror Hypersurfaces in Spaces of General Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Ricci-flat (i.e., Calabi-Yau) hypersurfaces in spaces admitting a maximal (toric) $U(1)^n$ gauge symmetry of general type (encoded by certain non-convex and multi-layered multitopes) may degenerate, but can be smoothed by rational (Laurent) anticanonical sections. Nevertheless, the phases of the Gauged Linear Sigma Model and an increasing number of their classical and quantum data are just as computable as for their siblings encoded by reflexive polytopes, and they all have transposition mirror models. Showcasing such hypersurfaces in so-called Hirzebruch scrolls shows this class of constructions to be infinitely vast, yet amenable to standard and well-founded algebro-geometric methods of analysis.</description>

      <title>Gram-like matrix preserving extensions of noncommutative polynomials to sum of Hermitian Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a nonnegative noncommutative polynomial $f$, equivalently a sum of Hermitian squares (SOHS), there exists a positive semidefinite Gram matrix that encrypts all essential information of $f$. There are no available methods for extending a noncommutative polynomial to a SOHS keeping the Gram matrices unperturbed. As a remedy, we introduce an equally significant notion of Gram-like matrices and provide linear algebraic techniques to get the desired extensions. We further use positive semidefinite completion problem to get SOHS and provide criteria in terms of chordal graphs and 2-regular projective algebraic sets.</description>

Abstract: We study the Scholze test functions for bad reduction of simple Shimura varieties at a prime where the underlying local group is any inner form of a product of Weil restrictions of general linear groups. Using global methods, we prove that these test functions satisfy a vanishing property of their twisted orbital integrals, and we prove that the pseudostabilization base changes of such functions exist (even though the local group need not be quasi-split) and can be expressed in terms of explicit distributions in the stable Bernstein center. We then deduce applications to the stable trace formula and local Hasse-Weil zeta functions for these Shimura varieties.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work general conditions were given to prove the infiniteness of the genus of certain towers of function fields over a perfect field. It was shown that many examples where particular cases of those general results. In this paper the genus of a family of wild towers of function fields will be considered together with a result with less restrictive sufficient conditions for a wild tower to have infinite genus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.04945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove a $p$-adic analogue of the local invariant cycle theorem for $H^2$ in mixed characteristics. As a result, for a smooth projective variety $X$ over a $p$-adic local field $K$ with a proper flat regular model $\mathcal{X}$ over $O_K$, we show that the natural map $Br(\mathcal{X})\rightarrow Br(X_{\bar{K}})^{G_K}$ has a finite kernel and a finite cokernel. And we prove that the natural map $Hom(Br(X)/Br(K)+Br(\mathcal{X}), \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow Alb_X(K)$ has a finite kernel and a finite cokernel, generalizing Lichtenbaum's duality between Brauer groups and Jacobians for curves to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a simple way to study the isotypical components of the homology of simplicial complexes with actions of finite groups, and use it for Milnor fibers of ICIS. We study the homology of images of mappings $f_t$ that arise as deformations of complex map germs $f:(\mathbb{C}^n,S)\to(\mathbb{C}^p,0)$, with $n&lt;p$, and the behaviour of singularities (instabilities) in this context. We study two generalizations of the notion of image Milnor number $\mu_I$ given by Mond and give a workable way of compute them, in corank one, with Milnor numbers of ICIS. We also study two unexpected traits when $p&gt;n+1$: stable perturbations with contractible image and homology of $\text{im} f_t$ in unexpected dimensions. We show that Houston's conjecture, $\mu_I$ constant in a family implies excellency in Gaffney's sense, is false, but we give a correct modification of the statement of the conjecture which we also prove.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hodge standard conjecture for varieties over finite fields admitting a CM lifting, such as abelian varieties or products of K3 surfaces. For those varieties we show that the signature predicted by the conjecture holds true modulo $4$. This amounts to determining the discriminant and the Hilbert symbol of the intersection product. The first is obtained by $\ell$-adic arguments whereas the second needs a careful computation in $p$-adic Hodge theory.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the generating series of special divisors in toroidal compactifications of orthogonal Shimura varieties is a mixed mock modular form. More precisely, we find an explicit completion using theta series associated to rays in the cone decomposition. The proof relies on intersection theory at the boundary of the Shimura variety.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a quasi-compact quasi-separated $p$-adic formal scheme that is smooth either over a perfectoid $\mathbb{Z}_p$-algebra or over some ring of integers of a $p$-adic field. We construct a fully faithful functor from perfect complexes on the Hodge-Tate stack of $X$ up to isogeny to perfect complexes on the v-site of the generic fibre of $X$. Moreover, we describe perfect complexes on the Hodge-Tate stack in terms of certain derived categories of Higgs, resp. Higgs-Sen modules. This leads to a derived $p$-adic Simpson functor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14985v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subtracting a critical rank-one approximation from a matrix always results in a matrix with a lower rank. This is not true for tensors in general. Motivated by this, we ask the question: what is the closure of the set of those tensors for which subtracting some of its critical rank-one approximation from it and repeating the process we will eventually get to zero? In this article, we show how to construct this variety of tensors and we show how this is connected to the bottleneck points of the variety of rank-one tensors (and in general to the singular locus of the hyperdeterminant), and how this variety can be equal to and in some cases be more than (weakly) orthogonally decomposable tensors.</description>

Abstract: For any smooth proper rigid analytic space $X$ over a complete algebraically closed extension of $\mathbb Q_p$, we construct a $p$-adic Simpson correspondence: an equivalence of categories between vector bundles on Scholze's pro-\'etale site of $X$ and Higgs bundles on $X$. This generalises a result of Faltings from smooth projective curves to any higher dimension, and further to the rigid analytic setup. The strategy is new, and is based on the study of rigid analytic moduli spaces of pro-\'etale invertible sheaves on spectral varieties.</description>

      <title>Quantum spectrum and Gamma structures for quasi-homogeneous polynomials of general type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a quasi-homogeneous polynomial of general type and $&lt;J&gt;$ be the cyclic symmetry group of $W$ generated by the exponential grading element $J$. We study the quantum spectrum and asymptotic behavior in Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory of the Landau-Ginzburg pair $(W, &lt;J&gt;)$.
  Inspired by Galkin-Golyshev-Iritani's Gamma conjectures for quantum cohomology of Fano manifolds, we propose Gamma conjectures for Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory of general type. We prove the quantum spectrum conjecture and the Gamma conjectures for Fermat homogeneous polynomials and the mirror simple singularities.
  The Gamma structures in Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten theory also provide a bridge from the category of matrix factorizations of the Landau-Ginzburg pair (the algebraic aspect) to its analytic aspect. We will explain the relationship among the Gamma structures, Orlov's semiorthogonal decompositions, and the Stokes phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifold. We associate with any big $\mathbf{R}$-divisor $D$ on $X$ a convex polygon $\Delta_E^{\mathrm{num}}(D)$ of dimension 2, whose Euclidean volume is $\mathrm{vol}_{\mathbf{R}^2}(\Delta_E^{\mathrm{num}}(D))=q_X(P(D))/2$, where $E$ is any prime divisor on $X$, $q_X$ is the Beauville-Bogomolov-Fujiki form, and $P(D)$ is the positive part of the divisorial Zariski decomposition of $D$. We systematically study these polygons and observe that they behave like the Newton-Okounkov bodies of big divisors on smooth complex projective surfaces, with respect to a general admissible flag.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a logarithmic enhancement of the Gromov-Witten/Donaldson-Thomas correspondence, with descendants, and study its behavior under simple normal crossings degenerations. The formulation of the logarithmic correspondence requires a matching of tangency conditions with relative insertions. This is achieved via a version of the Nakajima basis for the cohomology of the Hilbert schemes of points on a logarithmic surface.
  Next, we establish a strong form of the degeneration formula in logarithmic DT theory - the numerical DT invariants of the general fiber of a degeneration are determined by the numerical DT invariants attached to strata of the special fiber. The GW version of this result, which we prove in all target dimensions, strengthens currently known formulas. A key role is played by a certain exotic class of insertions, introduced here, that impose non-local incidence conditions coupled across multiple boundary strata of the target geometry.
  Finally, we prove compatibility of the new logarithmic GW/DT correspondence with degenerations. In particular, the logarithmic conjecture for all strata of the special fiber of a degeneration implies the traditional GW/DT conjecture on the general fiber. Compatibility is a strong constraint, and can be used to calculate logarithmic DT invariants. Several examples are included to illustrate the nature and utility of the formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a very general Gushel-Mukai (GM) variety of dimension $n\geq 4$, and let $Y$ be a smooth hyperplane section. There are natural pull-back and push-forward functors between the semi-orthogonal components (known as the Kuznetsov components) of the derived categories of $X$ and $Y$. In this paper, we prove that the Bridgeland stability of objects is preserved by both pull-back and push-forward functors. We then explore various applications of this result, such as constructing an $8$-dimensional smooth family of Lagrangian subvarieties for each moduli space of stable objects in the Kuznetsov component of a general GM fourfold and proving the projectivity of the moduli spaces of semistable objects of any class in the Kuznetsov component of a general GM threefold, as conjectured by Perry, Pertusi, and Zhao.</description>

For a threefold, Pandharipande conjectured that they are equal to Gopakumar-Vafa invariants (BPS invariants) in the case of Fano classes and primitive Calabi-Yau classes. We prove the conjecture using a wall-crossing technique. This provides an algebro-geometric construction of Gopakumar-Vafa invariants in these cases.</description>

Abstract: We consider the category of modules over sheaves of Deformation-Quantization (DQ) algebras on bionic symplectic varieties. These spaces are equipped with both an elliptic $\mathbb{G}_m$-action and a Hamiltonian $\mathbb{G}_m$-action, with finitely many fixed points. On these spaces one can consider geometric category $\mathcal{O}$: the category of (holonomic) modules supported on the Lagrangian attracting set of the Hamiltonian action. We show that there exists a local generator in geometric category $\mathcal{O}$ whose dg endomorphism ring, cohomologically supported on the Lagrangian attracting set, is derived equivalent to the category of all DQ-modules. This is a version of Koszul duality generalizing the equivalence between D-modules on a smooth variety and dg-modules over the de Rham complex.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth scheme $X$ over the field $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers and a line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$ with associated topological line bundle $L=\mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R})$, we study the real cycle class map $\widetilde{\gamma}_{\mathbb{R}}:\widetilde{\mathrm{CH}}^c(X,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow\mathrm{H}^c(X(\mathbb{R}),\mathbb{Z}(L))$ from the $c$-th Chow-Witt group of $X$ to the $c$-th cohomology group of its real locus $X(\mathbb{R})$ with coefficients in the local system $\mathbb{Z}(L)$ associated with $L$. We focus on the cases $c\in\{0,d-2,d-1,d\}$ where $d$ is the dimension of $X$ and we formulate an analogue of the Hodge conjecture in terms of the exponents of the cokernel of $\widetilde{\gamma}_{\mathbb{R}}$ that is corroborated by the results obtained in those codimensions.</description>

Abstract: We suggest a general framework for compactifing quasi-projective Lagrangian fibrations of geometric origin by holomorphic symplectic varieties. This framework includes a compactification criterion, which we then apply to various fibrations of geometric origin, and a discussion on holomorphic forms that are defined via correspondences in geometric examples. As application, we show that given a Lagrangian fibration $X \to B$ admitting local sections over an open subset $V$ with codimension $\ge 2$ complement, there exists a (possibly singular) holomorphic symplectic compactification of the Albanese fibration $A \to V$ (which we show exists as a smooth commutative algebraic group with connected fibers acting on $X_{V}$), as well as of any other torsor over $A$, or over any smooth commutative group scheme over $B$ with connected fibers that is isogenous to $A$.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. We have studied local changes of the graphs in adding these circles. These graphs are essentially so-called {\it Reeb graphs} of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\pi\colon Y \to X$ be a branched cover of complex algebraic curves of respective genera $g(Y)=2$ and $g(X)=1$. The Jacobian of $Y$ is isogenous to the product of two elliptic curves: $\operatorname{Jac} Y \sim \operatorname{Jac} X \times \operatorname{Jac} W$. We present an explicit geometric construction of the complementary curve $W$. Furthermore, we establish a criterion to decide whether an algebraic correspondence of curves admits a push-out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_b$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus $b$. We investigate finite quotients $G$ of the pure braid group on two strands $\mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b)$ which do not factor through $\pi_1(\Sigma_b \times \Sigma_b)$. Building on our previous work on some special systems of generators on finite groups that we called \emph{diagonal double Kodaira structures}, we prove that, if $G$ has not order $32$, then $|G| \geq 64$, and we completely classify the cases where equality holds. In the last section, as a geometric application of our algebraic results, we construct two $3$-dimensional families of double Kodaira fibrations having the same biregular invariants and the same Betti numbers but different fundamental group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the noncommutative singularity theory of the double $A_n$ quiver $Q_n$ (with a single loop at each vertex), with applications to algebraic geometry and representation theory. We give various intrinsic definitions of a Type A potential on $Q_n$, then via coordinate changes we (1) prove a monomialization result that expresses these potentials in a particularly nice form, (2) prove that Type A potentials precisely correspond to crepant resolutions of cAn singularities, (3) solve the Realisation Conjecture of Brown-Wemyss in this setting.
  For $n \leq 3$, we furthermore give a full classification of Type A potentials (without loops) up to isomorphism, and those with finite-dimensional Jacobi algebras up to derived equivalence. There are various algebraic corollaries, including to certain tame algebras of quaternion type due to Erdmann, where we describe all basic algebras in the derived equivalence class.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the existence of a divisor of degree $3$ and Baker-Norine rank at least $1$ on a $3$-edge connected tropical curve is equivalent to the existence of a non-degenerate harmonic morphism of degree $3$ from a tropical modification of it to a tropical rational curve. Using the second description, we define the moduli spaces of $3$-edge connected tropical trigonal covers and of $3$-edge connected tropical trigonal curves, the latter as a locus in the moduli space of tropical curves. Finally, we prove that the moduli space of $3$-edge connected genus $g$ tropical trigonal curves has the same dimension as the moduli space of genus $g$ algebraic trigonal curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-slope stability of sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big cohomology class. We also define the notion of a $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric for sheaves in terms of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current $T$. The first main theorem establishes the invariance of these notions under bimeromorphic transformations that are compositions of proper bimeromorphic maps and bimeromorphic morphisms isomorphic in codimension 1. The second main theorem proves the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence with respect to the canonical divisor on a projective variety of general type. We also discuss the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality for $\alpha$-slope sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big and nef class</description>

Abstract: We construct Adams operations on the cohomology theory Tmf of topological modular forms; the first such stable operations on this cohomology theory. These Adams operations are then calculated on the Tmf-cohomology of spheres using a combination of descent spectral sequences and Anderson duality. Applications of these operations are then given, including constructions of connective height 2 analogues of Adams summands and image of J spectra.</description>

Abstract: Discrete signatures are invariants computed from time series corresponding to the discretised version of the signature of paths. We study the algebraic varieties arising from their images, the discrete signature varieties. We introduce them and compute their dimension in many cases. From a particular subclass of these varieties, we derive a partial solution to the Chen-Chow theorem for complex-valued time series.</description>

      <title>On combinatorics of string polytopes in types $B$ and $C$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A string polytope is a rational convex polytope whose lattice points parametrize a highest weight crystal basis, which is obtained from a string cone by explicit affine inequalities depending on a highest weight. It also inherits geometric information of a flag variety such as toric degenerations, Newton-Okounkov bodies, mirror symmetry, Schubert calculus, and so on. In this paper, we study combinatorial properties of string polytopes in types $B$ and $C$ by giving an explicit description of string cones in these types which is analogous to Gleizer-Postnikov's description of string cones in type $A$. As an application, we characterize string polytopes in type $C$ which are unimodularly equivalent to the Gelfand-Tsetlin polytope in type $C$ for a specific highest weight.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new concept of logarithmic topological recursion that provides a patch to topological recursion in the presence of logarithmic singularities and prove that this new definition satisfies the universal $x-y$ swap relation. This result provides a vast generalization and a proof of a very recent conjecture of Hock. It also uniformly explains (and conceptually rectifies) an approach to the formulas for the $n$-point functions proposed by Hock.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the algebra of functions on the cotangent bundle $T^*(G/U_P)$ of the parabolic base affine space for a reductive group $G$ and a parabolic subgroup $P$ is isomorphic to the subalgebra of the functions on $G \times L \times \mathfrak{l}//L$ which are invariant under a certain action of the group scheme of universal centralizers on $G$, where $L$ is a Levi subgroup of $P$ and $\mathfrak{l}$ is its Lie algebra, upgrading an isomorphism of Ginzburg and Kazhdan simultaneously to the parabolic and the modular setting. We also derive a related isomorphism for the partial Whittaker cotangent bundle of $G$, which proves a conjecture of Devalapurkar.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a combinatorial rule satisfied by the signs of principal minors of a real symmetric matrix. The sign patterns satisfying this rule are equivalent to uniform oriented Lagrangian matroids. We first discuss their structure and symmetries and then study their asymptotics, proving that almost all of them are not representable by real symmetric matrices. We offer several conjectures and experimental results concerning representable sign patterns and the topology of their representation spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the families of bialgebras or Hopf algebras over fields for which the product in the corresponding category is finite-dimensional, answering a question of M. Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then bialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors are, with at most one of dimension $&gt;1$; over finite fields the necessary and sufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most finitely many of dimension $&gt;1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras as well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field extensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor preserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an error in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which finite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c) again algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree coalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.</description>

Our approach here does not depend on the Riemann hypothesis for the so-called a-invariant in rank n&gt;2 even for the Sato-Tate law, rather, on a much refined structure, a similar version of which was already observed by Zagier and the senior author when the rank n Riemann hypothesis was established. Namely, instead of the rank n Riemann hypothesis bounds, we use much stronger asymptotic bounds. Accordingly, rank n Sato-Tate law can be established and rank n murmuration can be formulated equally well, similar to the corresponding structures in the abelian framework for Artin zetas of elliptic curves.</description>
