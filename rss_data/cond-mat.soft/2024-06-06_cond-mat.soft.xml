      <title>Neural force functional for non-equilibrium many-body colloidal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine power functional theory and machine learning to study non-equilibrium overdamped many-body systems of colloidal particles at the level of one-body fields. We first sample in steady state the one-body fields relevant for the dynamics from computer simulations of Brownian particles under the influence of randomly generated external fields. A neural network is then trained with this data to represent locally in space the formally exact functional mapping from the one-body density and velocity profiles to the one-body internal force field. The trained network is used to analyse the non-equilibrium superadiabatic force field and the transport coefficients such as shear and bulk viscosities. Due to the local learning approach, the network can be applied to systems much larger than the original simulation box in which the one-body fields are sampled. Complemented with the exact non-equilibrium one-body force balance equation and a continuity equation, the network yields viable predictions of the dynamics in time-dependent situations. Even though training is based on steady states only, the predicted dynamics is in good agreement with simulation results. A neural dynamical density functional theory can be straightforwardly implemented as a limiting case in which the internal force field is that of an equilibrium system. The framework is general and directly applicable to other many-body systems of interacting particles following Brownian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven discovery of self-similarity using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding self-similarity is a key step for understanding the governing law behind complex physical phenomena. Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a general FJC polyelectrolyte model with up to Next Nearest Neighbour Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a polyelectrolyte (PE) model based on a freely jointed chain (FJC) in which the beads are ionizable and the bonds are rigid. Electrostatic interactions considered are of the short range type up to next-nearest neighbours using a Debye-H\"uckel (DH) potential. Exact expressions for the conformational and protonation properties are obtained as a function of the pH using the transfer matrix method and the integration of the angular variables. For the finite cases with low N values, relevant differences arise on both the protonation curve and the end to end distance due to the end effects. However, when increasing N a rather rapid convergence is observed to the infinite chain limiting case.</description>

      <title>Controlling wall particle interactions with activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the effective forces on hard disks near walls embedded inside active nematic liquid crystals. When the disks are sufficiently close to the wall and the flows are sufficiently slow, we can obtain exact expressions for the effective forces. We find these forces and the dynamics of disks near the wall depend both on the properties of the active nematic and on the anchoring conditions on the disks and the wall. Our results show that the presence of active stresses attract planar anchored disks to walls if the activity is extensile, and repel them if contractile. For normal anchored disks the reverse is true; they are attracted in contractile systems, and repelled in extensile ones.</description>

      <title>Topological phases in discrete stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support edge states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1d and 2d systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems or in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <title>Drop Impact Dynamics of Complex Fluids: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of fluid drops on solid substrates has widespread interest in many industrial coating and spraying applications, such as ink-jet printing and agricultural pesticide sprays. Many of the fluids used in these applications are non-Newtonian, that is they contain particulate or polymeric additives that strongly modify their flow behaviour. While a large body of experimental and theoretical work has been done to understand the impact dynamics of Newtonian fluids, we as a community have much progress to make to understand how these dynamics are modified when the impact fluid has non-Newtonian rheology. In this review, we outline recent experimental, theoretical, and computational advances in the study of impact dynamics of complex fluids on solid surfaces. Here, we provide an overview of this field that is geared towards a multidisciplinary audience. Our discussion is segmented by two principal material constitutions: polymeric fluids and particulate suspensions. Throughout, we highlight promising future directions, as well as ongoing experimental and theoretical challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>A methodology of quantifying membrane permeability based on returning probability theory and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach to estimate the permeability coefficient of substrates (permeants) for crossing membranes from donor (D) phase to acceptor (A) phase by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A fundamental aspect of our approach involves reformulating the returning probability (RP) theory, a rigorous bimolecular reaction theory, to describe permeation phenomena. This reformulation relies on the parallelism between permeation and bimolecular reaction processes. In the present method, the permeability coefficient is represented in terms of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities for the reactive (R) phase that exists within the inner region of membranes. One can evaluate these quantities using multiple MD trajectories starting from phase R. We apply the RP theory to the permeation of ethanol and methylamine at different concentrations (infinitely dilute and 1 mol% conditions of permeants). Under the 1 mol% condition, the present method yields a larger permeability coefficient for ethanol ($0.12 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$) than for methylamine ($0.069\pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$), while the values of the permeability coefficient are satisfactorily close to those obtained from the brute-force MD simulations [$0.18\pm 0.03 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ and $0.052 \pm 0.005 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ for ethanol and methylamine, respectively]. Moreover, upon analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the permeability, we clarify that a higher concentration dependency of permeability for ethanol, as compared to methylamine, arises from the sensitive nature of ethanol's free-energy barrier within the inner region of the membrane against ethanol concentration.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes the escape transitions.</description>

      <title>Resetting as a swift equilibration protocol in an anharmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and characterize a method to accelerate the relaxation of a Brownian object between two distinct equilibrium states. Instead of relying on a deterministic time-dependent control parameter, we use stochastic resetting to guide and accelerate the transient evolution. The protocol is investigated numerically, and its thermodynamic cost is evaluated with the tools of stochastic thermodynamics. Remarkably, we show that stochastic resetting significantly accelerates the relaxation to the final state. This stochastic protocol exhibits energetic and temporal characteristics that align with the scales observed in previously investigated deterministic protocols. Moreover, it expands the spectrum of stationary states that can be manipulated, incorporating new potential profiles achievable through experimentally viable protocols.</description>
