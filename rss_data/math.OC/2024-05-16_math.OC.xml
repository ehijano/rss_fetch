      <title>Global weight optimization of frame structures under free-vibration eigenvalue constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimizing the weight in topology optimization of frame structures under free-vibration eigenvalue constraints constitutes a challenging nonconvex polynomial optimization problem with strong singularities in the feasible set. Here, we adopt a nonlinear semidefinite programming formulation, which consists of a minimization of a linear function over a basic semi-algebraic feasible set, and provide its bilevel reformulation. This bilevel program maintains a special structure: The lower level is univariate and quasiconvex, and the upper level is enumerative. After deriving the sufficient and necessary conditions for the solvability of the lower-level problem, we provide a way to construct feasible points to the original semidefinite program, and using such a feasible point, we show that the conditions for convergence of the Lasserre hierarchy are met. Moreover, we show how to construct lower and upper bounds for each level of the Lasserre hierarchy. Using these bounds, we develop a simple sufficient condition of global {\epsilon}-optimality. Finally, we prove that the optimality gap {\epsilon} converges to zero in the limit if the set of global minimizers is convex. We demonstrate these results with three representative problems, for which the hierarchy indeed converges in a finite number of steps.</description>

      <title>On the Characteristics of the Conjugate Function Enabling Effective Dual Decomposition Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a novel characteristic of the conjugate function associated to a generic convex optimization problem which can subsequently be leveraged for efficient dual decomposition methods. In particular, under mild assumptions, we show a specific region of the domain of the conjugate function where there is always a ray originating from any point of the region such that the gradients of the conjugate remain constant along the ray. We refer to this characteristic as a fixed gradient over rays (FGOR). We further show that the dual function inherits from the conjugate the characteristic of FGOR. Then we provide a thorough exposition of applying the FGOR characteristic to dual subgradient methods. More importantly, we leverage FGOR to devise a simple stepsize rule that can be prepended with state-of-the-art stepsize methods enabling them to be more efficient. Furthermore, we investigate how the characteristic of FGOR is used when solving the global consensus problem. We show that FGOR can be exploited not only to expedite the convergence of the dual decomposition methods but also to reduce the communication overhead when distributed implementations are sought. Numerical experiments using quadratic objectives and a regularized linear regression with a real data set are conducted to compare the practical performance of FGOR with state-of-the-art stepsize methods. Results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the convergence of existing methods while saving a considerable amount of communication overhead.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of perturbed sweeping processes with applications to general robotics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper primarily focuses on the practical applications of optimal control theory for perturbed sweeping processes within the realm of robotics dynamics. By describing these models as controlled sweeping processes with pointwise control and state constraints and by employing necessary optimality conditions for such systems, we formulate optimal control problems suitable to these models and develop numerical algorithms for their solving. Subsequently, we use the Python Dynamic Optimization library GEKKO to simulate solutions to the posed robotics problems in the case of any fixed number of robots under different initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of a zeroth-order scheme for minimising Polyak-\L{}ojasewicz (PL) functions is considered. The framework is based on exploiting a random oracle to estimate the function gradient. The convergence of the algorithm to a global minimum in the unconstrained case and to a neighbourhood of the global minimum in the constrained case along with their corresponding complexity bounds are presented. The theoretical results are demonstrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A Linear Test for Global Nonlinear Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that if a nonlinear control affine system without drift is bracket generating, then its associated sub-Laplacian is invertible under some conditions on the domain. In this note, we investigate the converse. We show how invertibility of the sub-Laplacian operator implies a weaker form of controllability, where the reachable sets of a neighborhood of a point have full measure. From a computational point of view, one can then use the spectral gap of the (infinite-dimensional) self-adjoint operator to define a notion of degree of controllability.
  An essential tool to establish the converse result is to use the relation between invertibility of the sub-Laplacian to the the controllability of the corresponding continuity equation using possibly non-smooth controls. Then using Ambrosio-Gigli-Savare's superposition principle from optimal transport theory we relate it to controllability properties of the control system. While the proof can be considered of the Perron-Frobenius type, we also provide a second dual Koopman point of view.</description>

      <title>On Convergence of the Iteratively Preconditioned Gradient-Descent (IPG) Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the observer design problem for discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems with sampled measurement data. Earlier, the recently proposed Iteratively Preconditioned Gradient-Descent (IPG) observer, a Newton-type observer, has been empirically shown to have improved robustness against measurement noise than the prominent nonlinear observers, a property that other Newton-type observers lack. However, no theoretical guarantees on the convergence of the IPG observer were provided. This paper presents a rigorous convergence analysis of the IPG observer for a class of nonlinear systems in deterministic settings, proving its local linear convergence to the actual trajectory. Our assumptions are standard in the existing literature of Newton-type observers, and the analysis further confirms the relation of the IPG observer with the Newton observer, which was only hypothesized earlier.</description>

      <title>A Primal-Dual Framework for Symmetric Cone Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a primal-dual algorithmic framework for solving Symmetric Cone Programs (SCPs), a versatile optimization model that unifies and extends Linear, Second-Order Cone (SOCP), and Semidefinite Programming (SDP). Our work generalizes the primal-dual framework for SDPs introduced by Arora and Kale, leveraging a recent extension of the Multiplicative Weights Update method (MWU) to symmetric cones. Going beyond existing works, our framework can handle SOCPs and mixed SCPs, exhibits nearly linear time complexity, and can be effectively parallelized. To illustrate the efficacy of our framework, we employ it to develop approximation algorithms for two geometric optimization problems: the Smallest Enclosing Sphere problem and the Support Vector Machine problem. Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that the two algorithms compute approximate solutions in nearly linear running time and with parallel depth scaling polylogarithmically with the input size. We compare our algorithms against CGAL as well as interior point solvers applied to these problems. Experiments show that our algorithms are highly efficient when implemented on a CPU and achieve substantial speedups when parallelized on a GPU, allowing us to solve large-scale instances of these problems.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Measures in Nonsmooth Dynamical Systems: Formalisms and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops mathematical formalisms and provides numerical methods for studying the evolution of measures in nonsmooth dynamical systems using the continuity equation. The nonsmooth dynamical system is described by an evolution variational inequality and we derive the continuity equation associated with this system class using three different formalisms. The first formalism consists of using the {superposition principle} to describe the continuity equation for a measure that disintegrates into a probability measure supported on the set of vector fields and another measure representing the distribution of system trajectories at each time instant. The second formalism is based on the regularization of the nonsmooth vector field and describing the measure as the limit of a sequence of measures associated with the regularization parameter. In doing so, we obtain quantitative bounds on the Wasserstein metric between measure solutions of the regularized vector field and the limiting measure associated with the nonsmooth vector field. The third formalism uses a time-stepping algorithm to model a  time-discretized evolution of the measures and show that the absolutely continuous trajectories associated with the continuity equation are recovered in the limit as the sampling time goes to zero. We also validate each formalism with numerical examples. For the first formalism, we use polynomial optimization techniques and the moment-SOS hierarchy to obtain approximate moments of the measures. For the second formalism, we illustrate the bounds on the Wasserstein metric for an academic example for which the closed-form expression of the Wasserstein metric can be calculated. For the third formalism, we illustrate the  time-stepping based algorithm for measure evolution on an example that shows the effect of the concentration of measures.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Error Bounds in Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Gaussian Processes via Parameter-Varying Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilized the Gaussian Processes (GPs) regression framework to establish stochastic error bounds between the actual and predicted state evolution of nonlinear systems. These systems are embedded in the linear parameter-varying (LPV) formulation and controlled using model predictive control (MPC). Our main focus is quantifying the uncertainty of the LPVMPC framework's forward error resulting from scheduling signal estimation mismatch. We compared our stochastic approach with a recent deterministic approach and observed improvements in conservatism and robustness. To validate our analysis and method, we solved the regulator problem of an unbalanced disk.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Sign Symmetries in Minimizing Sums of Rational Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the problem of minimizing a sum of rational functions over a basic semialgebraic set. We provide a hierarchy of sum of squares (SOS) relaxations that is dual to the generalized moment problem approach due to Bugarin, Henrion, and Lasserre. The investigation of the dual SOS aspect offers two benefits: 1) it allows us to conduct a convergence rate analysis for the hierarchy; 2) it leads to a sign symmetry adapted hierarchy consisting of block-diagonal semidefinite relaxations. When the problem possesses correlative sparsity as well as sign symmetries, we propose sparse semidefinite relaxations by exploiting both structures. Various numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. Finally, an application to maximizing sums of generalized Rayleigh quotients is presented.</description>

Abstract: Synchrotron light source storage rings aim to maintain a continuous beam current without observable beam motion during injection. One element that paves the way to this target is the non-linear kicker (NLK). The field distribution it generates poses challenges for optimising the topping-up operation. Within this study, a reinforcement learning agent was developed and trained to optimise the NLK operation parameters. We present the models employed, the optimisation process, and the achieved results.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Sensor Network Design for Multiple Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor placement optimization methods have been studied extensively. They can be applied to a wide range of applications, including surveillance of known environments, optimal locations for 5G towers, and placement of missile defense systems. However, few works explore the robustness and efficiency of the resulting sensor network concerning sensor failure or adversarial attacks. This paper addresses this issue by optimizing for the least number of sensors to achieve multiple coverage of non-simply connected domains by a prescribed number of sensors. We introduce a new objective function for the greedy (next-best-view) algorithm to design efficient and robust sensor networks and derive theoretical bounds on the network's optimality. We further introduce a Deep Learning model to accelerate the algorithm for near real-time computations. The Deep Learning model requires the generation of training examples. Correspondingly, we show that understanding the geometric properties of the training data set provides important insights into the performance and training process of deep learning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple parallel version of the greedy approach using a simpler objective can be highly competitive.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal QAOA protocol: Evidence of quantum advantage in solving combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). In this algorithm, there are alternating layers consisting of a mixer and a problem Hamiltonian. Each layer $i=0,\ldots,p-1$ is parameterized by $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$. How to find these parameters has been an open question with the majority of the research focused on finding them using classical algorithms. In this work, we present evidence that fixed linear ramp schedules constitute a universal set of QAOA parameters, i.e., a set of $\gamma$ and $\beta$ parameters that rapidly approximate the optimal solution, $x^*$, independently of the COP selected, and that the success probability of finding it, $probability(x^*)$, increases with the number of QAOA layers $p$. We simulate linear ramp QAOA protocols (LR-QAOA) involving up to $N_q=42$ qubits and $p = 400$ layers on random instances of 9 different COPs. The results suggest that $probability(x^*) \approx 1/2^{(\eta N_q / p)}$ for a constant $\eta$. For example, when implementing LR-QAOA with $p=42$, the $probability(x^*)$ for 42-qubit Weighted MaxCut problems (W-MaxCut) increases from $2/2^{42}\approx 10^{-13}$ to an average of 0.13. We compare LR-QAOA, simulated annealing (SA), and branch-and-bound (B\&amp;B) finding a fundamental improvement in LR-QAOA. We test LR-QAOA on real hardware using IonQ Aria, Quantinuum H2-1, IBM Brisbane, IBM Kyoto, and IBM Osaka, encoding random weighted MaxCut (W-MaxCut) problems from 5 to 109 qubits and $p=3$ to $100$. Even for the largest case, $N_q=109$ qubits and $p=100$, information about the LR-QAOA optimization protocol is present. The circuit involved requires 21200 CNOT gates. These results show that LR-QAOA effectively finds high-quality solutions for COPs and suggests an advantage of quantum computation for combinatorial optimization in the near future.</description>

Abstract: -Recent strides in model predictive control (MPC)underscore a dependence on numerical advancements to efficientlyand accurately solve large-scale problems. Given the substantialnumber of variables characterizing typical whole-body optimalcontrol (OC) problems -often numbering in the thousands-exploiting the sparse structure of the numerical problem becomescrucial to meet computational demands, typically in the range ofa few milliseconds. A fundamental building block for computingNewton or Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) steps indirect optimal control methods involves addressing the linearquadratic regulator (LQR) problem. This paper concentrateson equality-constrained problems featuring implicit systemdynamics and dual regularization, a characteristic found inadvanced interior-point or augmented Lagrangian solvers. Here,we introduce a parallel algorithm designed for solving an LQRproblem with dual regularization. Leveraging a rewriting of theLQR recursion through block elimination, we first enhanced theefficiency of the serial algorithm, then subsequently generalized itto handle parametric problems. This extension enables us to splitdecision variables and solve multiple subproblems concurrently.Our algorithm is implemented in our nonlinear numerical optimalcontrol library ALIGATOR. It showcases improved performanceover previous serial formulations and we validate its efficacy bydeploying it in the model predictive control of a real quadrupedrobot. This paper follows up from our prior work on augmentedLagrangian methods for numerical optimal control with implicitdynamics and constraints.</description>

      <title>All convex bodies are in the subdifferential of some everywhere differentiable locally Lipschitz function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a differentiable locally Lipschitz function $f$ in $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ with the property that for every convex body $K\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ there exists $\bar x \in \mathbb{R}^N$  such that $K$ coincides with the set $\partial_L f(\bar x)$ of limits of derivatives $\{Df(x_n)\}_{n\geq 1}$ of sequences $\{x_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ converging to~$\bar x$. The technique can be further refined to recover all compact connected subsets with nonempty interior, disclosing an important difference between differentiable and continuously differentiable functions. It stems out from our approach that the class of these pathological functions contains an infinite dimensional vector space and is dense in the space of all locally Lipschitz functions for the uniform convergence.</description>

      <title>Fair Generalized Linear Mixed Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When using machine learning for automated prediction, it is important to account for fairness in the prediction. Fairness in machine learning aims to ensure that biases in the data and model inaccuracies do not lead to discriminatory decisions. E.g., predictions from fair machine learning models should not discriminate against sensitive variables such as sexual orientation and ethnicity. The training data often in obtained from social surveys. In social surveys, oftentimes the data collection process is a strata sampling, e.g. due to cost restrictions. In strata samples, the assumption of independence between the observation is not fulfilled. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the strata correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the strata assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present in this paper an algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously, and we demonstrate the impact of stratified sampling on the quality of fair machine learning predictions in a reproducible simulation study.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Online Convex Optimization with Adversarial Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-studied generalization of the standard online convex optimization (OCO) is constrained online convex optimization (COCO). In COCO, on every round, a convex cost function and a convex constraint function are revealed to the learner after the action for that round is chosen. The objective is to design an online policy that simultaneously achieves a small regret while ensuring small cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary. A long-standing open question in COCO is whether an online policy can simultaneously achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(\sqrt{T})$ CCV without any restrictive assumptions. For the first time, we answer this in the affirmative and show that an online policy can simultaneously achieve $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ CCV. We establish this result by effectively combining the adaptive regret bound of the AdaGrad algorithm with Lyapunov optimization - a classic tool from control theory. Surprisingly, the analysis is short and elegant.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-price with novel cuts, and a new Stackelberg Security Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anticipating the strategies of potential attackers is crucial for protecting critical infrastructure. We can represent the challenge of the defenders of such infrastructure as a Stackelberg security game. The defender must decide how to allocate limited resources to protect specific targets, aiming to maximize their expected utility (such as minimizing the extent of damage) and considering that attackers will respond in a way that is most advantageous to them.
  We present novel valid inequalities to find a Strong Stackelberg Equilibrium in both Stackelberg games and Stackelberg security games. We also consider a Stackelberg security game that aims to protect targets with a defined budget. We use branch-and-price in this game to show that our approach outperforms the standard formulation in the literature, and we conduct an extensive computational study to analyze the impact of various branch-and-price parameters on the performance of our method in different game settings.</description>

      <title>On identifying the non-linear dynamics of a hovercraft using an end-to-end deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the identification of the non-linear dynamics of a novel hovercraft design, employing end-to-end deep learning techniques. Our experimental setup consists of a hovercraft propelled by racing drone propellers mounted on a lightweight foam base, allowing it to float and be controlled freely on an air hockey table. We learn parametrized physics-inspired non-linear models directly from data trajectories, leveraging gradient-based optimization techniques prevalent in machine learning research. The chosen model structure allows us to control the position of the hovercraft precisely on the air hockey table. We then analyze the prediction performance and demonstrate the closed-loop control performance on the real system.</description>

      <title>Globally Optimal Solutions to a Class of Fractional Optimization Problems Based on Proximal Gradient Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a category of constrained fractional optimization problems that emerge in various practical applications. The objective function for this category is characterized by the ratio of a numerator and denominator, both being convex, semi-algebraic, Lipschitz continuous, and differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradients over the constraint sets. The constrained sets associated with these problems are closed, convex, and semi-algebraic. We propose an efficient algorithm that is inspired by the proximal gradient method, and we provide a thorough convergence analysis. Our algorithm offers several benefits compared to existing methods. It requires only a single proximal gradient operation per iteration, thus avoiding the complicated inner-loop concave maximization usually required. Additionally, our method converges to a critical point without the typical need for a nonnegative numerator, and this critical point becomes a globally optimal solution with an appropriate condition. Our approach is adaptable to unbounded constraint sets as well. Therefore, our approach is viable for many more practical models. Numerical experiments show that our method not only reliably reaches ground-truth solutions in some model problems but also outperforms several existing methods in maximizing the Sharpe ratio with real-world financial data.</description>

      <title>Local properties and augmented Lagrangians in fully nonconvex composite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broad class of optimization problems can be cast in composite form, that is, considering the minimization of the composition of a lower semicontinuous function with a differentiable mapping. This paper investigates the versatile template of composite optimization without any convexity assumptions. First- and second-order optimality conditions are discussed. We highlight the difficulties that stem from the lack of convexity when dealing with necessary conditions in a Lagrangian framework and when considering error bounds. Building upon these characterizations, a local convergence analysis is delineated for a recently developed augmented Lagrangian method, deriving rates of convergence in the fully nonconvex setting.</description>

      <title>A Paradox of Telecommuting and Staggered Work Hours in the Bottleneck Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long- and short-term effects of telecommuting (TLC), staggered work hours (SWH), and their combined scheme on peak-period congestion and location patterns. In order to enable a unified comparison of the schemes' long- and short-term effects, we develop a novel equilibrium analysis approach that consistently synthesizes the long-term equilibrium (location and percentage of telecommuting choice) and short-term equilibrium (preferred arrival time and departure time choice). By exploiting their special mathematical structures similar to optimal transport problems, we derive the closed-form solution to the long- and short-term equilibrium while explicitly considering their interaction. These closed-form solutions elucidate the discrepancies between the effects of each scheme and uncover a paradoxical finding: the introduction of SWH, in conjunction with TLC, may increase the total commuting costs compared to the scenario with only TLC, without yielding any improvement in worker utility.</description>

      <title>Mirror Duality in Convex Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While first-order optimization methods are usually designed to efficiently reduce the function value $f(x)$, there has been recent interest in methods efficiently reducing the magnitude of $\nabla f(x)$, and the findings show that the two types of methods exhibit a certain symmetry. In this work, we present mirror duality, a one-to-one correspondence between mirror-descent-type methods reducing function value and reducing gradient magnitude. Using mirror duality, we obtain the dual accelerated mirror descent (dual-AMD) method that efficiently reduces $\psi^*(\nabla f(x))$, where $\psi$ is a distance-generating function and $\psi^*$ quantifies the magnitude of $\nabla f(x)$. We then apply dual-AMD to efficiently reduce $\|\nabla f(\cdot) \|_q$ for $q\in [2,\infty)$ and to efficiently compute $\varepsilon$-approximate solutions of the optimal transport problem.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive first order methods: proximal gradient and alternating minimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon recent works on linesearch-free adaptive proximal gradient methods, this paper proposes adaPG$^{q,r}$, a framework that unifies and extends existing results by providing larger stepsize policies and improved lower bounds. Different choices of the parameters $q$ and $r$ are discussed and the efficacy of the resulting methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations. In an attempt to better understand the underlying theory, its convergence is established in a more general setting that allows for time-varying parameters. Finally, an adaptive alternating minimization algorithm is presented by exploring the dual setting. This algorithm not only incorporates additional adaptivity, but also expands its applicability beyond standard strongly convex settings.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Discounted Stochastic Games under Prospect Theory with Applications to the Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the discounted criterion of nonzero-sum decentralized stochastic games with prospect players. The state and action spaces are finite. The state transition probability is nonstationary. Each player independently controls their own Markov chain. The subjective behavior of players is described by the prospect theory (PT). Compared to the average criterion of stochastic games under PT studied firstly in 2018, we are concerned with the time value of utility, i.e., the utility should be discounted in the future. Since PT distorts the probability, the optimality equation that plays a significant role in proving the existence of equilibrium does not exist. On the other hand, the games change into Markov decision processes (MDPs) with nonstationary payoff function when fixing others' stationary Markov strategies, then the occupation measure and the linear programming of stationary MDPs are no longer suitable. Therefore, we explore a new technique by constructing the marginal distribution on the state-action pairs at any time, and establish the existence of Nash equilibrium. When the initial state is given, there exists a Markov Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, this novel technique can be extended to the finite horizon criterion. Then, we present an algorithm to find a Markov $\varepsilon$-equilibrium. Finally, the model is applied to a noncooperative stochastic game among prosumers who can produce and consume energy in the smart grid, and we give some simulation results.</description>

      <title>Polynomial time algorithm for optimal stopping with fixed accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02227</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.02227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of high-dimensional path-dependent optimal stopping (OS) is important to multiple academic communities and applications. Modern OS tasks often have a large number of decision epochs, and complicated non-Markovian dynamics, making them especially challenging. Standard approaches, often relying on ADP, duality, deep learning and other heuristics, have shown strong empirical performance, yet have limited rigorous guarantees (which may scale exponentially in the problem parameters and/or require previous knowledge of basis functions or additional continuity assumptions). Although past work has placed these problems in the framework of computational complexity and polynomial-time approximability, those analyses were limited to simple one-dimensional problems. For long-horizon complex OS problems, is a polynomial time solution even theoretically possible? We prove that given access to an efficient simulator of the underlying information process, and fixed accuracy epsilon, there exists an algorithm that returns an epsilon-optimal solution (both stopping policies and approximate optimal values) with computational complexity scaling polynomially in the time horizon and underlying dimension. Like the first polynomial-time (approximation) algorithms for several other well-studied problems, our theoretical guarantees are polynomial yet impractical. Our approach is based on a novel expansion for the optimal value which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On Updating Static Output Feedback Controllers Under State-Space Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel update of a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller for a perturbed linear system. In almost every classical feedback controller design problem, a stabilizing feedback controller is designed given a stabilizable unstable system. In realistic scenarios, the system model is usually imperfect and subject to perturbations. A typical approach to attenuate the impacts of such perturbations on the system stability is repeating the whole controller design procedure to find an updated stabilizing SOF controller. Such an approach can be inefficient and occasionally infeasible. Using the notion of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP), we construct a simple norm minimization problem (a least-squares problem) to propose an efficient update of a nominal stabilizing SOF controller that can be applied to various control engineering applications in the case of perturbed scenarios like abrupt changes or inaccurate system models. In particular, considering norm-bounded known or unknown perturbations, this paper presents updated stabilizing SOF controllers and derives sufficient stability conditions. Geometric metrics to quantitatively measure the approach's robustness are defined. Moreover, we characterize the corresponding guaranteed stability regions, and specifically, for the case of norm-bounded unknown perturbations, we propose non-fragility-based robust updated stabilizing SOF controllers. Through extensive numerical simulations, we assess the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a state-feedback controller for a linear system, based only on noisy input-state data. We focus on input-state data corrupted by measurement errors, which, albeit less investigated, are as relevant as process disturbances in applications. For energy and instantaneous bounds on these measurement errors, we derive linear matrix inequalities for controller design where the one for the energy bound is equivalent to robust stabilization of all systems consistent with the noisy data points via a common Lyapunov function.</description>
