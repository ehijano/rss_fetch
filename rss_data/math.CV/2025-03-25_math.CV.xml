      <title>Weakly holomorphic homogeneous regular manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of complex manifolds which we call weakly holomorphic homogeneous regular manifolds (wHHR) manifolds. As the name suggests, this class contains the so-called holomorphic homogeneous regular manifolds but also other classes of complex manifolds such as two dimensional finite type domains and simply connected K\"ahler manifolds with pinched negative sectional curvature. For wHHR Stein manifolds we prove that the Bergman and Kobayashi metrics are biLipschitz equivalent.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a some natural class of weights $\K$ and any weighted space $$L^2(w) = \left\{ f : (-\pi,\pi) \to \CC \colon\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} {{|f(t)|^2} \over {w(t)}} dt &lt; \infty \right\},$$ where $w \in \K$, there exists a complete and minimal system $\{e^{i\lambda_nt}\}_{n\in \Z}$ of exponentials, which does not admit spectral synthesis.</description>

      <title>On uniformly lightness of one class of mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider mappings satisfying a certain estimate of the distortion of the modulus of families of paths, similar to the geometric definition of quasiconformal mappings. Under appropriate restrictions, we show that the class of such mappings is uniformly light, i.e., the chordal diameter of the image of continua whose diameter is bounded below is also bounded below uniformly over the class. Under some even greater restrictions, we establish some more explicit estimates of the distortion of the diameters of these continua.</description>

      <title>On the area of polynomial lemniscates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\"os posed in 1940 the extremal problem of studying the minimal area of the lemniscate $\{|p(z)|&lt;1\}$ of a monic polynomial $p$ of degree $n$ all of whose zeros are in the closed unit disc. In this article, we prove that there exist positive constants $c,C$ independent of the degree $n$ such that \[ \dfrac{c}{\log n} \leq \min \text{Area}( \{ |p(z)|&lt;1 \} ) \leq \frac{C}{\log \log n},\] improving substantially the previously best known lower bound (due to Pommerenke in 1961) as well as improving the best known upper bound (due to Wagner in 1988). We also study the inradius (radius of the largest inscribed disc); we provide an estimate for the inradius in terms of the area that confirms a 2009 conjecture of Solynin and Williams, and we use this to give a lower bound of order $(n \sqrt{\log n})^{-1}$ on the inradius, addressing a 1958 problem posed by Erd\"os, Herzog, and Piranian (confirming their conjecture up to the logarithmic factor). In addition to studying the area of $\{|p(z)|&lt;1\}$, we consider other sublevel sets $\{|p(z)|&lt;t\}$, proving both upper and lower bounds of the same order $1/\log \log n$ when $t&gt;1$ and proving power law upper and lower bounds when $0&lt;t&lt;1$. We also consider the minimal area problem under a more general constraint, namely, replacing the unit disc with a compact set $K$ of unit capacity, where we show that the minimal area converges to zero as $n \rightarrow \infty$ (giving an affirmative answer to another question of Erd\"os, Herzog, Piranian); we also investigate the structure of the area minimizing polynomials, showing that the normalized zero-counting measure converges to the equilibrium measure of $K$ as the degree $n \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Stability for complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations with an application to singular Ricci-flat metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first establish the weak stability results for solutions of complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations in relative full mass classes, extending the results known to hold in the full mass class. Building on weak stability, we then prove the $\mathcal{C}^{k,\alpha}$ stability of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on quasi-projective varieties. As an application, we study the limit of the singular Ricci-flat metrics on $\mathbb{Q}$-Calabi-Yau projective varieties, inspired by Tosatti's work on Calabi-Yau projective manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with eigenvalues and eigenvectors of bicomplex linear operators defined on bicomplex space. We investigate the properties of these operators in the context of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, along with some relevant theorems. Several theorems are explored to establish conditions for bicomplex eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Additionally, we examine the structure of the eigenspaces corresponding to these eigenvalues,analyze their properties, and discuss relevant theorems.</description>

      <title>Valuative compactifications of analytic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbf{C}$. We define a canonical compactification $X^{\!\urcorner}$ of the complex analytic space $X(\mathbf{C})$ by adding a Berkovich space over a trivially valued field at the boundary. The construction is functorial with respect to proper morphisms and preserves many properties, such as normality, regularity, etc. We prove a partial GAGA theorem in this setting : there is an equivalence between the categories of coherent sheaves on $X$ and $X^{\!\urcorner}$, and it induces bijections on global sections. The results still hold if $\mathbf{C}$ is replaced by a complete non-trivially valued field $k$, and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich analytic spaces over $k$.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Einstein Bergman metrics on pseudoconvex domains of dimension two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a two dimensional pseudoconvex domain of finite type with a K\"ahler-Einstein Bergman metric is biholomorphic to the unit ball. This answers an old question of Yau for such domains. The proof relies on asymptotics of derivatives of the Bergman kernel along critically tangent paths approaching the boundary, where the order of tangency equals the type of the boundary point being approached.</description>

Abstract: We prove several Sobolev-type inequalities related to the $\bar\partial$-operator on bounded domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$, which can be viewed as a $\bar\partial$-version of the classical Sobolev inequality and its various generalizations, and apply them to derive a generalization of the Sobolev Inequality with Trace in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As applications to complex analysis, we get an integral form of Maximum Modulus Principle for holomorphic functions, and an improvement of H\"ormander's $L^2$-estimate for $\bar\partial$ on bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains.</description>

      <title>Constrained maximization of conformal capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constellations of disks which are unions of disjoint hyperbolic disks in the unit disk with fixed radii and unfixed centers. We study the problem of maximizing the conformal capacity of a constellation with a fixed number of disks under constraints on the centers in two cases. In the first case the constraint is that the centers are at most at distance $R \in(0,1)$ from the origin and in the second case it is required that the centers are on the subsegment $[-R,R]$ of a diameter of the unit disk. We study also similar types of constellations with hyperbolic segments instead of the hyperbolic disks. Our computational experiments suggest that a dispersion phenomenon occurs: the disks/segments go as close to the unit circle as possible under these constraints and stay as far as possible from each other. The computation of capacity reduces to the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation which we solve using two methods: a fast boundary integral equation method and a high-order finite element method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue for more widespread use of manifold-like polyfolds (M-polyfolds) as differential geometric objects. M-polyfolds possess a distinct advantage over differentiable manifolds, enabling a smooth and local change of dimension. To establish their utility, we introduce tensors and prove the existence of Riemannian metrics, symplectic structures, and almost complex structures within the M-polyfold framework. Drawing inspiration from a series of highly acclaimed articles by L\'{a}szl\'{o} Lempert, we lay the foundation for advancing geometry and function theory in complex M-polyfolds.</description>

      <title>The P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem with semiclassical external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical P\'olya-Tchebotarev problem, commonly stated as a max-min logarithmic energy problem, asks for finding a compact of minimal capacity in the complex plane which connects a prescribed collection of fixed points. Variants of this problem have found ramifications and applications in the theory of non-hermitian orthogonal polynomials, random matrices, approximation theory, among others. Here we consider an extension of this classical problem, including a semiclassical external field, and enforcing finitely many prescribed collections of points to be connected, possibly also to infinity. Our method is based on Rakhmanov's approach to max-min problems in logarithmic potential theory, utilizes the developed machinery by Mart\'inez-Finkelshtein and Rakhmanov on critical measures, and extends the development of Kuijlaars and the second named author from the context of polynomial external fields to the semiclassical case considered here.</description>

      <title>Partition functions of determinantal point processes on polarized K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic expansion of the partition functions of determinantal point processes defined on a polarized K\"ahler manifold. The full asymptotic expansion of the partition functions is derived in two ways: one using Bergman kernel asymptotics and the other using the Quillen anomaly formula along with the asymptotic expansion of the Ray-Singer analytic torsion. By combining these two expressions, we show that each coefficient is given by geometric functionals on K\"ahler metrics satisfying the cocycle identity, and its first variation is closely related to the asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. In particular, these functionals naturally generalize the Mabuchi functional in K\"ahler geometry and the Liouville functional on Riemann surfaces. Furthermore, we show that a Futaki-type holomorphic invariant obstructs the existence of critical points for each geometric functional given by the coefficients of the asymptotic expansion. Finally, we verify some of our results through explicit computations, which hold without the polarization assumption.</description>
