      <title>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</description>

      <title>Non-Equivalence of Smooth and Nodal Conformal Block Functors in Logarithmic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA) admitting a non-lowest generated module in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$ (e.g., the triplet algebras $\mathcal{W}_p$ for $p\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$ or the even symplectic fermion VOAs $SF_d^+$ for $d\in \mathbb{Z}_+$). We prove that, unlike in the rational case, the spaces of conformal blocks associated to certain $\mathbb V$-modules do not form a vector bundle on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,N}$ for $N\geq 4$ by showing that their dimensions differ between nodal and smooth curves. Consequently, the sheaf of coinvariants associated to these $\mathbb V$-modules on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,N}$ is not locally free for $N\geq 4$. It also follows that, unlike in the rational case, the mode transition algebra $\mathfrak A$ introduced by Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen is not isomorphic to the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb X\in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb X)}\mathbb X\otimes \mathbb{X}'$ as an object of $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes 2})$.</description>

      <title>Quartic BV structures in supercategories and modified necklace Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modified version of the necklace Lie bialgebra associated to a quiver, in which the bracket and cobracket insert (rather than remove) pairs of arrows in involution. This structure is then related to canonical quartic Poisson/Batalin-Vilkovisky structures on suitable representation varieties of the quiver. Constructions on the representation side take place in symmetric monoidal $\Pi$-categories, which prompts a discussion of graded differential operators on commutative monoids in any such category. The generality of the categorical approach allows us to fully recover necklace structures, showing how the modified and classical necklace operations are related via dualisability.</description>

      <title>Invariants from involutory Hopf algebras of 3-manifolds with embedded framed links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give invariants of pairs $(M,L)$ consisting of a closed connected oriented three-manifold and an (oriented) framed link $L$ embedded in $M$. This invariant generalizes the Kuperberg and Hennings-Kauffman-Radford (HKR) invariants of three-manifolds. We define Heegaard-Link diagrams which represent the pair $(M,L)$ and use the data of an involutory Hopf algebra and a representation of the Drinfeld double to construct the invariant. We show that if $L$ is the empty link, then the invariant recovers the Kuperberg invariant, and if $M$ is the three-sphere and certain particular representation is chosen, then the invariant recovers the HKR invariant. We also show that if the representation is the left regular representation of the Drinfeld double, then we recover the Kuperberg invariant of the surgery manifold $M(L)$, contributing to a new proof of the relationship between the HKR and Kuperberg invariants in the semisimple setting. To this end, we give a Heegaard diagram for $M(L)$ coming from the Heegaard-Link diagram representing the pair $(M,L)$. We also introduce a colored link invariant extending the construction and show it recovers the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev colored link invariant.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Integrability: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989, Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both physics and mathematics.</description>

      <title>Remark on twists of Frobenius algebra and link homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss twists on Frobenius algebras in the context of link homology. In his paper in 2006, Khovanov asserted that a twist of a Frobenius algebra yields an isomorphic chain complex on each link diagram. Although the result has been widely accepted for nearly two decades, a subtle gap in the original proof was found in the induction step of the construction of the isomorphism. Following discussion with Khovanov, we decided to provide a new proof. Our proof is based on a detailed analysis of configurations of circles in each state.</description>

      <title>Cluster Algebras and Dilogarithm Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a reasonably self-contained exposition of the fascinating interplay between cluster algebras and the dilogarithm in the past two decades. The dilogarithm has a long and rich history since it was studied by Euler. The most intriguing property of the function is that it satisfies various functional relations, which we call dilogarithm identities (DIs). In the 1990s, various DIs were conjectured in the study of integrable models, but most of them were left unsolved. On the other hand, cluster algebras are a class of commutative algebras introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky around 2000. In this text, we explain how the above DIs are proved using the techniques and results of cluster algebras. Also, we employ the DI associated with each period in a cluster pattern of cluster algebra as the leitmotif and present several proofs, variations, and generalizations of them with various methods and techniques. The quantum DIs are also treated from a unified point of view compared to the classical ones.</description>
