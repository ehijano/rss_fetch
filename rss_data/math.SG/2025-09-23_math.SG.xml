      <title>Smooth perfectness of Hamiltonian diffeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental result of Banyaga states that the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group of a closed symplectic manifold is perfect. We refine this result by proving that, locally in the $C^\infty$ topology, the number of commutators needed to express a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is bounded, and the commutators can be chosen to depend smoothly on the diffeomorphism. As a corollary, we show that any homogeneous quasimorphism on the Hamiltonian diffeomorphism group is continuous in the $C^\infty$ topology. We establish an analogous smooth perfectness result for compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of open symplectic manifolds, where Banyaga proved that the kernel of the Calabi homomorphism is perfect. For symplectic manifolds with boundary, we define a natural group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms that need not restrict to the identity on the boundary. We extend the Calabi homomorphism to this setting and prove a corresponding refined perfectness result. These results are motivated by our work on symplectic packing stability for symplectic manifolds with boundary, where they play a key role in our symplectic embedding constructions.</description>

      <title>Stratification of the half-density quantization of the Jeffrey-Weitsman-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we review the quantization procedure employed by Jeffrey and Weitsman in their formalization of Witten's three manifold invariants. In so doing, we formalize the stratification of the Lagrangian leaf which corresponds to the flat connections of a bounding surface which extend into the handlebody. The smooth structure of this space motivates a procedure for a stratified quantization: use volumes and corresponding half-densities on the stratified tangent bundle. The pairing is then defined such that the proposed BKS pairing still yields the torsion in the integrand of the Jeffrey-Weitsman-Witten invariant. The stratification yields a natural covariant constant half-density which results in a reduction of the structure group for reducible connections. The conditions of their integral are refined in the context of the stratification and this change reproduces the invariant exactly for a plethora of 3-manifolds and extends the invariant for some.</description>

      <title>Removal of singularities in Morse-Bott symplectizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder and Bourgeois proved that a finite energy punctured pseudoholomorphic curve in the symplectization of a Morse-Bott contact manifold either has a removable singularity or asymptotes to a Reeb orbit. We give an alternate proof of this result.</description>

      <title>Legendrian non-squeezing via microsheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Legendrian pre-quantization lifts of many non-exact Lagrangian submanifolds in $\mathbb{C}^n$ retain some quantitative rigidity from the symplectic base. In particular, they cannot be moved by Legendrian isotopy into an arbitrarily small pre-quantized cylinder. This is a high dimensional generalization of results of Dimitroglou Rizell--Sullivan in dimension 3. In this setting, we give a new proof of non-squeezing using normal rulings, and in high dimension, we obtain our results using a category of (micro)sheaves associated to a Legendrian submanifold of pre-quantizations.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints on clean Lagrangian intersections from $\mathbb{Q}$-valued augmentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be the connected sum in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of an arbitrary knot and the $(2,q)$-torus knot for $q\neq \pm 1$, and consider its conormal bundle $L_K$ in $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$. We prove that there is no compactly supported Hamiltonian diffeomorphism $\varphi$ on $T^*\mathbb{R}^3$ such that $\varphi(L_K)$ and the zero section $\mathbb{R}^3$ intersect cleanly along the unknot in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For the proof, we examine the knot DGA, whose homology was proved to be isomorphic to the knot contact homology by Ekholm, Etnyre, Ng and Sullivan, with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}[\lambda^{\pm},\mu^{\pm},U^{\pm}]$. We find an algebraic constraint imposed on every $\mathbb{Q}$-valued augmentation of the knot DGA of $K$ when $q\geq 3$. This constraint involves rational roots of polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[T]$, and we apply Hilbert's irreducibility theorem to complete the proof. Using a similar idea, we also prove an analogous result replacing the $(2,q)$-torus knot with the figure-eight knot.</description>

      <title>Pensive billiards, point vortices, and the silver ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

      <title>Circle bundles with PSC over large manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01047v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct infinitely many examples of macroscopically large manifolds of dimension $m \geq 4$ equipped with circle bundles whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature and have macroscopic dimension at most $\lceil m/2 \rceil + 1$. In particular, we answer a question of Gromov on the existence of circle bundles over enlargeable manifolds whose total spaces admit metrics of positive scalar curvature, in all dimensions. Our constructions are based on techniques from symplectic geometry.</description>
