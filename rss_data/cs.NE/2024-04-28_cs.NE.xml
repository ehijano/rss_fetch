      <title>Evolve Cost-aware Acquisition Functions Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world optimization scenarios involve expensive evaluation with unknown and heterogeneous costs. Cost-aware Bayesian optimization stands out as a prominent solution in addressing these challenges. To approach the global optimum within a limited budget in a cost-efficient manner, the design of cost-aware acquisition functions (AFs) becomes a crucial step. However, traditional manual design paradigm typically requires extensive domain knowledge and involves a labor-intensive trial-and-error process. This paper introduces EvolCAF, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary computation (EC) to automatically design cost-aware AFs. Leveraging the crossover and mutation in the algorithm space, EvolCAF offers a novel design paradigm, significantly reduces the reliance on domain expertise and model training. The designed cost-aware AF maximizes the utilization of available information from historical data, surrogate models and budget details. It introduces novel ideas not previously explored in the existing literature on acquisition function design, allowing for clear interpretations to provide insights into its behavior and decision-making process. In comparison to the well-known EIpu and EI-cool methods designed by human experts, our approach showcases remarkable efficiency and generalization across various tasks, including 12 synthetic problems and 3 real-world hyperparameter tuning test sets.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Stepwise Control of Firing and Learning Thresholds in a Spiking Randomly Connected Neural Network toward Hardware Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose hardware-oriented models of intrinsic plasticity (IP) and synaptic plasticity (SP) for spiking randomly connected recursive neural network (RNN). Although the potential of RNNs for temporal data processing has been demonstrated, randomness of the network architecture often causes performance degradation. Self-organization mechanism using IP and SP can mitigate the degradation, therefore, we compile these functions in a spiking neuronal model. To implement the function of IP, a variable firing threshold is introduced to each excitatory neuron in the RNN that changes stepwise in accordance with its activity. We also define other thresholds for SP that synchronize with the firing threshold, which determine the direction of stepwise synaptic update that is executed on receiving a pre-synaptic spike. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model through simulations of temporal data learning and anomaly detection with a spiking RNN using publicly available electrocardiograms. Considering hardware implementation, we employ discretized thresholds and synaptic weights and show that these parameters can be reduced to binary if the RNN architecture is appropriately designed. This contributes to minimization of the circuit of the neuronal system having IP and SP.</description>

      <title>The Inefficiency of Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the search behaviour of genetic programming for symbolic regression in practically relevant but limited settings, allowing exhaustive enumeration of all solutions. This enables us to quantify the success probability of finding the best possible expressions, and to compare the search efficiency of genetic programming to random search in the space of semantically unique expressions. This analysis is made possible by improved algorithms for equality saturation, which we use to improve the Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm; this produces the set of semantically unique expression structures, orders of magnitude smaller than the full symbolic regression search space. We compare the efficiency of random search in the set of unique expressions and genetic programming. For our experiments we use two real-world datasets where symbolic regression has been used to produce well-fitting univariate expressions: the Nikuradse dataset of flow in rough pipes and the Radial Acceleration Relation of galaxy dynamics. The results show that genetic programming in such limited settings explores only a small fraction of all unique expressions, and evaluates expressions repeatedly that are congruent to already visited expressions.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive into Effects of Structural Bias on CMA-ES Performance along Affine Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To guide the design of better iterative optimisation heuristics, it is imperative to understand how inherent structural biases within algorithm components affect the performance on a wide variety of search landscapes. This study explores the impact of structural bias in the modular Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (modCMA), focusing on the roles of various modulars within the algorithm. Through an extensive investigation involving 435,456 configurations of modCMA, we identified key modules that significantly influence structural bias of various classes. Our analysis utilized the Deep-BIAS toolbox for structural bias detection and classification, complemented by SHAP analysis for quantifying module contributions. The performance of these configurations was tested on a sequence of affine-recombined functions, maintaining fixed optimum locations while gradually varying the landscape features. Our results demonstrate an interplay between module-induced structural bias and algorithm performance across different landscape characteristics.</description>

      <title>Converting High-Performance and Low-Latency SNNs through Explicit Modelling of Residual Error in ANNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered interest due to their energy efficiency and superior effectiveness on neuromorphic chips compared with traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). One of the mainstream approaches to implementing deep SNNs is the ANN-SNN conversion, which integrates the efficient training strategy of ANNs with the energy-saving potential and fast inference capability of SNNs. However, under extreme low-latency conditions, the existing conversion theory suggests that the problem of misrepresentation of residual membrane potentials in SNNs, i.e., the inability of IF neurons with a reset-by-subtraction mechanism to respond to residual membrane potentials beyond the range from resting potential to threshold, leads to a performance gap in the converted SNNs compared to the original ANNs. This severely limits the possibility of practical application of SNNs on delay-sensitive edge devices. Existing conversion methods addressing this problem usually involve modifying the state of the conversion spiking neurons. However, these methods do not consider their adaptability and compatibility with neuromorphic chips. We propose a new approach based on explicit modeling of residual errors as additive noise. The noise is incorporated into the activation function of the source ANN, which effectively reduces the residual error. Our experiments on the CIFAR10/100 dataset verify that our approach exceeds the prevailing ANN-SNN conversion methods and directly trained SNNs concerning accuracy and the required time steps. Overall, our method provides new ideas for improving SNN performance under ultra-low-latency conditions and is expected to promote practical neuromorphic hardware applications for further development.</description>

      <title>Closing the gap: Optimizing Guidance and Control Networks through Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We improve the accuracy of Guidance &amp; Control Networks (G&amp;CNETs), trained to represent the optimal control policies of a time-optimal transfer and a mass-optimal landing, respectively. In both cases we leverage the dynamics of the spacecraft, described by Ordinary Differential Equations which incorporate a neural network on their right-hand side (Neural ODEs). Since the neural dynamics is differentiable, the ODEs sensitivities to the network parameters can be computed using the variational equations, thereby allowing to update the G&amp;CNET parameters based on the observed dynamics. We start with a straightforward regression task, training the G&amp;CNETs on datasets of optimal trajectories using behavioural cloning. These networks are then refined using the Neural ODE sensitivities by minimizing the error between the final states and the target states. We demonstrate that for the orbital transfer, the final error to the target can be reduced by 99% on a single trajectory and by 70% on a batch of 500 trajectories. For the landing problem the reduction in error is around 98-99% (position) and 40-44% (velocity). This step significantly enhances the accuracy of G&amp;CNETs, which instills greater confidence in their reliability for operational use. We also compare our results to the popular Dataset Aggregation method (DaGGER) and allude to the strengths and weaknesses of both methods.</description>

      <title>Transductive Spiking Graph Neural Networks for Loihi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a specialized branch of deep learning, designed to address problems where pairwise relations between objects are crucial. Recent advancements utilize graph convolutional neural networks to extract features within graph structures. Despite promising results, these methods face challenges in real-world applications due to sparse features, resulting in inefficient resource utilization. Recent studies draw inspiration from the mammalian brain and employ spiking neural networks to model and learn graph structures. However, these approaches are limited to traditional Von Neumann-based computing systems, which still face hardware inefficiencies. In this study, we present a fully neuromorphic implementation of spiking graph neural networks designed for Loihi 2. We optimize network parameters using Lava Bayesian Optimization, a novel hyperparameter optimization system compatible with neuromorphic computing architectures. We showcase the performance benefits of combining neuromorphic Bayesian optimization with our approach for citation graph classification using fixed-precision spiking neurons. Our results demonstrate the capability of integer-precision, Loihi 2 compatible spiking neural networks in performing citation graph classification with comparable accuracy to existing floating point implementations.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Potential of Fractional Calculus in Graph Neural Networks with FROND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the FRactional-Order graph Neural Dynamical network (FROND), a new continuous graph neural network (GNN) framework. Unlike traditional continuous GNNs that rely on integer-order differential equations, FROND employs the Caputo fractional derivative to leverage the non-local properties of fractional calculus. This approach enables the capture of long-term dependencies in feature updates, moving beyond the Markovian update mechanisms in conventional integer-order models and offering enhanced capabilities in graph representation learning. We offer an interpretation of the node feature updating process in FROND from a non-Markovian random walk perspective when the feature updating is particularly governed by a diffusion process. We demonstrate analytically that oversmoothing can be mitigated in this setting. Experimentally, we validate the FROND framework by comparing the fractional adaptations of various established integer-order continuous GNNs, demonstrating their consistently improved performance and underscoring the framework's potential as an effective extension to enhance traditional continuous GNNs. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/zknus/ICLR2024-FROND}.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Spiking Multi-Layer Perceptrons with Multiplication-Free Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in adapting deep convolution architectures for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have significantly enhanced image classification performance and reduced computational burdens. However, the inability of Multiplication-Free Inference (MFI) to align with attention and transformer mechanisms, which are critical to superior performance on high-resolution vision tasks, imposing limitations on these gains. To address this, our research explores a new pathway, drawing inspiration from the progress made in Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). We propose an innovative spiking MLP architecture that uses batch normalization to retain MFI compatibility and introducing a spiking patch encoding layer to enhance local feature extraction capabilities. As a result, we establish an efficient multi-stage spiking MLP network that blends effectively global receptive fields with local feature extraction for comprehensive spike-based computation. Without relying on pre-training or sophisticated SNN training techniques, our network secures a top-1 accuracy of 66.39% on the ImageNet-1K dataset, surpassing the directly trained spiking ResNet-34 by 2.67%. Furthermore, we curtail computational costs, model parameters, and simulation steps. An expanded version of our network compares with the performance of the spiking VGG-16 network with a 71.64% top-1 accuracy, all while operating with a model capacity 2.1 times smaller. Our findings highlight the potential of our deep SNN architecture in effectively integrating global and local learning abilities. Interestingly, the trained receptive field in our network mirrors the activity patterns of cortical cells.

      <title>Large Language Models as Evolutionary Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have achieved remarkable success in tackling complex combinatorial optimization problems. However, EAs often demand carefully-designed operators with the aid of domain expertise to achieve satisfactory performance. In this work, we present the first study on large language models (LLMs) as evolutionary combinatorial optimizers. The main advantage is that it requires minimal domain knowledge and human efforts, as well as no additional training of the model. This approach is referred to as LLM-driven EA (LMEA). Specifically, in each generation of the evolutionary search, LMEA instructs the LLM to select parent solutions from current population, and perform crossover and mutation to generate offspring solutions. Then, LMEA evaluates these new solutions and include them into the population for the next generation. LMEA is equipped with a self-adaptation mechanism that controls the temperature of the LLM. This enables it to balance between exploration and exploitation and prevents the search from getting stuck in local optima. We investigate the power of LMEA on the classical traveling salesman problems (TSPs) widely used in combinatorial optimization research. Notably, the results show that LMEA performs competitively to traditional heuristics in finding high-quality solutions on TSP instances with up to 20 nodes. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of LLM-driven crossover/mutation and the self-adaptation mechanism in evolutionary search. In summary, our results reveal the great potentials of LLMs as evolutionary optimizers for solving combinatorial problems. We hope our research shall inspire future explorations on LLM-driven EAs for complex optimization challenges.</description>
