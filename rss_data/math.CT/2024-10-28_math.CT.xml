      <title>Synthetic 1-Categories in Directed Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of directed type theory seeks to design type theories capable of reasoning synthetically about (higher) categories, by generalizing the symmetric identity types of Martin-L\"of Type Theory to asymmetric hom-types. We articulate the directed type theory of the category model, with appropriate modalities for keeping track of variances and a powerful directed-J rule capable of proving results about arbitrary terms of hom-types; we put this rule to use in making several constructions in synthetic 1-category theory. Because this theory is expressed entirely in terms of generalized algebraic theories, we know automatically that this directed type theory admits a syntax model and is the first step towards directed higher observational type theory.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Model structures for diagrammatic $(\infty, n)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagrammatic sets admit a notion of internal equivalence in the sense of coinductive weak invertibility, with similar properties to its analogue in strict $\omega$-categories. We construct a model structure whose fibrant objects are diagrammatic sets in which every round pasting diagram is equivalent to a single cell -- its weak composite -- and propose them as a model of $(\infty, \infty)$-categories. For each $n &lt; \infty$, we then construct a model structure whose fibrant objects are those $(\infty, \infty)$-categories whose cells in dimension $&gt; n$ are all weakly invertible. We show that weak equivalences between fibrant objects are precisely morphisms that are essentially surjective on cells of all dimensions. On the way to this result, we also construct model structures for $(\infty, n)$-categories on marked diagrammatic sets, which split into a coinductive and an inductive case when $n = \infty$, and prove that they are Quillen equivalent to the unmarked model structures when $n &lt; \infty$ and in the coinductive case of $n = \infty$. Finally, we prove that the $(\infty, 0)$-model structure is Quillen equivalent to the classical model structure on simplicial sets. This establishes the first proof of the homotopy hypothesis for a model of $\infty$-groupoids defined as $(\infty, \infty)$-categories whose cells in dimension $&gt; 0$ are all weakly invertible.</description>

Abstract: It is a classical result that the category of finitely-generated free monoids serves as a PROP for commutative bialgebras. Attaching permutations to fix the order of multiplication, we construct an extension of this category that is equivalent to the PROP for bialgebras.</description>

      <title>Frobenius monoidal functors from ambiadjunctions and their lifts to Drinfeld centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify general conditions, formulated using the projection formula morphisms, for a functor that is simultaneously left and right adjoint to a strong monoidal functor to be a Frobenius monoidal functor. Moreover, we identify stronger conditions for the adjoint functor to extend to a braided Frobenius monoidal functor on Drinfeld centers building on our previous work in [arXiv:2402.10094]. As an application, we construct concrete examples of (braided) Frobenius monoidal functors obtained from morphisms of Hopf algebras via induction.</description>

      <title>Flat quasi-coherent sheaves as directed colimits, and quasi-coherent cotorsion periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every flat quasi-coherent sheaf on a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme is a directed colimit of locally countably presentable flat quasi-coherent sheaves. More generally, the same assertion holds for any countably quasi-compact, countably quasi-separated scheme. Moreover, for three categories of complexes of flat quasi-coherent sheaves, we show that all complexes in the category can be obtained as directed colimits of complexes of locally countably presentable flat quasi-coherent sheaves from the same category. In particular, on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme, every flat quasi-coherent sheaf is a directed colimit of flat quasi-coherent sheaves of finite projective dimension. In the second part of the paper, we discuss cotorsion periodicity in category-theoretic context, generalizing an argument of Bazzoni, Cortes-Izurdiaga, and Estrada. As the main application, we deduce the assertion that any cotorsion-periodic quasi-coherent sheaf on a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme is cotorsion.</description>

      <title>Counting in Calabi--Yau categories, with applications to Hall algebras and knot polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that homotopy cardinality -- a priori ill-defined for many dg-categories, including all periodic ones -- has a reasonable definition for even-dimensional Calabi--Yau (evenCY) categories and their relative generalizations (under appropriate finiteness conditions).
  As a first application we solve the problem of defining an intrinsic Hall algebra for degreewise finite pre-triangulated dg-categories in the case of oddCY categories. We compare this definition with To\"en's derived Hall algebras (in case they are well-defined) and with other approaches based on extended Hall algebras and central reduction, including a construction of Hall algebras associated with Calabi--Yau triples of triangulated categories. For a category equivalent to the root category of a 1CY abelian category $\mathcal A$, the algebra is shown to be isomorphic to the Drinfeld double of the twisted Ringel--Hall algebra of $\mathcal A$, thus resolving in the Calabi--Yau case the long-standing problem of realizing the latter as a Hall algebra intrinsically defined for such a triangulated category.
  Our second application is the proof of a conjecture of Ng--Rutherford--Shende--Sivek, which provides an intrinsic formula for the ruling polynomial of a Legendrian knot $L$, and its generalization to Legendrian tangles, in terms of the augmentation category of $L$.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality and Calabi-Yau structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Koszul duality between differential graded categories and pointed curved coalgebras interchanges smooth and proper Calabi-Yau structures. This result is a generalization and conceptual explanation of the following two applications. For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the universal enveloping algebra is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain coalgebra, which exists if and only if Poincare duality is satisfied. For a topological space X having the homotopy type of a finite complex we show an oriented Poincare duality structure (with local coefficients) on X is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the dg coalgebra of chains on X and to a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the dg algebra of chains on the based loop space of X.</description>
