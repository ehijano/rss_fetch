      <title>Free-breathing 3D cardiac extracellular volume (ECV) mapping using a linear tangent space alignment (LTSA) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To develop a new method for free-breathing 3D extracellular volume (ECV) mapping of the whole heart at 3T. $\textbf{Methods:}$ A free-breathing 3D cardiac ECV mapping method was developed at 3T. T1 mapping was performed before and after contrast agent injection using a free-breathing ECG-gated inversion-recovery sequence with spoiled gradient echo readout. A linear tangent space alignment (LTSA) model-based method was used to reconstruct high-frame-rate dynamic images from (k,t)-space data sparsely sampled along a random stack-of-stars trajectory. Joint T1 and transmit B1 estimation was performed voxel-by-voxel for pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping. To account for the time-varying T1 after contrast agent injection, a linearly time-varying T1 model was introduced for post-contrast T1 mapping. ECV maps were generated by aligning pre- and post-contrast T1 maps through affine transformation. $\textbf{Results:}$ The feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated using in vivo studies with six healthy volunteers at 3T. We obtained 3D ECV maps at a spatial resolution of 1.9$\times$1.9$\times$4.5 $mm^{3}$ and a FOV of 308$\times$308$\times$144 $mm^{3}$, with a scan time of 10.1$\pm$1.4 and 10.6$\pm$1.6 min before and after contrast agent injection, respectively. The ECV maps and the pre- and post-contrast T1 maps obtained by the proposed method were in good agreement with the 2D MOLLI method both qualitatively and quantitatively. $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ The proposed method allows for free-breathing 3D ECV mapping of the whole heart within a practically feasible imaging time. The estimated ECV values from the proposed method were comparable to those from the existing method. $\textbf{Keywords:}$ cardiac extracellular volume (ECV) mapping, cardiac T1 mapping, linear tangent space alignment (LTSA), manifold learning</description>

      <title>Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (SR$^2$-CSD) of Diffusion MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) is crucial for estimating white matter fiber orientations using diffusion MRI data. A relevant parameter in CSD is the maximum order $l_{max}$ used in the spherical harmonics series, influencing the angular resolution of the Fiber Orientation Distributions (FODs). Lower $l_{max}$ values produce smoother and more stable estimates, but result in reduced angular resolution. Conversely, higher $l_{max}$ values, as employed in the Super-Resolved CSD variant, are essential for resolving narrow inter-fiber angles but lead to spurious lobes due to increased noise sensitivity. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved CSD (SR$^2$-CSD) approach, incorporating spatial priors into the CSD framework. This method leverages spatial information among adjacent voxels, enhancing the stability and noise robustness of FOD estimations. SR$^2$-CSD facilitates the practical use of Super-Resolved CSD by including a J-invariant auto-calibrated total variation FOD denoiser. We evaluated the performance of SR$^2$-CSD against standard CSD and Super-Resolved CSD using phantom numerical data and various real brain datasets, including a test-retest sample of six subjects scanned twice. In phantom data, SR$^2$-CSD outperformed both CSD and Super-Resolved CSD, reducing the angular error (AE) by approximately half and the peak number error (PNE) by a factor of three across all noise levels considered. In real data, SR$^2$-CSD produced more continuous FOD estimates with higher spatial-angular coherency. In the test-retest sample, SR$^2$-CSD consistently yielded more reproducible estimates, with reduced AE, PNE, mean squared error, and increased angular correlation coefficient between the FODs estimated from the two scans for each subject.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Generative Models in Medical Imaging: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired Generative Models (GMs), in particular Diffusion Models (DMs) and Poisson Flow Models (PFMs), enhance Bayesian methods and promise great utility in medical imaging. This review examines the transformative role of such generative methods. First, a variety of physics-inspired GMs, including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Score-based Diffusion Models (SDMs), and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGMs and PFGM++), are revisited, with an emphasis on their accuracy, robustness as well as acceleration. Then, major applications of physics-inspired GMs in medical imaging are presented, comprising image reconstruction, image generation, and image analysis. Finally, future research directions are brainstormed, including unification of physics-inspired GMs, integration with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and potential novel applications of GMs. Since the development of generative methods has been rapid, this review will hopefully give peers and learners a timely snapshot of this new family of physics-driven generative models and help capitalize their enormous potential for medical imaging.</description>
