      <title>Marginal Fermi liquid behavior at the onset of $\boldsymbol{2k_F}$ density wave order in two-dimensional metals with flat hot spots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze quantum fluctuation effects at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge- or spin-density wave order in two-dimensional metals, for a model where the ordering wave vector $\boldsymbol{Q}$ connects a single pair of hot spots on the Fermi surface with a vanishing Fermi surface curvature. The tangential momentum dependence of the bare dispersion near the hot spots is proportional to $|k_t|^\alpha$ with $\alpha &gt; 2$. We first compute the order parameter susceptibility and the fermion self-energy in random phase approximation (RPA). Logarithmic divergences are subsequently treated by a renormalization group analysis. The coupling between the order parameter fluctuations and the fermions vanishes logarithmically in the low-energy limit. As a consequence, the logarithmic divergences found in RPA do not sum up to anomalous power laws. Instead, only logarithmic corrections to Fermi liquid behavior are obtained. In particular, the quasiparticle weight and the Fermi velocity vanish logarithmically at the hot spots.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlations at Oxide Interfaces: What is Hidden in a Plane View?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prime goal for this lecture is to provide a reader with a reasonably self-sufficient answer to the question of what interesting effects can happen if you join two dissimilar materials with correlated carriers to construct a sandwich with the interface across those layers. Through the lens of physical phenomena, we will delve into the design ideas that lead to the creation of new synthetic quantum materials with properties primarily governed by the interface.</description>

      <title>Crystalline axion electrodynamics in charge-ordered Dirac semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals can be driven into an insulating state by coupling to a charge density wave (CDW) order. Here, we consider the quantized crystalline responses of such charge-ordered Dirac semimetals, which we dub Dirac-CDW insulators, in which charge is bound to disclination defects of the lattice. Using analytic and numeric methods we show the following. First, when the CDW is lattice-commensurate, disclination-line defects of the lattice have a quantized charge per length. Second, when the CDW is inversion-symmetric, disclinations of the lattice have a quantized electric polarization. Third, when the CDW is lattice-commensurate and inversion-symmetric, disclinations are characterized by a "disclination filling anomaly" -- a quantized difference in the total charge bound to disclination-lines of Dirac-CDW with open and periodic boundaries. We construct an effective response theory that captures the topological responses of the Dirac-CDW insulators in terms of a total derivative term, denoted the $R\wedge F$ term. The $R\wedge F$ term describes the crystalline analog of the axion electrodynamics that are found in Weyl semimetal-CDW insulators. We also use the crystalline responses and corresponding response theories to classify the strongly correlated topological phases of three-dimensions Dirac-semimetals.</description>

      <title>Strong non-linear response of strange metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior and properties of strange metals remains an outstanding challenge in correlated electron systems. Recently, a model of a quantum critical metal with spatially random couplings to a critical boson (Patel et al., Science 381, 790 (2023)) has been shown to capture the linear-in-$T$ resistivity down to zero temperature ($T$) - one of the universal experimental signatures of strange metals. In our work we explore the non-linear transport properties of such a model of strange metal. Uniting the large-$N$ and Keldysh field theory formalisms, we derive a set of kinetic equations for the strange metal and use it to compute nonlinear conductivity. We find that the third-order conductivity is enhanced by a factor of ${T_F}/{T}$ in comparison to a Fermi liquid, resulting in a strong temperature dependence. This behavior is shown to arise from the strong, non-analytic energy dependence of scattering rate and self-energies for electrons. We highlight the role of energy relaxation and electron-boson drag for the nonlinear responses. Finally, we discuss the potential for nonanalytic nonlinear electric field ($\vec E$) response arising at low temperatures. Our work demonstrates the characteristic features of strange metals in nonlinear transport, that may allow to gain more insight about their behavior in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport properties of the topological Dirac Semimetal $\alpha$-Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the electrical resistivity ($\rho$) and thermoelectric power (S) in a thin film of strained single-crystalline $\alpha$-Sn grown by molecular beam epitaxy on an insulating substrate. The temperature (T) dependence of the resistivity of $\alpha$-Sn can be divided into two regions:below T* $\approx$ 135 K $\rho$(T) shows a metallic-like behaviour, while above this temperature an increasing contribution from thermally excited holes to electrical transport is observed. However, it is still dominated by highly mobile electrons, resulting in a negative sign of the Seebeck coefficient above T = 47 K. In the low temperature limit, a small positive S likely reflects the persistent contribution from low-mobility holes or the positive phonon-drag thermopower. In the presence of the magnetic field (B) applied along an electric field or thermal gradient, we note a negative magnetoresistance or a negative slope of S(B), respectively. The theoretical prediction for the former (calculated using density functional theory) agrees well with the experiment. However, these characteristics quickly disappear when the magnetic field is deviated from an orientation parallel to the electrical field or the thermal gradient. We indicate that the behaviour of the electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power can be explained in terms of the chiral current arising from the topologically non-trivial electronic structure of $\alpha$-Sn. Its decay at high temperature is a consequence of the decreasing ratio between the intervalley Weyl relaxation time to the Drude scattering time.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo based techniques for quantum magnets with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are relevant for a large variety of quantum systems in quantum optics and condensed matter physics. In particular, the control of quantum-optical platforms promises to gain deep insights in quantum-critical properties induced by the long-range nature of interactions. From a theoretical perspective, long-range interactions are notoriously complicated to treat. Here, we give an overview of recent advancements to investigate quantum magnets with long-range interactions focusing on two techniques based on Monte Carlo integration. First, the method of perturbative continuous unitary transformations where classical Monte Carlo integration is applied within the embedding scheme of white graphs. This linked-cluster expansion allows to extract high-order series expansions of energies and observables in the thermodynamic limit. Second, stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo which enables calculations on large finite systems. Finite-size scaling can then be used to determine physical properties of the infinite system. In recent years, both techniques have been applied successfully to one- and two-dimensional quantum magnets involving long-range Ising, XY, and Heisenberg interactions on various bipartite and non-bipartite lattices. Here, we summarise the obtained quantum-critical properties including critical exponents for all these systems in a coherent way. Further, we review how long-range interactions are used to study quantum phase transitions above the upper critical dimension and the scaling techniques to extract these quantum critical properties from the numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of spin excitations and charge order in bulk crystals of the infinite-layer nickelate LaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent x-ray spectroscopic studies have revealed spin excitations and charge density waves in thin films of infinite-layer (IL) nickelates. However, clarifying whether the origin of these phenomena is intrinsic to the material class or attributable to impurity phases in the films has presented a major challenge. Here we utilize topotactic methods to synthesize bulk crystals of the IL nickelate LaNiO$_2$ with crystallographically oriented surfaces. We examine these crystals using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ni $L_3$-edge to elucidate the spin and charge correlations in the bulk of the material. While we detect the presence of prominent spin excitations in the crystals, fingerprints of charge order are absent at the ordering vectors identified in previous in thin-film studies. These results contribute to the understanding of the bulk properties of LaNiO$_2$ and establish topotactically synthesized crystals as viable complementary specimens for spectroscopic investigations.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Controlled Bond Expansion for Density Matrix Renormalization Group Ground State Search at Single-Site Costs" (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 246402 (2023)], Gleis, Li, and von Delft present an algorithm for expanding the bond dimension of a Matrix Product State wave function, giving accuracy similar to 2-site DMRG, but computationally more efficient, closer to the performance of 1-site DMRG. The Controlled Bond Expansion (CBE) algorithm uses the Hamiltonian projected onto two sites, and then further projected onto the two-site tangent space, to extract a set of $k$ vectors that are used to expand the basis between the two sites. CBE achieves this with a complicated sequence of five singular value decompositions (SVDs), in order to project onto the 2-site tangent space and reduce the bond dimension of the tensor network such that the contraction can be done in time $O(dwD^3)$. In this Comment, we show that (1) the projection onto the 2-site tangent space is unnecessary, and is generally not helpful; (2) the sequence of 5 SVDs can be replaced by a single $QR$ decomposition (optionally with one SVD as well), making use of the randomized SVD (RSVD) with high accuracy and significantly improved efficiency, scaling as $O(dwkD^2)$ i.e., the most expensive operations are only quadratic in the bond dimension $D$ and linear in the number of expansion vectors $k$; (3) several statements about the variational properties of the CBE algorithm are incorrect, and the variational properties are essentially identical to existing algorithms including 2-site DMRG and single-site subspace expansion (3S); (4) a similar RSVD approach can be applied to the 3S algorithm, which leads to many advantages over CBE, especially in systems with long range interactions. We also make some comments on the benchmarking MPS algorithms, and the overall computational efficiency with respect to the accuracy of the calculation.</description>

      <title>Chiral Spin Liquid on a Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a topological chiral spin liquid in the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland Heisenberg model with an additional spin chirality interaction, using numerically unbiased exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods. We establish a quantum phase diagram where conventional phases, including dimer singlet, plaquette singlet, N{\' e}el and collinear phase, can be clearly identified by suitable local order parameters. Among them a $SU(2)_1$ chiral spin liquid emerges in the highly frustrated region, which is unambiguously identified by two topologically degenerate ground states, modular matrix, and characteristic level counting in entanglement spectrum, featuring the same topological order of $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin state. The phase boundaries among the different orders are determined by the energy level crossing analysis and wave function fidelity susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Emergence of interfacial magnetism in strongly-correlated nickelate-titanate superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated transition-metal oxides are widely known for their various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare-earth nickelates such as LaNiO$_{3}$, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO$_{3}$ into LaNiO$_{3}$ and is predicted to result in a high-spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x-ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we present direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO$_{3}$/LaTiO$_{3}$ interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilisation in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi-two-dimensional magnetic correlations and orbitally-polarized planar ligand holes make its electronic and magnetic configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an S $\rightarrow$ 1 spin state instead.</description>

      <title>Higher-group global symmetry and the bosonic M5 brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-group symmetries are combinations of higher-form symmetries which appear in various field theories. In this paper, we explain how higher-group symmetries arise in 10d and 11d supergravities when the latter are coupled to brane sources. Motivated by this observation, we study field theories at zero and finite temperature invariant under a class of continuous Abelian higher-group symmetries. We restrict the analysis to the low-energy regime where the dynamical field content exclusively consists of Goldstone fields arising from the spontaneous breaking of higher-group and spacetime symmetries. Invariant quantities are constructed and the phases of matter are classified according to the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With respect to supergravity, we highlight how such Goldstone effective theories provide a symmetry-based interpretation for the theories living on D/M-branes. As an explicit example we construct a 6-group invariant action for the bosonic M5 brane, consistent with the self-duality of the 3-form field strength on the brane. While the self-duality condition in the bosonic case needs to be imposed externally as a constraint at zero temperature, we find an equilibrium effective action for the bosonic M5 brane at finite temperature that inherently implements self-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moir\'e systems, we consider the possibility of realizing non-Abelian phases in topological minibands. We study a family of moir\'e systems, skyrmion Chern band (SCB) models, which can be realized in two-dimensional semiconductor/magnetic skyrmion heterostructures and also capture the essence of twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers. We show using many-body exact diagonalization that, in spite of strong Berry curvature variations in momentum space%and real-space emergent magnetic field, , the non-Abelian Moore-Read state can be realized at half filling of the second miniband. These results demonstrate the feasibility of non-Abelian fractionalization in moir\'e systems without Landau levels and shed light on the desirable conditions for their realization. In particular, we discuss the prospect of realizing the Moore-Read state at filling factor $\nu=3/2$ in twisted semiconductor bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An indispensable ingredient for pair density wave (PDW) superconductivity is the presence of an attractive pairing interaction at finite momentum. Here, we show how this condition can be met with straightforward electron-density interactions in multiband systems. The electron-density interaction, when projected to the band basis, acquires form factors with nontrivial momentum dependence and thereby exhibits a potential tendency to a finite-momentum pairing instability. By applying a mean-field analysis to two simple multiband models, the checkerboard lattice and three-band Hubbard model, we find that PDW order can indeed become the leading instability if a strong nearest-neighbour attraction is present. Moreover, the condition for the transition from a uniform superconductor to a PDW superconductor is shown via a simple quantum geometric argument.</description>

Abstract: Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study. Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by the small shift of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-abelian symmetries are thought to be incompatible with many-body localization, but have been argued to produce in certain disordered systems a broad non-ergodic regime distinct from many-body localization. In this context, we present a numerical study of properties of highly-excited eigenstates of disordered chains with SU(3) symmetry. We find that while weakly disordered systems rapidly thermalize, strongly-disordered systems indeed exhibit non-thermal signatures over a large range of system sizes, similar to the one found in previously studied SU(2) systems. Our analysis is based on the spectral, entanglement, and thermalization properties of eigenstates obtained through large-scale exact diagonalization exploiting the full SU(3) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the pyrochlore structure in rare-earth A2Ir2O7 iridates and pressure-induced structural transformation in IrO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the structural properties of the heavily investigated rare-earth A2Ir2O7 series under extreme conditions is presented. The series is covered by studying iridates with A = Pr, Sm, Dy-Lu. Temperature- and pressure-dependent synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction experiments reveal robustness of the pyrochlore structure throughout the rare-earth series, down to 4 K and up to 20 GPa. The thermal expansivity and pressure compressibility are determined, including Debye temperature, bulk modulus and Gr\"uneisen parameter. Temperature and pressure evolution of the fractional coordinate of oxygen at 48f Wyckoff position, the sole free atomic position parameter, is investigated and discussed regarding the antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ir magnetic moments. In addition, the pressure evolution of the crystal structure of an IrO2 minority phase is followed. The tetragonal rutile-type structure is orthorhombically distorted at 15 GPa, and the orthorhombic structure is not fully stabilised up to 20 GPa.</description>

      <title>Minority magnons and mode branching in monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we predict the existence of minority magnons in a monolayer of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ using first principles calculations. Minority magnons constitute a new type of collective magnetic excitations which increase the magnetic moment rather than lower it, contrary to ordinary (majority) magnons. The presence of such quasi-particles is made possible by the nontrivial ferromagnetic band structure of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ originating from its nonequivalent Fe sublattices. The result is a strong peak in the dynamic spin-raising susceptibility $\chi^{-+}(\omega)$ in the long wavelength limit, which is the hallmark of minority magnon physics. We calculate the susceptibility using time-dependent density functional theory and perform a detailed mode analysis, which allows us to separate and investigate the individual magnon modes as well as the Stoner excitations that constitute the many-body spectrum. For minority as well as majority magnons, the analysis reveals a plethora of magnetic excitations, which in addition to the standard main magnon branches include both satellite, valley and spin-inversion magnons, originating from the itinerancy of the ferromagnetic order. The physics underlying this analysis is in no way restricted to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, and minority magnons are expected to be observable in many complex ferromagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Mediated by Nematic Fluctuations in Tetragonal $\textrm{Fe}\textrm{Se}_{1-x}\textrm{S}_{x}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nematic phases, where electrons in a solid spontaneously break rotational symmetry while preserving the translational symmetry, exist in several families of unconventional superconductors [1, 2]. Although superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations is well established theoretically [3-7], it has yet to be unambiguously identified experimentally [8, 9]. A major challenge is that nematicity is often intertwined with other degrees of freedom, such as magnetism and charge order. The FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ family of iron based superconductors provides a unique opportunity to explore this concept, as it features an isolated nematic phase that can be suppressed by sulfur substitution at a quantum critical point (QCP) near $x_c = 0.17$, where nematic fluctuations are the largest [10-12]. Here, we performed scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements to visualize Boguliubov quasiparticle interference patterns, from which we determined the momentum structure of the superconducting gap near the Brillouin zone $\Gamma$ point of FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$. The results reveal an anisotropic, near nodal gap with minima that are $45^\circ$ rotated with respect to the Fe-Fe direction, characteristic of a nematic pairing interaction, contrary to the usual isotropic gaps due to spin mediated pairing in other tetragonal Fe-based superconductors. The results are also in contrast with pristine FeSe, where the pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations and the gap minima are aligned with the Fe-Fe direction. Therefore, the measured gap structure demonstrates not only a fundamental change of the pairing mechanism across the phase diagram of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, but it also indicates the existence of superconductivity mediated by nematic fluctuations in FeSe$_{0.81}$S$_{0.19}$.</description>

      <title>Dichotomous Dynamics of Magnetic Monopole Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent advance in the study of emergent magnetic monopoles was the discovery that monopole motion is restricted to dynamical fractal trajectories (J. Hall\'en et al, Science 378, 1218 (2022)) thus explaining the characteristics of magnetic monopole noise spectra (Dusad, R. et al. Nature 571, 234 (2019); Samarakoon, A. M. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 119, e2117453119 (2022)). Here we apply this new theory to explore the dynamics of field-driven monopole currents, finding them comprised of two quite distinct transport processes: initially swift fractal rearrangements of local monopole configurations followed by conventional monopole diffusion. This theory also predicts a characteristic frequency dependence of the dissipative loss-angle for AC-field-driven currents. To explore these novel perspectives on monopole transport, we introduce simultaneous monopole current control and measurement techniques using SQUID-based monopole current sensors. For the canonical material Dy2Ti2O7, we measure ${\Phi}(t)$, the time-dependence of magnetic flux threading the sample when a net monopole current $J(t) = \dot{\Phi}(t)/\mu_0$ is generated by applying an external magnetic field $B_0(t)$. These experiments find a sharp dichotomy of monopole currents, separated by their distinct relaxation time-constants before and after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$ from monopole current initiation. Application of sinusoidal magnetic fields $B_0(t) = Bcos({\omega}t)$ generates oscillating monopole currents whose loss angle ${\theta}(f)$ exhibits a characteristic transition at frequency $f \approx 1.8$ kHz over the same temperature range. Finally, the magnetic noise power is also dichotomic, diminishing sharply after $t \approx 600 {\mu}s$. This complex phenomenology represents a new form of heterogeneous dynamics generated by the interplay of fractionalization and local spin configurational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits for toric code and X-cube fracton model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic and efficient quantum circuit composed solely of Clifford gates for simulating the ground state of the surface code model. This approach yields the ground state of the toric code in $\lceil 2L+2+log_{2}(d)+\frac{L}{2d} \rceil$ time steps, where $L$ refers to the system size and $d$ represents the maximum distance to constrain the application of the CNOT gates. Our algorithm reformulates the problem into a purely geometric one, facilitating its extension to attain the ground state of certain 3D topological phases, such as the 3D toric model in $3L+8$ steps and the X-cube fracton model in $12L+11$ steps. Furthermore, we introduce a gluing method involving measurements, enabling our technique to attain the ground state of the 2D toric code on an arbitrary planar lattice and paving the way to more intricate 3D topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability. Our study provides a microscopic setting and thorough description of this novel SMS arising within a translation symmetry broken background.</description>

      <title>Probing Hilbert space fragmentation and the block inverse participation ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of quantum many-body Hamiltonians that show exact Hilbert space fragmentation in certain limits. The question arises whether fragmentation has implications for Hamiltonians in the vicinity of the subset defined by these exactly fragmented models, in particular in the thermodynamic limit. We attempt to illuminate this issue by considering distinguishable classes of transitional behavior between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes and employing a set of numerical observables that indicate this transition. As one of these observables we present a modified inverse participation ratio (IPR) that is designed to capture the emergence of fragmented block structures. We compare this block IPR to other definitions of inverse participation ratios, as well as to the more traditional measures of level-spacing statistics and entanglement entropy. In order to resolve subtleties that arise in the numerics, we use perturbation theory around the fragmented limit as a basis for defining an effective block structure. We find that our block IPR predicts a boundary between fragmented and nonfragmented regimes that is compatible with results based on level statistics and bipartite entanglement. A scaling analysis indicates that a finite region around the exactly fragmented limit is dominated by effects of approximate fragmentation, even in the thermodynamic limit, and suggests that fragmentation constitutes a phase. We provide evidence for the universality of our approach by applying it to a different family of Hamiltonians, that features a fragmented limit due to emergent dipole conservation.</description>

      <title>Particle-hole asymmetric ferromagnetism and spin textures in the triangular Hubbard-Hofstadter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a lattice model subject to a perpendicular magnetic field, when the lattice constant is comparable to the magnetic length, one enters the "Hofstadter regime," where continuum Landau levels become fractal magnetic Bloch bands. Strong mixing between bands alters the nature of the resulting quantum phases compared to the continuum limit; lattice potential, magnetic field, and Coulomb interaction must be treated on equal footing. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we study this regime numerically in the context of the Hubbard-Hofstadter model on a triangular lattice. In the field-filling phase diagram, we find a broad wedge-shaped region of ferromagnetic ground states for filling factor $\nu \leq 1$, bounded below by filling factor $\nu = 1$ and bounded above by half-filling the lowest Hofstadter subband. We observe signatures of SU(2) quantum Hall ferromagnetism at filling factors $\nu=1$ and $\nu=3$. The phases near $\nu=1$ are particle-hole asymmetric, and we observe a rapid decrease in ground state spin polarization consistent with the formation of skyrmions only on the electron doped side. At large fields, above the ferromagnetic wedge, we observe a low-spin metallic region with spin correlations peaked at small momenta. We argue that the phenomenology of this region likely results from exchange interaction mixing fractal Hofstadter subbands. The phase diagram derived beyond the continuum limit points to a rich landscape to explore interaction effects in magnetic Bloch bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stoner instability remains a cornerstone for understanding metallic ferromagnets. This instability captures the interplay of Coulomb repulsion, Pauli exclusion, and two-fold fermionic spin degeneracy. In materials with spin-orbit coupling, this fermionic spin is generalized to a two-fold degenerate pseudospin which is typically believed to have symmetry properties as spin. Here we identify a distinct symmetry of this pseudospin that forbids it to couple to a Zeeman field. This `spinless' property is required to exist in five non-symmorphic space groups and has non-trivial implications for superconductivity and magnetism. With Coulomb repulsion, Fermi surfaces composed primarily of this spinless pseudospin feature give rise to Stoner instabilities into magnetic states that are qualitatively different than ferromagnets. These spinless-pseudospin ferromagnets break time-reversal symmetry, have a vanishing magnetization, are non-collinear, and exhibit altermagnetic-like energy band spin-splittings. In superconductors, for all pairing symmetries and field orientations, this spinless pseudospin extinguishes paramagnetic limiting. We discuss applications to superconducting UCoGe and magnetic NiS$_{2-x}$Se$_x$.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on the long-time asymptotic behavior and the early-time spreading. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the dynamics of scrambling, covering the intermediate-time regime. Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system. Furthermore, by systematically scanning the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>

Abstract: The electronic state of \alpha-type organic Dirac fermion systems such as \alpha-(ET)_2I_3 or \alpha-(BETS)_2I_3 has been studied under magnetic fields using the four-band tight-binding model with Peierls phase factors. The validity of the Dirac fermion picture in these materials was confirmed by the generated Hofstadter butterfly and its Chern numbers. The four-component envelope function of the N = 0 Landau level with valley degeneracy was studied. It was found that the two degenerate valley states have different weights on A and A' molecules connected by inversion. This feature is also recognized for the N = 0 spin-split Landau levels under the Zeeman effect and the spin-orbit interaction. The spontaneous valley symmetry breaking in the N = 0 Landau levels due to the exchange interaction results in the \nu = 1 and -1 quantum Hall states accompanied by the spatial charge and spin modulations in a unit cell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Linear and Non-Linear Response of Quadratic Lindbladians</title>

Abstract: Quadratic Lindbladians encompass a rich class of dissipative electronic and bosonic quantum systems, which have been predicted to host new and exotic physics. In this study, we develop a Lindblad-Keldysh spectroscopic response formalism for open quantum systems that elucidates their steady-state response properties and dissipative phase transitions via finite-frequency linear and non-linear probes. As illustrative examples, we utilize this formalism to calculate the (1) density and dynamic spin susceptibilities of a boundary driven XY model at and near criticality, (2) linear and non-linear optical responses in Bernal bilayer graphene coupled to dissipative leads, and (3) steady state susceptibilities in a bosonic optical lattice. We find that the XY model spin density wavelength diverges with critical exponent 1/2, and there are gapless dispersive modes in the dynamic spin response that originate from the underlying spin density wave order; additionally the dispersing modes of the weak and ultra-strong dissipation limits exhibit a striking correspondence since the boundary dissipators couple only weakly to the bulk in both cases. In the optical response of the Bernal bilayer, we find that the diamagnetic response can decrease with increasing occupation, as opposed to in closed systems where the response increases monotonically with occupation; we study the effect of second harmonic generation and shift current and find that these responses, forbidden in centrosymmetric closed systems, can manifest in these open systems as a result of dissipation. We compare this formalism to its equilibrium counterpart and draw analogies between these non-interacting open systems and strongly interacting closed systems.</description>
