      <title>Metrics of Astrometric Variability in the International Celestial Reference Frame: I. Statistical analysis and selection of the most variable sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using very long baseline interferometry data for the sources that comprise the third International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3), we examine the quality of the formal source position uncertainties of ICRF3 by determining the excess astrometric variability (unexplained variance) for each source as a function of time. We also quantify multiple qualitatively distinct aspects of astrometric variability seen in the data, using a variety of metrics. Average position offsets, statistical dispersion measures, and coherent trends over time as explored by smoothing the data are combined to characterize the most and least positionally stable ICRF3 sources. We find a notable dependence of the excess variance and statistical variability measures on declination, as is expected for unmodeled ionospheric delay errors and the northern hemisphere dominated network geometries of most astrometric and geodetic observing campaigns.</description>

      <title>The Big Fringe Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Big Fringe Telescope (BFT) is a facility concept under development for a next-generation, kilometer-scale optical interferometer. Observations over the past two decades from routinely operational facilities such as CHARA and VLTI have produced groundbreaking scientific results, reflecting the mature state of the techniques in optical interferometry. However, routine imaging of bright main sequence stars remains a surprisingly unexplored scientific realm. Additionally, the three-plus decade old technology infrastructure of these facilities leads to high operations \&amp; maintenance costs, and limits performance. We are developing the BFT, based upon robust, modern, commercially-available, automated technologies with low capital construction and O\&amp;M costs, in support of kilometer-scale optical interferometers that will open the door to regular `snapshot' imaging of main sequence stars. Focusing on extreme angular resolution for bright objects leads to substantial reductions in expected costs through use of COTS elements and simplified infrastructure.</description>

      <title>MoonLITE: a CLPS-delivered NASA Astrophysics Pioneers lunar optical interferometer for sensitive, milliarcsecond observing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MoonLITE (Lunar InTerferometry Explorer) is an Astrophysics Pioneers proposal to develop, build, fly, and operate the first separated-aperture optical interferometer in space, delivering sub-mas science results. MoonLITE will leverage the Pioneers opportunity for utilizing NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) to deliver an optical interferometer to the lunar surface, enabling unprecedented discovery power by combining high spatial resolution from optical interferometry with deep sensitivity from the stability of the lunar surface. Following landing, the CLPS-provided rover will deploy the pre-loaded MoonLITE outboard optical telescope 100 meters from the lander's inboard telescope, establishing a two-element interferometric observatory with a single deployment. MoonLITE will observe targets as faint as 17th magnitude in the visible, exceeding ground-based interferometric sensitivity by many magnitudes, and surpassing space-based optical systems resolution by a factor of 50 times. The capabilities of MoonLITE open a unique discovery space that includes direct size measurements of the smallest, coolest stars and substellar brown dwarfs; searches for close-in stellar companions orbiting exoplanet-hosting stars that could confound our understanding and characterization of the frequency of Earth-like planets; direct size measurements of young stellar objects and characterization of the terrestrial planet-forming regions of these young stars; measurements of the inner regions and binary fraction of active galactic nuclei; and a probe of the very nature of spacetime foam itself. A portion of the observing time will also be made available to the broader community via a guest observer program. MoonLITE takes advantage of the CLPS opportunity and delivers an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and angular resolution at the remarkably affordable cost point of Pioneers.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Enhancing weak lensing redshift distribution characterization by optimizing the Dark Energy Survey Self-Organizing Map Photo-z method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of the redshift distribution of ensembles of galaxies is pivotal for large scale structure cosmological studies. In this work, we focus on improving the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) methodology for photometric redshift estimation (SOMPZ), specifically in anticipation of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6) data. This data set, featuring deeper and fainter galaxies than DES Year 3 (DES Y3), demands adapted techniques to ensure accurate recovery of the underlying redshift distribution. We investigate three strategies for enhancing the existing SOM-based approach used in DES Y3: 1) Replacing the Y3 SOM algorithm with one tailored for redshift estimation challenges; 2) Incorporating $\textit{g}$-band flux information to refine redshift estimates (i.e. using $\textit{griz}$ fluxes as opposed to only $\textit{riz}$); 3) Augmenting redshift data for galaxies where available. These methods are applied to DES Y3 data, and results are compared to the Y3 fiducial ones. Our analysis indicates significant improvements with the first two strategies, notably reducing the overlap between redshift bins. By combining strategies 1 and 2, we have successfully managed to reduce redshift bin overlap in DES Y3 by up to 66$\%$. Conversely, the third strategy, involving the addition of redshift data for selected galaxies as an additional feature in the method, yields inferior results and is abandoned. Our findings contribute to the advancement of weak lensing redshift characterization and lay the groundwork for better redshift characterization in DES Year 6 and future stage IV surveys, like the Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Direct Method to Compute Doppler Beaming Factors in Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13049419.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Sparse Photometry of Jupiter-Family Comet Nuclei in the LSST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at Vera C. Rubin Observatory will deliver high-quality, temporally-sparse observations of millions of Solar System objects on an unprecedented scale. Such datasets will likely enable the precise estimation of small body properties on a population-wide basis. In this work, we consider the possible applications of photometric data points from the LSST to the characterisation of Jupiter-family comet (JFC) nuclei. We simulate sparse-in-time lightcurve points with an LSST-like cadence for the orbit of a JFC between 2024-2033. Convex lightcurve inversion is used to assess whether the simulation input parameters can be accurately reproduced for a sample of nucleus rotation periods, pole orientations, activity onsets, shapes and sizes. We find that the rotation period and pole direction can be reliably constrained across all nucleus variants tested, and that the convex shape models, while limited in their ability to describe complex or bilobed nuclei, are effective for correcting sparse photometry for rotational modulation to improve estimates of nucleus phase functions. Based on this analysis, we anticipate that LSST photometry will significantly enhance our present understanding of the spin-state and phase function distributions of JFC nuclei.</description>

      <title>Advanced pure tilt actuator for testing tilt-to-length coupling in space-based gravitational wave detection</title>

Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling, caused by the jitter of test masses or satellites, is a significant noise source in space-based gravitational wave detection. Calibrating and suppressing TTL coupling noise at the sub-nanometer level is essential. One main challenge in current ground-based TTL coupling testing is the residual translational movement of the tilt actuator. This paper introduces the development of an advanced pure tilt actuator (APTA) specifically designed for testing TTL coupling. The APTA provides precise tilt motion and is monitored by a four-beam interferometer, which measures the displacement of attached array pyramids. We present a detailed theoretical model and experimental setup. Experimental results demonstrate that this optical test bed, equipped with the APTA, can achieve subnanometer-level TTL coupling calibration. In addition, a typical heterodyne interferometer was tested using the APTA test bed. Comparative testing demonstrated that the imaging system is capable of effectively suppressing TTL coupling errors. The TTL coupling coefficients were reduced from over plus-minus 30 micrometers per radian to within plus-minus 5 micrometers per radian across a range of plus-minus 200 microradians, meeting the preliminary requirements for the TianQin mission. This APTA test platform has the potential to be widely utilized for ground-based TTL coupling inspection.</description>

      <title>Real-time gravitational-wave inference for binary neutron stars using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) emit signals in both the gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Famously, the 2017 multi-messenger observation of GW170817 led to scientific discoveries across cosmology, nuclear physics, and gravity. Central to these results were the sky localization and distance obtained from GW data, which, in the case of GW170817, helped to identify the associated EM transient, AT 2017gfo, 11 hours after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing time-sensitive EM observations; however, due to challenges arising from the length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations that sacrifice accuracy. Here, we present a machine learning framework that performs complete BNS inference in just one second without making any such approximations. Our approach enhances multi-messenger observations by providing (i) accurate localization even before the merger; (ii) improved localization precision by $\sim30\%$ compared to approximate low-latency methods; and (iii) detailed information on luminosity distance, inclination, and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method open new opportunities for equation-of-state studies. Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to extremely long signals, up to an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.</description>
