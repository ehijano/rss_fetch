      <title>10 simple rules for data-model integration in theoretical ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical ecologists have long leveraged empirical data in various forms to advance ecology. Recently increased volumes and access to ecological data present an expanding set of opportunities for theoreticians to inform model development, framing, and interpretation. Whereas statisticians have collective guidance on best practices for data use, theoreticians might lack formal education on how to integrate diverse types of data into a single ecological model. As a group of predominantly early-career theoretical ecologists, we have developed guiding principles and practical tips to support theoretical ecologists in synthesizing multiple types of data at different phases of the modeling process. Our rules fall into three overarching themes: iteration in the data-model integration process, leveraging multiple sources of data), and understanding uncertainty. Across these rules, we emphasize that the data-model integration requires transparent, justifiable, and defensible communication of modeling choices to support readers in appropriately contextualizing the model and its implications.</description>

      <title>How many outbreaks before an epidemic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the finite-population behaviour of the Reed-Frost epidemic model. Our analysis relies on the exact expression for the final epidemic size, replaced by Monte Carlo simulations in cases where the exact formula becomes numerically unstable. When the initial reproduction number is greater than a critical threshold, the distribution of the final size becomes bimodal. We therefore define the probabilities of small and large outbreaks, providing an intuitive answer to the question posed in the title through simple arguments based on the geometric distribution. Finally, an agent-based simulation confirms that the Reed-Frost model offers a good approximation in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak.</description>

      <title>Age-structured model of dengue transmission dynamics with time-varying parameters, and its application to Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An age structured mathematical model with time dependent parameters is developed to investigate the dynamics of dengue transmission. Its properties are thoroughly analyzed in the first part of this work, as for example its disease free steady state, the corresponding effective reproduction numbers, its basic reproduction number (obtained via the Euler and Lotka equation and the next generation matrix approach). We also provide formulas for the time-varying effective reproduction number, and draw relations with the instantaneous growth rate. In the second part, we apply this model to Brazil and use weekly time series data from this country. Various medical parameters are firstly evaluated from these data, and an extensive numerical simulations for the period 2021 to 2024 is then carried out. Estimation of the transmission rates are derived both from epidemiological data and from environmental data such as temperature and humidity. The time-varying effective reproduction numbers are then estimated on these data, following the theoretical investigations performed in the first part. The sensitive parameters that significantly affect the model dynamics are presented graphically. Model predictions for following year by using different transmission rates are finally presented. Our findings show the importance of population age distribution, vector population dynamics, and climate, contributing to a deeper understanding of dengue transmission dynamics in Brazil.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector-Based Sensitivity Analysis of Contact Patterns in Epidemic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how age-specific social contact patterns and susceptibility influence infectious disease transmission is crucial for accurate epidemic modeling. This study presents an eigenvector-based sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the impact of age-structured interactions on disease spread. By applying perturbation analysis to the Next Generation Matrix, we reformulate the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, as a generalized eigenproblem, enabling the identification of key age group interactions that drive transmission. Using real-world COVID-19 contact data from Hungary, we demonstrate the framework's ability to highlight critical transmission pathways. We compare these findings with results obtained earlier using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we extend the analysis to contact structures in the UK and British Columbia, Canada, providing broader epidemiological insights. This work enhances our understanding of demographic interactions in epidemic propagation and offers a robust methodological foundation for improving infectious disease modeling and informing public health interventions.</description>
