      <title>Relationship between household attributes and contact patterns in urban and rural South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Households play a crucial role in the propagation of infectious diseases due to the frequent and prolonged interactions that typically occur between their members. Recent studies advocated for the importance of including socioeconomic variables in epidemic models to account for the heterogeneity induced by human behavior. While sub-Saharan Africa suffers the highest burden of infectious disease diffusion, limited efforts have been carried out to investigate the mixing patterns in the countries and their relation with social indicators. This work analyzes household contact matrices measured with wearable proximity sensors in a rural and an urban village in South Africa. Leveraging a rich data collection describing additional individual and household attributes, we investigate how the household contact matrix varies according to the household type (whether it is composed only of a familiar nucleus or by a larger group), the gender of its head (the primary decision-maker), the rural or urban context and the season in which it was measured. We show the household type and the gender of its head induce differences in the interaction patterns between household members, particularly regarding child caregiving. We argue the observed differences directly influence the basic reproductive number of an epidemic and should hence be accounted for the design of effective epidemic mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Stability of Zipf's law and occult spatial dependence effects: A study on the OECD countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22463v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spatial dependence in Zipf's law for cities among the OECD countries. The aim is to identify an upper tail of the distribution that follows a power law (Pareto) but is perturbed by spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by a coefficient with a significant minor or major deviation from a distribution corresponding to a (non-spatial) Zipf law. For that purpose, we augment the usual Pareto model with a spatial weight matrix and apply SEM/SAR regressions. The results for the OECD countries are mixed. In particular, we investigate the rank-size distribution of cities by estimating local Moran-I coefficients (LISA) along the city ranks to locate the causes of spatial dependence. As an example, we demonstrate the approach for Belgium, a medium-sized OECD country.</description>

      <title>Road-Width-Aware Network Optimisation for Bike Lane Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active mobility is becoming an essential component of the green transition in modern cities. However, the challenge of designing an efficient network of protected bike lanes without disrupting existing road networks for motorised vehicles remains unsolved. This paper focuses on the specific case of Milan, using a network approach that considers street widths to optimise the placement of dedicated bike lanes at the edges of the network. Unlike other network approaches in this field, our method considers the actual shapes of the streets, which introduces a realistic aspect lacking in current studies. We used these data to simulate cycling networks that maximise connectivity while minimising the impact of bike lane placement on the drivable network. Our mixed simulation strategies optimise for edge betweenness and width. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of dedicated bike lane infrastructure on the existing road network, demonstrating that it is feasible to create highly effective cycling networks with minimal disruption caused by lane width reductions. This paper illustrates how realistic cycling lanes can be simulated using road width data and discusses the challenges and benefits of moving beyond one-dimensional road data in network studies.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Technological Fitness and Coherence at different geographical scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debates over the trade-offs between specialization and diversification have long intrigued scholars and policymakers. Specialization can amplify an economy by concentrating on core strengths, while diversification reduces vulnerability by distributing investments across multiple sectors. In this paper, we use patent data and the framework of Economic Complexity to investigate how the degree of technological specialization and diversification affects economic development at different scales: metropolitan areas, regions and countries. We examine two Economic Complexity indicators. Technological Fitness assesses an economic player's ability to diversify and generate sophisticated technologies, while Technological Coherence quantifies the degree of specialization by measuring the similarity among technologies within an economic player's portfolio. Our results indicate that a high degree of Technological Coherence is associated with increased economic growth only at the metropolitan area level, while its impact turns negative at larger scales. In contrast, Technological Fitness shows a U-shaped relationship with a positive effect in metropolitan areas, a negative influence at the regional level, and again a positive effect at the national level. These findings underscore the complex interplay between technological specialization and diversification across geographical scales. Understanding these distinctions can inform policymakers and stakeholders in developing tailored strategies for technological advancement and economic growth.</description>

      <title>A Hard-Science Approach to Kondratieff's Economic Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an effort to evidence the Kondratieff cycle more scientifically than the way economists do, physical variables are studied rather than monetary indicators. Previously published graphs are reproduced and updated here with recent data. A cyclical rather regular variation of energy consumption reveals a 56-year cycle. A dozen human endeavors/phenomena, such as bank failures, homicides, hurricanes, feminism, and sunspot activity are shown to resonate with this cycle. Possible explanations for this phenomenon may have to do with a climatic variation or with the length of time any individual actively influences the environment. There is some evidence that the cycle may be getting shorter in amplitude and duration in recent years. All quantitative confidence levels involved in these observations are poor by scientific standards and permit critics to question the very existence of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Critical misalignments in climate pledges reveal imbalanced sustainable development pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the integration of climate action and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in nationally determined contributions (NDCs), revealing persistent synergies and trade-offs across income groups. While high-income countries emphasize systemic challenges like health (SDG3) and inequality (SDG10), low-income nations prioritize the water-energy-food nexus (SDGs 6-7-12) and natural resource management (SDG15) due to vulnerabilities to climate impacts. Harnessing an innovative artificial intelligence routine, we discuss what these diverging development trajectories imply for the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development in terms of global inequality, the climate and sustainable finance flows and multilateral governance.</description>
