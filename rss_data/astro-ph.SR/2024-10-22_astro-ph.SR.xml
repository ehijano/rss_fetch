      <title>The radiative-convective gap: fact or fiction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia characterizes the stellar populations of nearby open clusters with unprecedented precision. We investigate the B\"ohm-Vitense gap, which has been found as a prominent feature in the stellar sequence of open clusters. Using PARSEC isochrone fitting, we derive astrophysical parameters for more than 1100 stars in Praesepe, identify more than 1100 bona fide single stars in the alpha Persei (Melotte 20) open cluster, and confirm their approximate match in terms of age (approx. 710 Myr and 45 Myr) and metallicity ([M/H] approx. +0.15 dex and +0.13 dex) to the Hyades and Pleiades, respectively. By merging data of the cluster pairs, we improve number statistics. We do not find a clear gap in the combined observational G_abs vs. BP-RP color-magnitude diagram (CMD) in the stellar mass range corresponding to the location of the B\"ohm-Vitense gap. We reproduce gaps in simulated Hyades-type CMDs randomly drawn from an initial mass function. There is no strong evidence for a discontinuity originating in the transition from radiative to convective energy transport in the stellar photosphere. We conclude that the observed gaps in the stellar sequences of open clusters could be explained by small number statistics and the uneven mass-color relation at the transition from spectral type A to F.</description>

      <title>A Low Metallicity Massive Contact Binary Star System Candidate in WLM identified by Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present archival HST and JWST ultraviolet through near infrared time series photometric observations of a massive minimal-contact binary candidate in the metal-poor galaxy WLM ($Z = 0.14 Z_{\odot}$). This discovery marks the lowest metallicity contact binary candidate observed to date. We determine the nature of the two stars in the binary by using the eclipsing binary modeling software (PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs; PHOEBE) to train a neural network to fit our observed panchromatic multi-epoch photometry. The best fit model consists of two hot MS stars ($T_1=29800^{+2300}_{-1700}$ K, $M_1=16^{+2}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$, and $T_2=18000^{+5000}_{-5000}$ K, $M_2=7^{+5}_{-3}~M_{\odot}$). We discuss plausible evolutionary paths for the system, and suggest the system is likely to be currently in a contact phase before ultimately ending in a merger. Future spectroscopy will help to further narrow down evolutionary pathways. This work showcases a novel use of data of JWST and HST imaging originally taken to characterize RR Lyrae. We expect time series imaging from LSST, BlackGEM, etc. to uncover similar types of objects in nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>A study of sixty-one massive over-contact binary candidates from the OGLE survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive contact binaries are fundamental test-beds to study properties of close binaries en route to stellar mergers. Progress in their understanding has been largely impeded due to a dearth in their observed counterparts. We accumulate 61 over-contact binary candidates from the OGLE survey of the Magellanic Clouds and form the largest known sample of such systems. We mine the OGLE-IV catalogue for B-type and earlier systems which match our synthetic light curves, and thereafter examine their properties in comparison with our binary populations. Simultaneously, we also investigate the degeneracy in the light curves between over-contact and near-contact binaries and attempt to distinguish these populations. We construct new synthetic populations of such systems from detailed $\texttt{MESA}$ models with initial parameters of M$_\textrm{total,i}=14-80\,\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ and P$_\textrm{i}=0.6-23\,$days, and compute analogous $\texttt{PHOEBE}$ light curves. We then extract OGLE systems that match our synthetic light curves and compare their numbers, and distributions in periods, absolute V-band magnitudes and colours (V-I) with our population predictions. We expect massive over-contact binaries to have smooth equal-depth light curves due to their equal-mass ($q\approx1$) and consequently, equal-temperature components. We mine 47 and 14 predominantly B-type over-contact OGLE binaries from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds respectively, with periods of $\approx0.6-1\,$d, along with a few wider O-type systems. This sample is consistent with our theoretically expected numbers and colour-magnitude and period distributions. Additionally, we find that binaries nearing contact have periods as large as $4.5\,$d and mass ratios of $q\approx0.4-0.95$, some of which may masquerade as over-contact binaries and thereby lead to potential observational misclassifications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection-driven energization of protons up to 400 keV at the near-Sun heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of direct evidence of energetic protons being accelerated above ~400 keV within the reconnection exhaust of a heliospheric current sheet (HCS) crossing by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at a distance of ~16.25 solar radii (Rs) from the Sun. Inside the extended exhaust, both the reconnection-generated plasma jets and the accelerated protons propagated toward the Sun, unambiguously establishing their origin from HCS reconnection sites located beyond PSP. Within the core of the exhaust, PSP detected stably trapped energetic protons up to ~400 keV, which is approximately 1000 times greater than the available magnetic energy per particle. The differential energy spectrum of the accelerated protons behaved as a pure power-law with spectral index of about -5. Supporting simulations using the kglobal model suggest that the trapping and acceleration of protons up to ~400 keV in the reconnection exhaust is likely facilitated by merging magnetic islands with a guide field between ~0.2-0.3 of the reconnecting magnetic field, consistent with the observations. These new results, enabled by PSP's proximity to the Sun, demonstrate that magnetic reconnection in the HCS is a significant new source of energetic particles in the near-Sun solar wind. The discovery of in-situ particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection at the HCS provides valuable insights into this fundamental process which frequently converts the large magnetic field energy density in the near-Sun plasma environment and may be responsible for heating the sun's atmosphere, accelerating the solar wind, and energizing charged particles to extremely high energies in solar flares.</description>

      <title>Observing the evolution of the Sun's global coronal magnetic field over eight months</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field in the Sun's corona stores energy that can be released to heat the coronal plasma and drive solar eruptions. Measurements of the global coronal magnetic field have been limited to a few snapshots. We present observations using the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter, which provided 114 magnetograms of the global corona above the solar limb spanning approximately eight months. We determined the magnetic field distributions at different solar radii in the corona, and monitored the evolution at different latitudes over multiple solar rotations. We found varying field strengths from &lt;1 to 20 Gauss within 1.05-1.6 solar radii and a signature of active longitude in the coronal magnetic field. Coronal models are generally consistent with the observational data, with larger discrepancies in high-latitude regions.</description>

      <title>ExoMol line lists -- LXV. Mid-Infrared rovibronic spectroscopy of isotopologues of NiH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New line lists for four isotopologues of nickel monohydride, $^{58}$NiH, $^{60}$NiH, $^{62}$NiH, and $^{58}$NiD are presented covering the wavenumber range $&lt;10000$ cm$^{-1}$ ($\lambda &gt; 1$ $\mu$m), $J$ up to 37.5 for transitions within and between the three lowest-lying electronic states, ${X}\,^{2}\Delta$, ${W}\,^{2}\Pi$, and ${V}\,^{2}\Sigma^{+}$. The line lists are applicable for temperatures up to 5000 K. The line lists calculations are based on a recent empirical NiH spectroscopic model [Havalyova et al. J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat. Transf., 272, 107800, (2021)] which is adapted for the variational nuclear-motion code Duo. The model consists of potential energy curves, spin-orbit coupling curves, electronic angular momentum curves, spin-rotation coupling curves, $\Lambda$-doubling correction curve for $^2\Pi$ states and Born-Oppenheimer breakdown (BOB) rotational correction curves. New ab initio dipole moment curves, scaled to match the experimental dipole moment of the ground state, are used to compute Einstein A coefficients. The BYOT line lists are included in the ExoMol database at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Initial Composition on Massive Star Evolution and Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of presupernova evolution and supernova nucleosynthesis yields of massive stars to variations of the initial composition. We use the solar abundances from Lodders (2009), and compute two different initial stellar compositions: i) scaled solar abundances, and ii) the isotopic galactic chemical history model (GCH) developed by West and Heger (2013b). We run a grid of models using the KEPLER stellar evolution code, with 7 initial stellar masses, 12 initial metallicities, and two for each scaling method to explore the effects on nucleosynthesis over a metallicity range of $-4.0\leq[Z]\leq+0.3$. We find that the compositions from the GCH model better reproduce the weak \emph{s}-process peak than the scaled solar models. The model yields are then used in the OMEGA Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) code to assess this result further. We find that initial abundances used in computing stellar structure have more of an impact on GCE results than initial abundances used in the burn network, with the GCH model again being favored when compared to observations. Lastly, a machine learning algorithm was used to verify the free parameter values of the GCH model, which were previously found by West and Heger (2013b) using a stochastic fitting process. The updated model is provided as an accessible tool for further nucleosynthesis studies.</description>

      <title>Optical optimization of a multi-slit extreme ultraviolet spectrograph for global solar corona diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial-temporal evolution of coronal plasma parameters of the solar outer atmosphere at global scales, derived from solar full-disk imaging spectroscopic observation in the extreme-ultraviolet band, is critical for understanding and forecasting solar eruptions. We propose a multi-slits extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrograph for global coronal diagnostics with high cadence and present the preliminary instrument designs for the wavelength range from 18.3 to 19.8 nm. The instrument takes a comprehensive approach to obtain global coronal spatial and spectral information, improve the detected cadence and avoid overlapping. We first describe the relationship between optical properties and structural parameters, especially the relationship between the overlapping and the number of slits, and give a general multi-slits extreme-ultraviolet imaging spectrograph design process. Themultilayer structure is optimized to enhance the effective areas in the observation band. Five distantly-separated slits are set to divide the entire solar field of view, which increase the cadence for raster scanning the solar disk by 5 times relative to a single slit. The spectral resolving power of the optical system with an aperture diameter of 150 mm are optimized to be greater than 1461. The spatial resolution along the slits direction and the scanning direction are about 4.4''and 6.86'', respectively. The Al/Mo/B4C multilayer structure is optimized and the peak effective area is about 1.60 cm2 at 19.3 nm with a full width at half maximum of about 1.3 nm. The cadence to finish full-disk raster scan is about 5 minutes. Finally, the instrument performance is evaluated by an end-to-end calculation of the system photon budget and a simulation of the observational image and spectra. Our investigation shows that this approach is promising for global coronal plasma diagnostics.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Sample of Spectra of M-type Stars with Homogeneous Atmospheric-Parameter Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrepancies between theoretical and observed spectra, and the systematic differences between various spectroscopic parameter estimates, complicate the determination of atmospheric parameters of M-type stars. In this work, we present an empirical sample of 5105 M-type star spectra with homogeneous atmospheric parameter labels through stellar-label transfer and sample cleaning. We addressed systematic discrepancies in spectroscopic parameter estimates by adopting recent results for Gaia EDR3 stars as a reference standard. Then, we used a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise to remove unreliable samples in each subgrid of parameters. To confirm the reliability of the stellar labels, a 5-layer neural network was utilized, randomly partitioning the samples into training and testing sets. The standard deviations between the predicted and actual values in the testing set are 14 K for Teff , 0.06 dex for log g, and 0.05 dex for [M/H], respectively. In addition, we conducted an internal cross-validation to enhance validation and obtained precisions of 11 K, 0.05 dex, and 0.05 dex for Teff , log g, and [M/H], respectively. A grid of 1365 high Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) spectra and their labels, selected from the empirical sample, was utilized in the stellar parameter pipeline for M-Type stars (LASPM) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), producing an almost seamless Kiel distribution diagram for LAMOST DR10 and DR11 data. The atmospheric parameters for M-type stars from LAMOST DR11 show improved precision compared to the data from DR9, with improvements (for spectra with S/N higher than 10) from 118 to 67 K in Teff , 0.2 to 0.07 dex in log g, and 0.29 to 0.14 dex in [M/H].</description>

      <title>Interacting supernovae from wide mass-transferring binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light curves and spectra of many Type I and Type II supernovae (SNe) are heavily influenced by the interaction of the SN ejecta with circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. The observed diversity shows that many progenitors have undergone some level of stripping and polluted their CSM shortly before the explosion. The presence of a binary companion and the mass transfer that can ensue offers a mechanism that can give rise to this diversity. We present a set of detailed massive evolutionary models in which the donor star, a Red Supergiant (RSG) is in a wide orbit around a main-sequence companion, and undergoes stable or unstable mass transfer in the later stages of evolution, up to the moment of core collapse. We also discuss some significant physics of these systems that may impact our results, from the presence of pulsations and extended atmospheres in RSGs, to the initial eccentricity of the orbit. The resulting SN types range from Type IIP to H-deficient IIb and H-free Ib. In models undergoing stable mass transfer, the material lost during this process is expected to form a dense CSM surrounding the system by the time of core collapse and give rise to significant interaction effects in the SN light curve and spectra. In the systems with unstable mass transfer mass transfer, the SN may occur during common-envelope evolution. In this case, the progenitor may show significant variability in the last few thousand years before core collapse, and the following SN will likely exhibit strong interaction effects.</description>

      <title>Properties of magnetic null points associated with X-class flares during solar cycle 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in 2010 and throughout the solar cycle 24, the Sun has produced few tens of xclass flares, which are the most energetic solar events. Those flares are produced in regions where the magnetic flux/energy is large and the magnetic configurations are complex. To provide more insights into the flaring process, we investigate the properties of magnetic null points (MNPs) and their correlation with the energy release sites. During solar cycle 24, we identify 17 xclass flares satisfying selection criteria. From SDO/HMI magnetograms, we perform potential extrapolations around the peak time of the flare to access the 3D coronal magnetic field and thus investigate the existence of coronal MNPs. We then correlate the flaring sites with the existing MNPs using SDO/AIA 171A EUV observations, and deduce their properties (sign, spine, fan). Six active regions out of 10 possess at least one MNP, which is stable and with large magnetic field gradients: this implies that 35% of xclass flares are associated with a MNP; of which 87.5% of MNPs are of positive type. The MNPs associated with the flare sites are predominantly located ata height between 05 and 2 Mm, and with a vertical/radial spine field line. We also find a slight correlation between the MNPs not associated with a flare and negative-type MNPs (55%) within the active region. Regarding the physics of flares, the association between the enhanced intensity at the flaring site and a MNP represents about a third of the possible scenarios for triggering xclass flares.</description>

Abstract: IRAS 22568+6141 has been classified as a low-ionisation planetary nebula (PN) and presents non-thermal radio continuum emission, which could be a signature of nascent PNe. We present intermediate-resolution long-slit spectra obtained in 2021 and 2023, high-resolution long-slit spectra taken in 2023, and a light curve at the $r$-filter between 1953 and 2019, that reveal changes in IRAS 22568+6141 with timescales of decades and a few years. The object underwent an energetic event around 1990 that suddenly increased its brightness which has been fading since then. A comparison with a published spectrum from 1988 shows an increase of the H$\beta$ flux in 2021 by factor of $\simeq$6 and the [O III] emission lines that were absent in 1988. Between 2021 and 2023 the H$\beta$ flux decreased by a factor of $\simeq$1.7, and the [O III] emission lines almost vanished. These results and the variability observed in other emission lines indicate that IRAS 22568+6141 is recombining and cooling down between 2021 and 2023, and probably since 2005, as suggested by archival radio continuum and mid-IR observations. The intermediate- and high-resolution spectra show that the excitation of the emission lines is dominated by shocks in 2021 and 2023, and, probably, also in 1988, which may be related to the non-thermal radio continuum emission from the object. Although the variability might be due to changes in the physical conditions in the shocks or in a nova-like eruption, it accommodates better to that expected from a late thermal pulse, which is further suggested by a comparison with other similar objects. New observations and monitoring in the coming years are crucial to corroborate the origin of the variability.</description>

      <title>Opacity of Ejecta in Calculations of Supernova Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The plasma opacity in stars depends mainly on the local state of matter (the density, temperature, and chemical composition at the point of interest), but in supernova ejecta it also depends on the expansion velocity gradient, because the Doppler effect shifts the spectral lines differently in different ejecta layers. This effect is known in the literature as the expansion opacity. The existing approaches to the inclusion of this effect, in some cases, predict different results in identical conditions. In this paper we compare the approaches of Blinnikov (1996) and Friend and Castor (1983) - Eastman and Pinto (1993) to calculating the opacity in supernova ejecta and give examples of the influence of different approximations on the model light curves of supernovae.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Nova V1674 Herculis</title>

Abstract: Observational constraints on classical novae are heavily biased to phases near optical peak and later because of the simple fact that novae are not typically discovered until they become bright. The earliest phases of brightening, coming before discovery, are typically missed, but this is changing with the proliferation of wide-field optical monitoring systems including ZTF, ASAS-SN, and Evryscope. Here, we report on unprecedented observations of the fast nova V1674 Her beginning &gt;10 mag below its optical peak and including high-cadence (2 min.) observations that chart a rise of ~8 mag in just 5 hours. Two clear breaks are identified as the light curve transitions first from rising slowly to rising rapidly, followed by a transition to an even faster, nearly linear rate of increasing flux with time. The depths of the observations allow us to place tight constraints on the size of the photosphere under the assumption of blackbody emission from a white dwarf emitting at its Eddington luminosity. We find that the white dwarf was unlikely to have overflowed its Roche lobe prior to the launch of a fast wind, which poses a challenge for explaining the Fermi $\gamma$-ray detections as the interaction of a fast wind with a slow-torus of gas stripped from the inflated white dwarf envelope by the companion. High-cadence observations of novae from Evryscope and the planned Argus Array can record the diversity of rising nova light curves and help resolve how the interplay between thermonuclear fusion, binary interaction, and shocks power their earliest light.</description>

Abstract: Despite the recent discoveries of planets orbiting stars at all evolutionary stages, the evolution of planetary systems remains poorly understood. Studying planetary systems around red giant branch stars can reveal how main sequence planetary systems can change and evolve into white dwarf systems over time. Decades of radial velocity and transit surveys have yielded the detection of hundreds of planets and planet candidates orbiting evolved stars. These planetary systems have provided important insights into understanding how planetary atmospheres and orbits can be disrupted by stellar evolution, potentially being restructured at late stages, and how planets can be eventually engulfed by their stars, possibly reborn as white dwarf planetary systems. Evolved star targets will reveal planet occurrence at the largest distances and most varied environments across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Particle-In-Cell Simulations of Two-Dimensional Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present three-dimensional (3D) Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations to study the stability of 2D Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) modes in a magnetized plasma with a finite background magnetic field. The simulations were performed using the Plasma Simulation Code (PSC) [Germaschewski et al., J. of Comp. Phys. 318, 305 (2016)], as in our recent study using 2D PIC simulations [McClung et al., Phys. Plasmas 31, 042302 (2024)], in order to see if and how the previous results would change with 3D effects. We found that solutions that are stable (unstable) in 2D simulations are still stable (unstable) in the new 3D simulations. However, the instability develops slower in 3D than in 2D and forms an unstable spiral wave structure that is in-phase along the axial direction. We have also simulated cases with an electron density bump (EDB) at the center, in addition to cases with an electron density hole (EDH) considered in our previous study, and found differences in the unstable spiral wave structures between the two cases. Additionally, we have generalized our simulations to have an increased electron thermal velocity, as well as using initial conditions solved from the complete Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations. We found that these generalizations did not change the overall behavior of the simulations and the instability that evolves.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>

      <title>The star formation history of the first bulge fossil fragment candidate Terzan 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Terzan 5 and Liller 1 are the only bulge stellar clusters hosting multi-iron and multi-age stellar populations. They are therefore claimed to constitute a novel class of astrophysical objects: the fossils of massive star-forming clumps that possibly sank to the center of the Milky Way and contributed to the formation of the bulge. This is based on the hypothesis that the ancient clumps were able to retain iron-enriched supernova ejecta, later giving rise to younger and more metal-rich populations. Aims. A way to investigate this scenario is reconstructing their star formation histories (SFHs) and proving a prolonged and multi-episode star formation activity. Methods. Leveraging ground- and space-based high-resolution images, we derived the SFH of Terzan 5 by employing the color-magnitude diagram fitting routine SFERA. Results. The best-fit solution predicts an old, main peak occurred between 12 and 13 Gyr ago that generated 70 % of the current stellar mass, followed by a lower-rate star formation activity with two main additional bursts. Conclusions. These results indicate that Terzan 5, similarly to Liller 1, experienced a prolonged, multiepisode star formation activity, fueled by metal-enriched gas deposited in its central regions, in agreement with the expectations of a self-enrichment scenario in a primordial massive clump.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified injection model of short-lived radioisotopes in N-body simulations of star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research provides compelling evidence that the decay of short-lived radioisotopes (SLRs), such as 26Al, provided the bulk of energy for heating and desiccation of volatile-rich planetesimals in the early Solar System. However, it remains unclear whether the early Solar System was highly enriched relative to other planetary systems with similar formation characteristics. While the Solar System possesses an elevated level of SLR enrichment compared to the interstellar medium, determining SLR enrichment of individual protoplanetary disks observationally has not been performed and is markedly more difficult. We use N-body simulations to estimate enrichment of SLRs in star-forming regions through two likely important SLR sources, stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae. We vary the number of stars and the radii of the star-forming regions and implement two models of stellar wind SLR propagation for the radioisotopes 26Al and 60Fe. We find that for 26Al enrichment the Solar System is at the upper end of the expected distribution, while for the more supernovae dependent isotope 60Fe we find that the Solar System is comparatively very highly enriched. Furthermore, combined with our previous research, these results suggest that the statistical role of 26Al-driven desiccation on exoplanet bulk composition may be underestimated in typical interpretations of the low-mass exoplanet census, and that 60Fe is even less influential as a source of heating than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of the Si/O Interface in CCSN Explosions Using the Force Explosion Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova is a complex interplay between neutrino heating and cooling (including the effects of neutrino-driven convection), the gravitational potential, and the ram pressure of the infalling material. To analyze the post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the generalized Force Explosion Condition (FEC+), which succinctly formalizes the interplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent with realistic simulations. In this paper, we use the FEC+ to study the post-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is included through a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can significantly change the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion threshold. We systematically explore this by (i) artificially smoothing the pre-supernova density profile, and (ii) artificially varying the mixing length. In both cases, we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O interface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close to the explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O interface has a substantial effect on the critical condition for supernova explosions, contributing between 5\% and 15\%, depending on how pronounced the density contrast at the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection affects the critical condition by 25--30\%, which demonstrates that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable role in influencing shock dynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling of Hydrodynamics and Reactions in Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium for Modeling Convection in Massive Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build on the simplified spectral deferred corrections (SDC) coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to handle the case of nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) and electron/positron captures/decays in the cores of massive stars. Our approach blends a traditional reaction network on the grid with a tabulated NSE state from a very large, O(100) nuclei, network. We demonstrate how to achieve second-order accuracy in the simplified-SDC framework when coupling NSE to hydrodynamics, with the ability to evolve the star on the hydrodynamics timestep. We discuss the application of this method to convection in massive stars leading up to core-collapse. We also show how to initialize the initial convective state from a 1D model in a self-consistent fashion. All of these developments are done in the publicly available Castro simulation code and the entire simulation methodology is fully GPU accelerated.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Robust Stellar Rotation Periods catalog for 82771 Kepler stars using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework to predict stellar properties from light curves. We analyze the light-curve data from the Kepler space mission and develop a novel tool for deriving the stellar rotation periods for main-sequence stars. Using this tool, we provide rotation periods for more than 80K stars. Our model, LightPred, is a novel deep-learning model designed to extract stellar rotation periods from light curves. The model utilizes a dual-branch architecture combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer components to capture temporal and global data features. We train LightPred on self-supervised contrastive pre-training and simulated light curves generated using a realistic spot model. Our evaluation demonstrates that LightPred outperforms classical methods like the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) in terms of accuracy and average error. We apply LightPred to the Kepler dataset, generating the largest catalog to date. Using error analysis based on learned confidence and consistency metric, we were able to filter the predictions and remove stellar types with variability which is different than spot-induced variability. Our analysis shows strong correlations between error levels and stellar parameters. Additionally, we confirm tidal synchronization in eclipsing binaries with orbital periods shorter than 10 days. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning in extracting fundamental stellar properties from light curves, opening new avenues for understanding stellar evolution and population demographics.</description>

      <title>On the Acceleration of the Young Solar Wind from Different Source Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acceleration of the young solar wind is studied using the first 17 encounters of Parker Solar Probe. We identify wind intervals from different source regions: coronal hole (CH) interiors, streamers, and low Mach number boundary layers (LMBLs), i.e. the inner boundaries of coronal holes. We present their statistical trends in the acceleration process. Most of the observations can be reproduced by a two-fluid hydrodynamic model with realistic corona temperatures. In such a model, the solar wind is accelerated by the combined thermal pressures of protons and electrons,but it is mainly the difference in the proton pressure that leads to the difference in the solar wind speed. The proton pressure is the highest in the fastest CH wind, with a high initial proton temperature that decreases slowly. It is lower in the relatively slow LMBL wind, and the lowest in the slowest streamer wind. The proton temperature is quadratically correlated with the wind speed when scaled to the same distance. In contrast, the electron temperature shows no significant differences for different wind types or wind speeds, indicating more similar contributions from the electron pressure. The model gives reasonable locations for the sonic critical point, which is on average at 3.6-7.3 solar radii and can also extend to large distances when the proton temperature is extremely low, as in the LMBL wind. In addition to the thermal pressure, we raise the possibility that Alfv\'en waves may contribute to the solar wind acceleration, especially for the fast CH wind.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurements of Synchrotron-Emitting Electrons at Near-Sun Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under which they emit radiation. The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.</description>
