      <title>Topological phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene as a function of the twist angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) hosts a rich landscape of electronic phases arising from the interplay between strong electron-electron interactions and nontrivial band topology. While the flat bands near zero energy are central to many correlated phenomena, their interaction with higher-energy remote bands remains less understood. Here, we investigate these hybridization processes as a function of the twist angle and analyze their impact on the charge distribution, topological properties such as Chern number, quantum metric, and orbital magnetic energy. We identify multiple topological phase transitions between magic angles, driven by band inversions at high-symmetry points in momentum space. Notably, the central bands can exhibit phases with Chern numbers C = 2, revealing previously unreported topological states in TBG.</description>

      <title>Model-based study of a nanowire heating and dynamic axisymmetric necking by surface electromigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axisymmetric solid-state necking of a single-crystal metallic nanowire in a thermal contact with a substrate and subjected to a surface electromigration current is accompanied by a local current crowding and a sharp rise of a resistivity of a wire material in a thinning neck. This results in a temperature spike at the neck, which feedback affects the necking via thermomigration and the temperature-dependent surface diffusivity of the adatoms. A model that incorporates these effects and couples the nonlinear dynamics of a wire temperature and a wire radius for a necking wire is presented. Conditions on the physical parameters are derived that ensure a straight wire is in the solid state prior to an onset of a morphological instability that ultimately breaks a wire via a pinch-off. The impacts of a wire radius and a wire length on the temperature spike at the break junction are studied.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport and anti-super-Klein tunneling in few-layer black phosphorous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic transport in few-layer black phosphorus (FLBP) nanoribbons is studied theoretically. The system is modeled on the basis of band-structures, which have been measured recently by $\mu$-ARPES experiments. We show that the anisotropic bands of FLBP leads to highly anisotropic transport properties; while the current in one direction can be rather focused, it can be strongly disperse in the orthogonal direction. The low-energy current is carried mainly in the central layer due to the vertical confinement of the electrons. In FLBP pn junctions, generated by the electrostatic potential of a gate contact in a certain region of the system, the electrons pass through the interface of the junction, if it is oriented along the zigzag direction of FLBP. If the junction is rotated by 90 degree and oriented along the armchair direction, the current is reflected completely for all angles of incidence and for a wide range of electron energies. This omni-directional total reflection is named anti-super-Klein tunneling as it is due to opposite pseudo-spins of the electrons in the two region of the pn junction. The effect of oxidation of the top layer of FLBP pn junctions is investigated and it is found that, while the current flow in the top layers is strongly suppressed, the anti-super-Klein tunneling persists.</description>

      <title>The role of electron interactions in a failed insulator revealed by shot noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials known as failed insulators, electrical resistivity increases as temperature decreases, yet does not diverge - a phenomenon inconsistent with single-particle theories. We investigate the origin of this behavior by measuring shot noise in nanojunctions of nitrogen-doped beta-Ta, a prototypical failed insulator. Junctions as short as 8 nanometers exhibit hot-electron shot noise, indicating strong electron interactions. We show that charge hopping mediated by these interactions explains the anomalous electronic properties. Our findings open new avenues for exploiting electron interactions in spin-orbitronic and superconducting applications of failed insulators.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of locally modified excitonic effect within a moir\'e unit cell in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilayer graphene, forming moir\'e superlattices, possesses distinct electronic and optical properties derived from the hybridization of energy band and the emergence of van Hove singularities depending on its twist angle. Extensive research has been conducted on the global characteristics of moir\'e superlattice induced by long-range periodicity. However, limited attention has been given to the local properties within a moir\'e unit cell, which undoubtedly differ due to the variations in three-dimensional atomic arrangement. Here we demonstrate the highly localized excitations of carbon 1s electrons to unoccupied van Hove singularities in a twisted bilayer graphene using an electron energy loss spectroscopy based on a monochromated transmission electron microscope. The core-level excitations associated with the van Hove singularities show a systematic twist angle dependence which is analogous to the optical excitations. Furthermore, local variations in those core-level van Hove singularity peaks within a moir\'e unit cell have been corroborated for the first time, which can originate from core-exciton lifetimes and band modifications influenced by the local stacking geometry.</description>

      <title>Spin transport phenomena in junctions composed of a compensated ferrimagnet and a normal metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets and compensated ferrimagnets have attracted considerable attention as key building blocks in spintronics devices, owing to their dual advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. In particular, compensated ferrimagnets exhibit isotropic spin splitting in their electronic and magnon dispersions, despite having zero net magnetization. This characteristic feature enables spin transport phenomena analogous to those in ferromagnets. However, quantitative evaluations of such spin transport phenomena, particularly in comparison to conventional ferromagnets, remain unexplored. Here we investigate spin pumping and spin Seebeck effects in a junction between a compensated ferrimagnet and a normal metal using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. We find that the isotropic spin splitting in magnon dispersions gives rise to spin transport phenomena similar to those observed in ferromagnets. Our results provide a solid theoretical foundation for the applications of exotic collinear antiferromagnets with spin splitting to spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Detecting Lifshitz Transitions Using Nonlinear Conductivity in Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order nonlinear electrical response (NLER) is an intrinsic property of inversion symmetry-broken systems which can provide deep insights into the electronic band structures of atomically thin quantum materials. However, the impact of Fermi surface reconstructions, also known as Lifshitz transitions, on the NLER has remained elusive. We investigated NLER in bilayer graphene (BLG), where the low-energy bands undergo Lifshitz transitions. Here, NLER undergoes a sign change near the Lifshitz transitions even at elevated temperatures $T\gtrsim10~$K. At the band edge, NLER in BLG is modulated by both extrinsic scattering and interfacial-strain-induced intrinsic Berry curvature dipole, both of which can be finely tuned externally by varying doping and interlayer potential. Away from the band edge, BLG exhibits second-order conductivity exceeding $30~\mu$mV$^{-1}\Omega^{-1}$ at 3K higher than any previous report. Our work establishes NLER as a reliable tool to probe Lifshitz transitions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Coherent superposition of emitted and resonantly scattered photons from a two-level system driven by an even-$\pi$ pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a bunching of ~3 photon states, which is a coherent superposition of emitted photons and resonantly scattered laser photons, arising upon excitation by even-$\pi$ pulses of a two-level system represented by a charged quantum dot in a microcavity. This phenomenon emerges because the exciting laser pulse contains several tens of photons whose quantum amplitude distribution creates such a superposition, and the polarization of the scattered photons is changed by the interaction with the charged resonant system. Such a beam is a high-order member of the Fock space, promising for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Conductivity Probes a Cascade of Singularities in a Moir\'e Superlattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems lacking inversion symmetry inherently demonstrate a nonlinear electrical response (NLER) to an applied electric bias, emerging through extrinsic mechanisms. This response is highly sensitive to the electronic band structure, which can be engineered with remarkable precision in moir\'e superlattices formed from atomically thin quantum materials. Moir\'e superlattices host complex Fermi surface reconstructions near van Hove singularities (vHSs) in the electronic density of states. However, the role of these reconstructions in shaping NLER remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we systematically explore NLER in moir\'e superlattices of twisted double bilayer graphene (tDBLG) by tuning the Fermi level across multiple moir\'e bands on both sides of the charge neutrality point. We observe sharp variations and sign reversals in the NLER appearing via extrinsic pathways near mid-band vHSs. The second-order conductivity close to the vHSs demonstrates a much higher value than previous reports of extrinsic NLER in any other material. Our results demonstrate that NLER can serve as a sensitive probe of Fermi surface reconstructions and establish tDBLG as a versatile and highly efficient platform for generating and controlling the nonlinear electrical response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in quantum magnonics is driving the development of advanced techniques for generating, controlling, and detecting non-classical magnonic states. Here, we explore the potential of an ensemble of solid-state spin defects coupled to a shared magnetic bath as a source of such states. We establish a theoretical framework to characterize the quantum correlations among magnons emitted by the ensemble into the bath and investigate how these correlations depend on experimentally tunable parameters. Our findings show that the emitted magnons retain the quantum correlations inherent to the solid-state emitters, paving the way for the deterministic generation of quantum many-body magnonic states.</description>

      <title>Spin properties in droplet epitaxy-grown telecom quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin properties of InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots grown by metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) deposition using droplet epitaxy, which emit in the telecom C-band. Using pump-probe Faraday ellipticity measurements, we determine electron and hole $g$-factors of $|g_e| = 0.934$ and $|g_h| = 0.471$, with the electron $g$-factor being nearly twice as low as typical molecular beam epitaxy Stranski-Krastanov (SK) grown samples. Most significantly, we measure a longitudinal spin relaxation time $T_1 = 2.95\,\mu s$, representing an order of magnitude improvement over comparable MBE SK grown samples. Despite significant electron $g$-factor anisotropy, we observed that it is reduced relative to similar material composition samples grown with MBE or MOVPE SK methods. We attribute these g-factor anisotropy and spin lifetime improvements to the enhanced structural symmetry achieved via MOVPE droplet epitaxy, which mitigates the inherent structural asymmetry in strain-driven growth approaches for InAs/InP quantum dots. These results demonstrate that MOVPE droplet epitaxy-grown InAs/InGaAs/InP quantum dots exhibit favorable spin properties for potential implementation in quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>"Ideal" Topological Heavy Fermion Model in Two-dimensional Moir\'e Heterostructures with Type-II Band Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological flat bands play an essential role in inducing exotic interacting physics, ranging from fractional Chern insulators to superconductivity, in moir\'e materials. When topological flat bands possess concentrated quantum geometry, a topological heavy fermion (THF) model was proposed as the starting point to describe the interacting moir\'e physics. In this work, we propose a design principle for realizing "ideal" THF model, which can host an exact flat band with "ideal quantum geometry", namely the trace of Fubini-Study metric equals to the Berry curvature, in a class of two-dimensional moir\'e heterostructures with type-II band alignment. We first introduce a moir\'e Chern-band model to describe this system and show that topological flat bands can be realized in this model when the moir\'e superlattice potential is stronger than the type-II atomic band gap of the heterostructure. Next, we map this model into a THF model that consists of a localized orbital for "f-electron" and a conducting band for "c-electron". We find that both the flatness and quantum geometry of the mini-bands in this THF model depend on the energy gap between c-electron and f-electron bands at $\Gamma$ which is experimentally controllable via external gate voltages. This tunability will allow us to realize an "ideal" topological flat band with zero band-width and "ideal quantum geometry" in this THF model. Our design strategy of topological flat bands is insensitive of twist angle. We also discuss possible material candidates for moir\'e heterostructures with type-II band alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum electronic fluids with spin and valley degrees of freedom have a correlation driven tendency to flavor polarization (generalized ferromagnetism). To first order in the long-range Coulomb interactions -- i.e. in the Hartree-Fock approximation -- spin and valley polarization exhibit a spurious degeneracy. We show that to second order -- or more generally in the random-phase approximation -- this degeneracy is lifted in a way that depends only on the underlying symmetry relating the two valleys. In two spatial dimensions, if the valleys are related by an $n-$fold rotation ($n&gt;2$) or by mirror reflection and each valley is invariant under $C_2$ or time reversal (as is the case in AlAs quantum wells) then valley polarization is preferred. If the valleys are related by time reversal or by $C_2$ rotation symmetry (as in multilayer graphene systems) then spin order is selected.</description>

      <title>Proximity effect and p-wave superconductivity in s-wave superconductor/helimagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that in contrast to homogeneous ferromagnetism helical magnetism is compatible with superconductivity and causes only weak suppressive effect on superconducting critical temperature. Despite this fact it induces p-wave triplet superconducting correlations in homogeneous superconducting systems with intrinsic helical magnetism. The combination of these two facts indicates a high potential for the application of such systems in disspationless spintronics. For this reason here we investigate the proximity effect in atomically thin superconductor/helical (conical) magnet heterostructures (SC/HM). It is shown that in SC/HM heterostructures the strength of the proximity effect and, in particular, amplitude of p-wave triplet superconductivity and the degree of superconductivity suppression are complex functions of the magnet exchange field and filling factors of the magnet and the superconductor. Further we demonstrate that $p$-wave correlations ensure transport spin supercurrent flow in the SC/HM heterostructure with conical magnets and unveil the physical relationship between the transport spin supercurrent, degree of the magnet conicity and internal structure of p-wave correlations in the momentum space.</description>

Abstract: Strong coupling in the conventional sense requires that the Rabi cycling process between two interacting states is faster than other dissipation rates. Some recent experimental findings show intriguing properties that were attributed to polaritonic states (e.g., plexcitons) even though the above criterion is not satisfied. Here, we theoretically predict and provide experimental evidence of polariton-like behavior in a system that does not show Rabi splitting. The photoluminescence of an exciton-cavity system consisting of a two-dimensional exciton monolayer (tungsten disulfide, WS2) coupled to a planar, open, one-mirror optical cavity configuration is studied. We experimentally observed a transition from the weak coupling regime crossing an exceptional point to form polariton-like states by varying the coupling strength and the cavity loss. Our observations are fully in agreement with a theoretical quasi-normal mode analysis, which predicts this transition and confirms the presence of exceptional points in the system. These results provide evidence that polaritonic effects can be experimentally observed even when the conventional strong coupling condition is not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Defect migration and phase transformations in 2D iron chloride inside bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intercalation of metal chlorides, and particularly iron chlorides, into graphitic carbon structures has recently received lots of attention, as it can not only protect this two-dimensional (2D) magnetic system from the effects of the environment, but also substantially alter the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties of both intercalant and host material. At the same time, the intercalation can result in the formation of structural defects, or defects can appear under external stimuli, which can affect materials performance. These aspects have received so far little attention in the dedicated experiments. In this study, we investigate the behavior of atomic-scale defects in iron chlorides intercalated into bilayer graphene (BLG) by using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and first-principles calculations. We observe transformations between the FeCl2 and FeCl3 phases and elucidate the role of defects in the transformations. Specifically, three types of defects are identified: Fe vacancies in FeCl2 domains, Fe adatoms and interstitials in FeCl3 domains, each exhibiting distinct dynamic behaviors. We also observed a crystalline phase with an unusual stoichiometry of Fe5Cl18 which has not been reported before. Our findings not only advance the understanding of intercalation mechanism of 2D materials but also highlight the profound impact of atomic-scale defects on their properties and potential technological applications.</description>

      <title>Sensing with Broken Symmetry: Revisiting Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface with bound states in the continuum (BICs) offer exceptional potential for optical sensing due to their inherently high quality (Q) factors. However, the detection of symmetry-protected BICs remains experimentally challenging due to their non-radiative nature. Introducing slight asymmetry makes these resonances observable, though it reduces the Q-factor. In real devices, intrinsic material losses further affect the resonance behavior and sensing performance. While it is often assumed that sensing is optimized at the critical coupling when radiative and non-radiative losses are balanced, the precise conditions for achieving the best limit of detection (LOD) and figure-of-merit (FOM) remain under active discussion. In this work, we experimentally and theoretically investigate BIC-based sensing in the terahertz (THz) range. We demonstrate that the LOD exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on asymmetry, reaching an unexpected optimum where radiative and non-radiative losses are not equal. Moreover, we show that this optimum differs between reflection and transmission sensing schemes. Our results provide practical guidelines for optimizing Q-factor, sensitivity, and signal amplitude together, and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of BIC-based sensing.</description>

      <title>Unified Statistical Theory of Heat Conduction in Nonuniform Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of heat conduction that encompasses and extends the classical paradigm defined by Fourier law and the Kapitza interfacial conductance model. Derived from the Zwanzig projection operator formalism, our approach introduces a spatiotemporal kernel function of heat conduction, which governs the spatiotemporal response of the local heat flux in nonuniform media to surrounding temperature gradients while incorporating temporal memory effects. Our statistical analysis shows that memory, nonlocality, and interfacial temperature discontinuities emerge naturally from the microscopic coupling between two classes of irrelevant degrees of freedom: flux mode and nonlocal mode variables. Although these irrelevant variables are not directly observable at the macroscopic level, their integrated influence on the heat flux is fully encoded in the kernel function. In the diffusive limit, the kernel recovers and generalizes Fourier law by replacing the thermal conductivity with an infinite hierarchy of position dependent higher order tensors that capture nanoscale nonlocality. We also outline atomistic strategies for computing the spatiotemporal kernel in various classes of material media, enabling predictive modeling of heat transport in structurally complex and compositionally inhomogeneous systems. These include nanostructured, anisotropic, and interfacial materials where classical local models break down. Finally, the kernel function formalism is extensible to electronic, spin, or magnetic systems, providing a broadly applicable platform for next generation transport theory at ultrafast and nanoscale regimes.</description>

      <title>Concurrent Skin-scale-free Localization and Criticality under M\"obius Boundary Conditions in a Non-Hermitian Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under M\"obius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Growth Dynamics of Size-selected Carbon Atomic Wires with in situ UV Resonance Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short carbon atomic wires, the prototypes of the lacking carbon allotrope carbyne, represent the fundamental one-dimensional system and the first stage in carbon nanostructure growth, which still exhibits many open points regarding their growth and stability. We introduce an in situ UV resonance Raman approach for real-time monitoring of the growth of carbon atomic wires during pulsed laser ablation in liquid without perturbing the synthesis environment. We track single-chain species' growth dynamics, achieving size selectivity by exploiting the peculiar optoelectronic properties of carbon wires and the tunability of synchrotron radiation. We systematically explore diverse solvents, finding size- and solvent-dependent production rates linked to the solvent's C/H ratio and carbonization tendency. Carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics reveal a complex interplay between formation and degradation, leading to an equilibrium. Water, lacking in carbon atoms and reduced polyynes' solubility, yields fewer wires with rapid saturation. Organic solvents exhibit enhanced productivity and near-linear growth, attributed to additional carbon from solvent dissociation and low relative polarity. Exploring the dynamics of the saturation regime provides new insights into advancing carbon atomic wires' synthesis via PLAL. Understanding carbon atomic wires' growth dynamics can contribute to optimizing PLAL processes for nanomaterial synthesis.</description>

      <title>Wave/particle duality in monitored Jaynes--Cummings resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance, arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation, at the expense of its temporal symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Chiral superconductors are sought after for their promising but elusive Majorana zero modes. We show that a one-dimensional semiconductor in proximity to a conventional superconductor and a helical magnet can exhibit chiral superconductivity, without the need for external magnetic fields or intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. The effective proximity-induced gap and the triplet gap arising from magnon fluctuations can be made to interfere constructively. The heterostructure can be tuned into a topological regime with Majorana zero modes at its ends, over a range of chemical potentials proportional to the spin-electron coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions.Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable, error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

Abstract: An ensemble of electrons trapped above superfluid helium offers a paradigm system for investigating and controlling collective charge dynamics in low-dimensional electronic matter. Of particular interest is the ability to spatially control and engineer surface plasmons for integration with hybrid quantum systems and circuit quantum electrodynamic device architectures. Here we present experiments using an electron-on-helium microchannel device that hosts microwave-frequency plasmons, generated via local microwave excitation in an electrostatically defined central channel. By precisely varying the electron density, we demonstrate tunability of plasmon mode frequencies over several GHz. Additionally, we find that the power dependence of these modes can be used to investigate both homogeneous and inhomogeneous sources of spectral broadening. These results demonstrate the versatility of electrons on helium for probing collective excitations in low-dimensional Coulomb liquids and solids, and demonstrate a path for integrating engineered plasmons in electrons on helium with hybrid circuit quantum electrodynamic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stacking monolayer semiconductors into heterostructures allows for control of their optical and electronic properties, offering advantages for nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. Specifically, adding a thin spacer between monolayers can yield bulk materials that retain interesting monolayer properties, such as a direct bandgap and a high emission quantum efficiency. The interaction mechanisms between monolayers, including interlayer coupling, charge transfer, and energy transfer, might be tuned through subnanometric control over the spacer thickness. Traditional spacer materials like bulk oxides or other layered materials can suffer from poor material interfaces or inhomogeneous thickness over large areas. Here, we use a spin-cast organic molecular spacer to adjust interlayer coupling in WS$_2$ monolayer stacks. We vary the molecular spacer thickness to tune the interlayer distance, significantly altering the optical properties of the resulting organic-inorganic heterostructures. Additionally, we demonstrate a dependence of the valence-band splitting on molecular spacer thickness manifested as a change in the energy difference between A and B excitons resulting from spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions. Our results illustrate the potential of molecular spacers to tailor the properties of monolayer heterostructures. This accessible approach opens new routes to advance atomically thin devices and could enable sensing technologies at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Berry curvature-induced transport signature for altermagnetic order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been detected in several materials using spin-sensitive probes. These measurements require rather complex setups that make it challenging to track variations in altermagnetic order, e.g., to identify a temperature-tuned altermagnetic phase transition. We propose a simple transport measurement that can probe the order parameter for $d$-wave altermagnetism. We suggest magnetoconductivity anisotropy -- the difference between the two principal values of the magnetoconductivity tensor. This quantity can be easily measured as a function of temperature, without any spin-selective apparatus. It acquires a nonzero value in a $C_4K$ phase, where $C_4$ rotations and time reversal $K$ are not symmetries but their combination is. This effect can be traced to the modification of phase space density due to Berry curvature, which we demonstrate using semiclassical equations of motion for band electrons. As an illustration, we build a minimal tight-binding model with altermagnetic order that breaks $C_4$ and $K$ symmetries while preserving $C_4K$.</description>

Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>

Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and error-resilient variational quantum noise spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing robust quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors operating at molecular scales. However, current noise spectroscopies rely on severe approximations that sacrifice accuracy and precision. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations. It self-consistently extracts noise spectra that characterize the interactions between a quantum sensor and its environment from commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is resilient to measurement errors. We quantify confidence intervals and sensitivity measures to identify experiments that improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that previous measurements had overestimated the strength of low-frequency noise by an order of magnitude. Our method uncovers previously hidden structure with unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency pairing due to Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states are predicted to appear in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid systems, but their identification is still a challenging task. Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev bound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are subjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy Andreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the normal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve into Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a function of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical Andreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the emergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair amplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime, trivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays in the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal region. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes in the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage into the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states are truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent low-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated Majorana signature. Our results help understand Majorana and trivial Andreev states from a superconducting correlations perspective in Majorana devices.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of Schr\"odinger cat states in light of wave/particle duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We challenge the standard picture of decohering Schr\"odinger cat states as an ensemble average obeying a Lindblad master equation, brought about locally from an irreversible interaction with an environment. We generate self-consistent collections of pure system states correlated with specific environmental records, corresponding to the function of the wave-particle correlator first introduced in Carmichael {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1855 (2000)]. In the spirit of Carmichael {\it et al.} [Coherent States: Past, Present and Future, pp. 75--91, World Scientific (1994)], we find that the complementary unravelings evince a pronounced disparity when the ``position'' and ``momentum'' of the damped cavity mode -- an explicitly open quantum system -- are measured. Intensity-field correlations may largely deviate from a monotonic decay, while Wigner functions of the cavity state display contrasting manifestations of quantum interference when conditioned on photon counts sampling a continuous photocurrent. In turn, the conditional photodetection events mark the contextual diffusion of both the net charge generated at the homodyne detector, and the electromagnetic field amplitude in the resonator.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $\nu{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineering Weyl Points and Linked Fermi Arcs from Straight Nodal Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering provides a powerful and flexible method for modifying the band structures of quantum materials. While circularly polarized light has been shown to convert curved nodal lines in three-dimensional semimetals into Weyl points, such a transformation is forbidden for an isolated straight nodal line. In this work, we uncover a dramatic shift in this paradigm when multiple straight nodal lines intersect. We observe that circularly polarized light not only gaps them into Weyl points but also induces unprecedented surface-state Fermi arcs that extend across the entire surface Brillouin zone and form a linked topological structure. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of light-driven transitions in topological semimetals and unveil a unique Weyl semimetal phase defined by linked Fermi arcs. We discuss potential exotic phenomena arising from this phase, applications of our predictions to spin-splitting antiferromagnets, and the extension of this Weyl semimetal phase to classical systems.</description>
