      <title>Understanding the Influence of Rheological Properties of Shear-Thinning Liquids on Segmented Flow in Microchannel using CLSVOF Based CFD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, two phase gas-shear-thinning liquid flow in a square microchannel is numerically investigated using the coupled level set and volume of fluid (CLSVOF) methods. A systematic investigation is carried out to explore the influence of polyacrylamide (PAM) concentration, surface tension, velocity ratios, and contact angle on the gas slug length, volume, unit cell length, and pressure drop. Three different concentrations of PAM solutions, which exhibit shear-thinning behaviour are considered as the continuous phase. Gas slug length, volume, and unit cell length decreased with increasing the PAM concentration. Velocity and non-homogeneous viscosity distributions in the liquid slug for three different PAM concentration solutions are reported. Gas slug length decreases with an increase of the contact angle and the bubble shape change from convex to concave. This numerical work provides the fundamental insights in segmented flow formation and two-phase flow characteristics comprising shear-thinning liquids.</description>

      <title>An investigation into the combined effect of steady and pulsatile flow within a wavy channel filled with an anisotropic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an analytical solution to examine the impact of steady and pulsatile flow in a symmetric wavy channel filled with an anisotropic porous medium. The flow inside the wavy channel with a porous substrate is governed by the Darcy-Brinkman equation. We used the perturbation approach to ascertain the solution to the problem, assuming that the ratio between the channel width and the wavelength is very small (i.e., $\delta^2 \ll 1$). We solved the problem up to $O(\delta^2)$ by assuming $\lambda^2 \delta^2 \ll 1$, where $\lambda$ is the ratio of anisotropic permeability. Our primary objective is to investigate how the anisotropic permeability ratio influences flow reversal near the crest and trough of a wavy wall under both steady flow conditions and when a pulsatile component is superimposed on the steady flow. In the case of steady flow, flow separation occurs near the crest region of the wavy wall, leading to the formation of recirculating zones where fluid becomes trapped. In contrast, for pulsatile flow as well as combined effects of steady and pulsatile flow, vortices form transiently at certain phases of the pulsation cycle. Subsequently, these vortices bulge into the mainstream, resulting in a complete backflow. We explored the approximate flow reversal zone using Darcy's approximation theory far from the wavy wall. The flow recirculation associated with steady flow is critical for mass transport and enhances convective mixing. On the other hand, flow reversal at different time instances can optimize oxygen transfer in devices such as membrane oxygenators.</description>

      <title>Intelligent backpropagated neural networks application on Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity in a composite porous channel filled with an anisotropic porous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines Couette-Poiseuille flow of variable viscosity within a channel that is partially filled with a porous medium. To enhance its practical relevance, we assume that the porous medium is anisotropic with permeability varying in all directions, making it a positive semidefinite matrix in the momentum equation. We assume the Navier-Stokes equations govern the flow in the free flow region, while the Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy's equation governs the flow inside the porous medium. The coupled system contains a nonlinear term from the Brinkman-Forchheimer equation. We propose an approximate solution using an iterative method valid for a wide range of porous media parameter values. For both high and low values of the Darcy number, the asymptotic solutions derived from the regular perturbation method and matched asymptotic expansion show good agreement with the numerical results. However, these methods are not effective in the intermediate range. To address this, we employ the artificial Levenberg-Marquardt method with a back-propagated neural network (ALMM-BNN) paradigm to predict the solution in the intermediate range. While it may not provide the exact solutions, it successfully captures the overall trend and demonstrates good qualitative agreement with the numerical results. This highlights the potential of the ALMM-BNN paradigm as a robust predictive tool in challenging parameter ranges where numerical solutions are either difficult to obtain or computationally expensive. The current model provides valuable insights into the shear stress distribution of arterial blood flow, taking into account the variable viscosity of the blood in the presence of inertial effects. It also offers a framework for creating glycocalyx scaffolding and other microfluidic systems that can mimic the biological glycocalyx.</description>

      <title>Bubble entrainment in turbulent jets leaping from liquid surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of air entrainment in turbulent water jets exiting a pool near the free surface. Our experimental results reveal that bubble entrainment occurs only within a specific region close to the point where the jet exits the water and is dictated solely by the jet's exit velocity, rather than the Reynolds number. The morphology of the jet above the pool surface, influenced predominantly by the Froude number or the injection angle, classifies the flow into two regimes: curtain jet and column jet. However, variations in jet morphology have minimal impact on the critical velocity required for bubble entrainment. Our findings suggest that bubble entrainment is driven by the dynamic interplay of shear forces and instabilities. As the jet exits the nozzle, it interacts with the surrounding fluids, amplifying instabilities through Kelvin-Helmholtz mechanisms. These disturbances generate intense fluctuations on the jet surface, creating localized low-pressure zones that trap air and entrain bubbles. As the jet progresses further into the air, capillary forces dampen surface instabilities, diminishing the jet's capacity to sustain bubble entrainment at longer distances. This study offers new insights into the mechanics of air entrainment in turbulent water jets, emphasizing the role of injection velocity and instabilities in the entrainment process.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation of a gravity-driven glider with adjustable centre-of-mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial gliders are designed to disperse as they settle through a fluid, requiring precise navigation to reach target locations. We show that a compact glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$, the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force, which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the inertial lift force at large Re$_p$.

      <title>Whipped and mixed warm clouds in the deep sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is indispensable to redistribute nutrients for all life forms larger than microbial, on land and in the ocean. Yet, the development of deep-sea turbulence has not been studied in three dimensions (3D). As a disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2500-m deep bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half-cubic hectometer 3D mooring-array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep-sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001degrC, variable convection-turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating, movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial-wave breakdown that commonly occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries.</description>

      <title>Emergence of advection-diffusion transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of strongly driven instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instabilities driven by strong gradients appear in a wide variety of physical systems, including plasmas, neutral fluids, and self-gravitating systems. This work develops an analytic formulation to describe the transport structure and nonlinear amplitude evolution of a discrete, strongly driven instability in the presence of energy sources and sinks. Initially, the mode is found to evolve linearly until the gradient in the distribution has been exhausted. It then transitions to a nonlinear phase governed by a Bernoulli differential equation, for which a closed-form analytic solution is found, and continues to evolve until the energy sources and sinks reach equilibrium. During the nonlinear phase, the leading order distribution function is found to persistently satisfy an advection-diffusion equation in time and energy coordinates. These analytical results are shown to agree closely with nonlinear kinetic simulations and to be readily applicable in the study of resonant transport in plasmas, galaxies and viscous shear flows.</description>

      <title>A predictive model for bubble-particle collisions in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modelling of bubble-particle collisions is crucial to improving the efficiency of industrial processes such as froth flotation. Although such systems usually have turbulent flows and the bubbles are typically much larger than the particles, there currently exist no predictive models for this case which consistently include finite-size effects in the interaction with the bubbles as well as inertial effects for the particles simultaneously. As a first step, Jiang and Krug (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 1006, 2025, A19) proposed a frozen turbulence approach which captures the collision rate between finite-size bubbles and inertial particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using the bubble slip velocity probability density function measured from simulations as an input. In this study, we further develop this approach into a model where the bubble-particle collision rate can be predicted a priori based on the bubble, particle, and turbulence properties. By comparing the predicted collision rate with simulations of bubbles with Stokes numbers of 2.8 and 6.3, and particles with Stokes numbers ranging from 0.01 to 2 in turbulence with a Taylor Reynolds number of 64, good agreement is found between model and simulations for Froude number $Fr \leq 0.25$. Beyond this range of bubble Stokes number, we propose a criterion for using our model and discuss the model's validity. Evaluating our model at typical flotation parameters indicates that particle inertia and settling effects are usually important. Generally, smaller bubbles, larger particles, and stronger turbulence increase the overall collision rate.</description>

      <title>The piston effect in supercritical fluids investigated via a reversible-irreversible vector field splitting-based explicit time integration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.</description>
