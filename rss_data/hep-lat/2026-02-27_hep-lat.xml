      <title>Interplay of Gauss Law and the fermion sign problem in quantum link models with dynamical matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Link Models with dynamical matter coupled to spin-$\frac{1}{2} \ \rm U(1)$ gauge fields in $d=2+1 $ and $3+1$ can potentially give rise to the Coulomb phase expected in quantum electrodynamics (QED) and other confining phases. Using exact diagonalization techniques, we show that the ground state in a class of models without the magnetic field always lies in the sector which satisfies $(G_e,G_o) = (d,\ -d)$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $e$ and $o$ are even and odd sites. It can be analytically proven that this sector is free of the fermion sign problem. We also demonstrate that a meron cluster algorithm for the problem naturally samples the ground states of the Hamiltonian in the aforementioned Gauss Law sector.</description>

      <title>The hadronic tensor from four-point functions on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hadronic tensor is the central non-perturbative object in the calculation of the cross section of lepton-hadron interactions like neutrino-nucleon scattering. It is usually parameterized in terms of structure functions, which encode all necessary information for all kinematic regions. Moreover, the structure functions can be factorized in terms of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and contains information on hadron resonances. On the lattice, we can calculate the corresponding matrix element of two quark-bilinear currents with a relative Euclidean time separation. The reconstruction of the hadronic tensor in Minkowski space requires appropriate dealing with the corresponding inverse problem. In our current work, we extend previous calculations on the nucleon by considering a much larger range of momentum transfers, which is inevitable in the context of structure functions. This can be achieved by using stochastic sources, which allows us to calculate the required four-point functions in a broad kinematic region. We employ a clover fermion ensemble at pion mass $m_\pi = 223~\mathrm{MeV}$ and lattice spacing $a=0.085~\mathrm{fm}$. In these proceedings, we will give an overview of our simulation and present some first preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Confined and Deconfined Phases of Qubit Regularized Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct simple qubit-regularized Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories formulated in the monomer--dimer--tensor-network (MDTN) basis that are free of sign problems in the pure gauge sector. These models naturally realize both confined and deconfined phases. Using classical Monte Carlo methods, we investigate the associated finite-temperature phase transitions and show that they exhibit the expected universality classes of conventional SU(N) lattice gauge theories in various spacetime dimensions. Furthermore, we argue that second-order quantum phase transitions separating the confined and deconfined phases are likely to exist. Such critical points would provide a nonperturbative route to defining continuum limits of qubit-regularized gauge theories, potentially allowing Yang--Mills theory and related continuum gauge theories to emerge from finite-dimensional lattice constructions.</description>

      <title>Generalization of lattice Dirac operator index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive lattice formulation of various types of the Dirac operator indices, employing $K$-theory to classify the Wilson Dirac operator via its spectral flow. In contrast to the index of the overlap Dirac operator defined through the Ginsparg-Wilson relation, which is restricted to flat tori in even dimensions, our formulation offers several key advantages: 1) It can be applied straightforwardly to the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index for manifolds with boundary. 2) The boundary can be curved, allowing for the inclusion of gravitational background effects. 3) The mod-2 index in both even and odd dimensions can be defined as a natural extension of the same formulation. In this talk, we present the mathematical proof and provide numerical evidence supporting the formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a characteristic property of all quantum systems, entanglement participates in many important quantum phenomena. In this proceeding, we employ it in the study of quantum field theories at finite density. We incorporate evaluations of entanglement entropy using the replica trick into MC simulations of $O(N)$ models at finite density with the worm algorithm and present some initial results for the nonlinear $O(4)$ model in 3 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Confinement transition to gravitational waves in the one-flavor $SU(4)$ Hyper Stealth Dark Matter theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of the $SU(4)$ gauge theory with a single flavor of fundamental quarks is analyzed on the lattice with dynamical fermion simulations, which is the low-energy sector of a realistic, strongly-interacting dark matter model -- the Hyper Stealth Dark Matter. The gravitational wave spectrum from the first-order confinement transition in the early universe is further calculated, where the effect of the dark sea quarks, which decrease the interface tension in the effective potential of the Polyakov loop, is shown numerically to lower the gravitational wave amplitude.</description>

      <title>Form factors of the $\rho$ meson from effective field theory and the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of resonance form factors in effective field theory as well as on the lattice is a highly challenging task. In a recent paper, we proposed a novel method based on the introduction of a background field and the Feynman-Hellmann theorem to address the problem, and applied it to a toy model. In the present work we use this method for the electromagnetic form factors of the $\rho$-meson. By matching the results to Chiral Perturbation Theory, we provide a first, crude estimate of all three form factors of the $\rho$-meson within the effective field theory. Contact contributions to these form factors turn out to be substantial. A procedure for lattice calculations is outlined, paving the way for an ab initio approach to the problem.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative renormalization of the energy momentum tensor in the 2d O(3) nonlinear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional O(3) nonlinear sigma model is a well known toy model for studying non-perturbative phenomena in quantum field theory. A central challenge is the renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor, which is complicated by the nonlinear realization of the $O(3)$ symmetry leading to non-trivial operator mixing patterns, and by large discretization artifacts affecting the determination of renormalization constants. We present results for the renormalization constants in the non-singlet sector, employing a modified lattice action with shifted boundary conditions and defining the renormalized coupling through the gradient flow. While we obtain a precise determination of the relative mixing constant $z_T$, the overall normalization $Z_T$ remains inaccessible due to large discretization artifacts. We discuss the origins of these difficulties and outline possible paths forward.</description>

      <title>Spatially inhomogeneous confinement-deconfinement phase transition in rotating QGP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles numerical simulations, we find a new spatially inhomogeneous phase in a rotating gluon plasma. This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal finite-volume effects in the vicinity of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceeding, we discuss the finite-size scaling analysis of the order parameter related to the chiral phase transition in QCD with two massless quarks. We use data obtained in lattice QCD calculations performed with highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ) for a range of light quark masses, $1/240 \leq m_\ell/m_s \leq 1/27$ for different spatial volumes ($N_\sigma$) on Euclidean lattices with temporal extent $N_\tau=8$, satisfying $3\,N_\tau \leq N_\sigma \leq 10\,N_\tau$. We observe that infinite volume extrapolated data for the order parameter agree reasonably well with the expected $O(2)$ scaling behavior even for physical ratios of the light-to-strange quark mass ratio. We quantify deviations from asymptotic scaling and perform a detailed analysis of the influence of finite-size effects in terms of temperature and quark masses at a fixed lattice cutoff. This is crucial for improving the reliability of the infinite-volume extrapolated estimate of the chiral order parameter and for a more precise determination of chiral phase transition temperature from direct Lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation via Multicriticality in a 3D Lattice Gross-Neveu Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.</description>

      <title>Scaling and Luescher Term in a non-Abelian (2+1)d SU$(2)$ Quantum Link Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a non-Abelian SU$(2)$ quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions on a hexagonal lattice using tensor network methods. We determine the static quark potential for a wide range of bare coupling values and find that the theory is confining. We also probe the existence of a Luescher term and find a clear signal, however, the value of the dimensionless constant $\gamma$ strongly deviates from the expected universal value $-\pi/24$ for almost all values of the coupling $g^2$ we investigated. The width of the strings scales logarithmically with the string length again for all $g^2$-values, providing evidence for a rough string, with no indication for a roughening transition.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, lattice QCD calculations of hadron spectroscopy have concentrated on resonances and shallow bound states detected via poles in two- and three-hadron scattering amplitudes. Hadron interactions have therefore become a key focus. In these proceedings, I review the current state of the art and recent advances in methods for studying hadron interactions via finite-volume spectroscopy and finite-volume quantization conditions. I will also review recent spectroscopy studies and results presented at Lattice 2025, with a focus on charmed mesons, the doubly charmed tetraquark, and the doubly bottom tetraquark.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models for arbitrary number of flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of fermionic quantum field theories is an important problem for realizing the standard model of particle physics on a quantum computer. As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class. Our work is a concrete step towards the quantum simulation of real-time dynamics of large $N_f$ fermionic quantum field theories models relevant for chiral symmetry breaking, understanding dimensional transmutation, and exploring the conformal window of field theories on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation for Hard Partons in a Gluonic Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a fluctuation dissipation relation connecting the drag and diffusion jet transport coefficients for an energetic light quark traversing a non-perturbative thermalized gluon plasma. The hard quark is taken to be close to on-shell, with an energy scale parametrically larger than the medium temperature. We introduce a general complex-valued function for each transport coefficient. Evaluating these in the deep Euclidean momentum region enables their expression in terms of local operators. Using contour-integration techniques, we relate these local operators, after vacuum subtraction, to the physical transport coefficients that arise along a branch cut, close to light-like dispersion. The derived relation relates the longitudinal drag coefficient to the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients, a $4^{\rm th}$ order fluctuation, and the thermal gluon condensate.</description>

      <title>Bottom-charmed meson states in inverse problem of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the bottom-charmed ($B_c$) meson spectrum within the inverse matrix QCD sum rules formalism. In this framework, conventional QCD sum rules are recast as an inverse problem, allowing for the direct reconstruction of hadronic spectral densities from first principles without invoking phenomenological continuum parametrizations or quark-hadron duality assumptions. We compute the masses and decay constants of conventional $B_c$ mesons with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-$, $1^-$, $0^+$, and $1^+$. The obtained results are in close agreement with available experimental measurements and are consistent with predictions from various theoretical and phenomenological approaches. The inverse matrix formulation exhibits improved numerical stability and reduced systematic uncertainties relative to standard implementations, highlighting its suitability for precision spectroscopy of heavy quarkonium systems.</description>

Abstract: Confinement and string breaking are two fundamental phenomena in gauge theories. Signatures of both are currently pursued in quantum-simulator experiments, opening a new angle on strongly interacting dynamics of gauge fields out of equilibrium, complementary to traditional particle-physics settings. In this work, we report the emergence of metastable confinement dynamics in a U(1) lattice gauge theory, originating from the competition between string tension and four-Fermi coupling - a competition that naturally arises in Rydberg atom arrays. We show that the initial string state can be resonantly melted through controlled energy matching, a phenomenon we identify as resonant string breaking. We demonstrate this mechanism for both static and Floquet-driven systems, where periodic modulation generates a spectrum of tunable sideband resonances. Our work provides new insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking driven by long-range interactions and time-dependent fields, which are available in current quantum simulators on a variety of platforms.</description>
