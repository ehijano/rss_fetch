      <title>Intercity Connectivity and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban outputs, from economy to innovation, are known to grow as a power of a city's population. But, since large cities tend to be central in transportation and communication networks, the effects attributed to city size may be confounded with those of intercity connectivity. Here, we map intercity networks for the world's two largest economies (the United States and China) to explore whether a city's position in the networks of communication, human mobility, and scientific collaboration explains variance in a city's patenting activity that is unaccounted for by its population. We find evidence that models incorporating intercity connectivity outperform population-based models and exhibit stronger predictive power for patenting activity, particularly for technologies of more recent vintage (which we expect to be more complex or sophisticated). The effects of intercity connectivity are more robust in China, even after controlling for population, GDP, and education, but not in the United States once adjusted for GDP and education. This divergence suggests distinct urban network dynamics driving innovation in these regions. In China, models with social media and mobility networks explain more heterogeneity in the scaling of innovation, whereas in the United States, scientific collaboration plays a more significant role. These findings support the significance of a city's position within the intercity network in shaping its success in innovative activities.</description>

      <title>A Review of Spatial Network Insights and Methods in the Context of Planning: Applications, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of geospatial big data, new narratives of cities based on spatial networks and flows have replaced the traditional focus on locations. While plenty of research have empirically analyzed network structures, there lacks a state-of-the-art synthesis of applicable insights and methods of spatial networks in the planning context. In this chapter, we reviewed the theories, concepts, methods, and applications of spatial network analysis in cities and their insights for planners from four areas of concern: spatial structures, urban infrastructure optimizations, indications of economic wealth, social capital, and residential mobility, and public health control (especially COVID-19). We also outlined four challenges that planners face when taking the planning knowledge from spatial networks to actions: data openness and privacy, linkage to direct policy implications, lack of civic engagement, and the difficulty to visualize and integrate with GIS. Finally, we envisioned how spatial networks can be integrated into a collaborative planning framework.</description>

      <title>Cooperative bots exhibit nuanced effects on cooperation across strategic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The positive impact of cooperative bots on cooperation within evolutionary game theory is well documented; however, existing studies have predominantly used discrete strategic frameworks, focusing on deterministic actions with a fixed probability of one. This paper extends the investigation to continuous and mixed strategic approaches. Continuous strategies employ intermediate probabilities to convey varying degrees of cooperation and focus on expected payoffs. In contrast, mixed strategies calculate immediate payoffs from actions chosen at a given moment within these probabilities. Using the prisoner's dilemma game, this study examines the effects of cooperative bots on human cooperation within hybrid populations of human players and simple bots, across both well-mixed and structured populations. Our findings reveal that cooperative bots significantly enhance cooperation in both population types across these strategic approaches under weak imitation scenarios, where players are less concerned with material gains. However, under strong imitation scenarios, while cooperative bots do not alter the defective equilibrium in well-mixed populations, they have varied impacts in structured populations across these strategic approaches. Specifically, they disrupt cooperation under discrete and continuous strategies but facilitate it under mixed strategies. These results highlight the nuanced effects of cooperative bots within different strategic frameworks and underscore the need for careful deployment, as their effectiveness is highly sensitive to how humans update their actions and their chosen strategic approach.</description>

      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition of k-frequent destinations network for urban mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban spatial interactions are a complex aggregation of routine visits and random explorations by individuals. The inherent uncertainty of these random visitations poses significant challenges to understanding urban structures and socioeconomic developments. To capture the core dynamics of urban interaction networks, we analyze the percolation structure of the $k$-most frequented destinations of intracity place-to-place flows from mobile phone data of eight major U.S. cities at a Census Block Group (CBG) level. Our study reveals a consistent percolation transition at $k^* = 130$, a critical threshold for the number of frequently visited destinations necessary to maintain a cohesive urban network. This percolation threshold proves remarkably consistent across diverse urban configurations, sizes, and geographical settings over a 48-month study period, and can largely be interpreted as the joint effect of the emergence of hubness and the level of mixing of residents. Furthermore, we examine the socioeconomic profiles of residents from different origin areas categorized by the fulfillment level of $k^*=130$ principal destinations, revealing a pronounced distinction in the origins' socioeconomic advantages. These insights offer a nuanced understanding of how urban spaces are interconnected and the determinants of travel behavior. Our findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the structural dynamics that govern urban spatial interactions.</description>

      <title>Talking the Talk Does Not Entail Walking the Walk: On the Limits of Large Language Models in Lexical Entailment Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verbs form the backbone of language, providing the structure and meaning to sentences. Yet, their intricate semantic nuances pose a longstanding challenge. Understanding verb relations through the concept of lexical entailment is crucial for comprehending sentence meanings and grasping verb dynamics. This work investigates the capabilities of eight Large Language Models in recognizing lexical entailment relations among verbs through differently devised prompting strategies and zero-/few-shot settings over verb pairs from two lexical databases, namely WordNet and HyperLex. Our findings unveil that the models can tackle the lexical entailment recognition task with moderately good performance, although at varying degree of effectiveness and under different conditions. Also, utilizing few-shot prompting can enhance the models' performance. However, perfectly solving the task arises as an unmet challenge for all examined LLMs, which raises an emergence for further research developments on this topic.</description>

      <title>A Highly Granular Temporary Migration Dataset Derived From Mobile Phone Data in Senegal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding temporary migration is crucial for addressing various socio-economic and environmental challenges in developing countries. However, traditional surveys often fail to capture such movements effectively, leading to a scarcity of reliable data, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This article introduces a detailed and open-access dataset that leverages mobile phone data to capture temporary migration in Senegal with unprecedented spatio-temporal detail. The dataset provides measures of migration flows and stock across 151 locations across the country and for each half-month period from 2013 to 2015, with a specific focus on movements lasting between 20 and 180 days. The article presents a suite of methodological tools that not only include algorithmic methods for the detection of temporary migration events in digital traces, but also addresses key challenges in aggregating individual trajectories into coherent migration statistics. These methodological advancements are not only pivotal for the intrinsic value of the dataset but also adaptable for generating systematic migration statistics from other digital trace datasets in other contexts.</description>

      <title>The disruption index suffers from citation inflation and is confounded by shifts in scholarly citation practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the rate of innovation in academia and industry is fundamental to monitoring the efficiency and competitiveness of the knowledge economy. To this end, a disruption index (CD) was recently developed and applied to publication and patent citation networks (Wu et al., Nature 2019; Park et al., Nature 2023). Here we show that CD systematically decreases over time due to secular growth in research and patent production, following two distinct mechanisms unrelated to innovation -- one behavioral and the other structural. Whereas the behavioral explanation reflects shifts associated with techno-social factors (e.g. self-citation practices), the structural explanation follows from `citation inflation' (CI), an inextricable feature of real citation networks attributable to increasing reference list lengths, which causes CD to systematically decrease. We demonstrate this causal link by way of mathematical deduction, computational simulation, multi-variate regression, and quasi-experimental comparison of the disruptiveness of PNAS versus PNAS Plus articles, which differ only in their lengths. Accordingly, we analyze CD data available in the SciSciNet database and find that disruptiveness incrementally increased from 2005-2015, and that the negative relationship between disruption and team-size is remarkably small in overall magnitude effect size, and shifts from negative to positive for team size $\geq$ 8 coauthors.</description>

      <title>A new understanding on the history of developing MRI for cancer detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Science is about facts and truth. Yet sometimes the truth and facts are not obvious. For example, in the field of MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), there has been a long-lasting debate about who were the major contributors in its development. Particularly, there was a strong dispute between the followers of two scientists, R. Damadian and P. Lauterbur. In this review, we carefully trace the major developments in applying NMR for cancer detection starting almost 50 years ago. The research records show that the truth was beyond the claims of either research camps. The development of NMR for cancer detection involved multiple research groups, who made critical contributions at different junctures.</description>

Abstract: Forecasting, to estimate future events, is crucial for business and decision-making. This paper proposes QxEAI, a methodology that produces a probabilistic forecast that utilizes a quantum-like evolutionary algorithm based on training a quantum-like logic decision tree and a classical value tree on a small number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of our quantum-like evolutionary algorithm to forecasting can overcome the challenges faced by classical and other machine learning approaches. By using three real-world datasets (Dow Jones Index, retail sales, gas consumption), we show how our methodology produces accurate forecasts while requiring little to none manual work.</description>

      <title>ESND: An Embedding-based Framework for Signed Network Dismantling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network dismantling aims to maximize the disintegration of a network by removing a specific set of nodes or edges and is applied to various tasks in diverse domains, such as cracking down on crime organizations, delaying the propagation of rumors, and blocking the transmission of viruses. Most of the current network dismantling methods are tailored for unsigned networks, which only consider the connection between nodes without evaluating the nature of the relationships, such as friendship/hostility, enhancing/repressing, and trust/distrust. We here propose an embedding-based algorithm, namely ESND, to solve the signed network dismantling problem. The algorithm generally iterates the following four steps, i.e., giant component detection, network embedding, node clustering, and removal node selection. To illustrate the efficacy and stability of ESND, we conduct extensive experiments on six signed network datasets as well as null models, and compare the performance of our method with baselines. Experimental results consistently show that the proposed ESND is superior to the baselines and displays stable performance with the change in the network structure. Additionally, we examine the impact of sign proportions on network robustness via ESND, observing that networks with a high ratio of negative edges are generally easier to dismantle than networks with high positive edges.</description>
