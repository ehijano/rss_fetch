      <title>Interfacial Coupling Controls Molecular Epitaxy of HMTP on Graphene/SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth critically influences structural and electronic properties of organic semiconductors. Graphene serves as a prominent van der Waals template for molecular self-assembly; however, graphene on SiC is intrinsically heterogeneous, with decoupled monolayer graphene coexisting with residuals of a covalently bound buffer layer, which may affect molecular ordering. Here, we track the ordering of the molecular donor, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamethoxytriphenylene (HMTP), from the first layer to thin films, combining low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction with X-ray diffraction. HMTP forms highly ordered epitaxial layers on single-layer graphene, whereas growth on the buffer layer initiates as amorphous and evolves into polycrystalline films with weak orientation with respect to the substrate. Crucially, hydrogen intercalation decouples the buffer layer, converting it into quasi-freestanding monolayer graphene and restoring epitaxial growth. These findings demonstrate that interfacial coupling governs molecular epitaxy on graphene/SiC, and interface engineering via hydrogen intercalation provides a scalable route to control organic thin-film crystallinity on graphene.</description>

      <title>Analysis of some solid amorphous inorganic structures and the boson peak phenomenon with a computational random graph approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a new alternative model algorithm has been proposed for assembling amorphous structures, unifying the bosonic paradigm applicable at low temperatures with crystalline models relevant at room and higher temperatures. Physical meaning of main model parameters is determined together with an explanation for the appearing bosonic peak using the random graph theory. Numerically, statistical atomic distribution in a multiphase amorphous system is provided without the melting simulation of base crystals, and the mean energy function has been determined analytically. The calculated table data are in good agreement with neutronography measurements of the actual amorphous alloy in its solid state. Programme optimisations were also implemented, and we outlined several effective steps to achieve the higher processing speed. The proposed programme code can be used for potential test assembling and simulations of amorphous systems with sorting by the optimal atomic content or proportion (i.e. glass forming ability).</description>

      <title>Chirality and Clock transitions in Twisted Dipolar Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study samples and a dipolar model of magnetic rods arranged on twisted polygonal clusters in terms of the twist angle. We find that the relative twist between polygons induces noncollinear chiral phases, ranging from flux vortex closure to hedgehog like radial configurations. Chirality, quantified in terms of a bond order parameter, is an emergent property that behaves here as an Ising variable. The chiral configurations of the systems can be understood in terms of chirality and clock index order parameters, whose evolution with twist occurs through two types of first order phase transitions. Within a fixed Ising chiral sector, the clock index, rooted in the $C_N$ invariance of the polygons, characterizes chiral textures that share chirality. As the twist increases, it continuously shifts the preferred relative clock phase, but the Nfold anisotropy only allows discrete orientations; the competition produces a tilted Nfold energy landscape whose global minimum hops discontinuously between clock sectors. As the number of sites in the polygon grows, the resulting response displays a nonlinear crossover from rigid, Ising like behavior to an almost $\rm U(1)$ invariant regime, governed by a twist induced suppression of the emergent $Z_N$ clock anisotropy. A Landau phenomenology captures these trends and naturally extends to bilayer lattices, where we show that twisted honeycomb systems realize an effective sine-Gordon theory with twist-controlled transitions between isolated domain walls and domain wall lattices.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen in Brownmillerite Perovskites: First-Principles Insights into Energetics and Induced Electronic-Magnetic Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen uptake in brownmillerite perovskites A2B2O5 offers an (electro)chemically accessible route to tune functional properties, but mechanistic understanding and design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides remain limited. Here we employ density functional theory (DFT) to quantify how H absorption affects electronic structure, magnetic exchange, and anisotropy in representative Sr2Fe2O5 and Sr2Co2O5 oxides. We find that hydrogenation introduces a localized electron that stabilizes near the proton, with B-site-dependent preference. The resulting lattice distortions and redistribution of charge density modify exchange coupling and cant the Neel vector, giving rise to weak ferromagnetism. We also show that absorption energies are highly sensitive to proton-electron arrangements and magnetic order, varying by up to 1 eV across different settings. This sensitivity demands consistent treatment of charge localization and spin states, together with careful choice of computational parameters. Extending to a variety of experimentally reported A2B2O5 compositions, we identify candidates with favorable H uptake and uncover a trend linking more favorable absorption to a higher B-site d-electron count. We also demonstrate that the preferred proton absorption site in these materials is governed by local O-O separations and lattice flexibility, which describe the ability of the framework to accommodate proton-induced distortions. Finally, benchmarks of universal machine-learning interatomic potentials reveal uncertainties of about 1 eV for site-resolved absorption energies, motivating descriptor-based surrogate models and targeted DFT validation. Together, these results establish practical design rules for hydrogen-responsive oxides relevant to iono-electronic devices, sensors, and electrically tunable spin functionality.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale mapping of phase-transformation pathways in medium-Mn TRIP steel by multimodal STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical response of third-generation advanced high-strength steels is governed by phase transformations at the nanoscale, yet the coupled evolution of chemistry and crystallography remains poorly resolved. Here we apply a correlative scanning transmission electron microscopy approach that enables simultaneous mapping of lattice structure, crystallographic orientation, and phase distribution at 10 nanometre resolution in a medium-manganese TRIP steel. We combine nano-beam electron diffraction and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps to characterize an industrial medium-manganese steel containing 7.15 weight percent Mn. Tensile testing of a rolled steel sample was performed, and lamellae were extracted from deformed and undeformed regions. Manganese-resolved energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy provides a chemical fingerprint that, when combined with nano-beam electron diffraction based phase segmentation, enables robust ferrite-martensite separation and phase-resolved lattice-parameter refinement. The phase fractions of ferrite, austenite, and martensite are quantified together with their corresponding lattice parameters, accompanied by measurable shifts in grain-size distributions and crystallographic texture in the deformed regions. Kernel average misorientation maps reveal systematically lower local misorientation in ferrite than in martensite. This multimodal workflow provides a transferable framework for quantitative, phase-resolved analysis of complex multiphase alloys at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Monolayer Ice on a Hydrophobic Metal Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding water-metal interactions is central to disciplines spanning catalysis, electrochemistry, and atmospheric science. Monolayer ice phases are well established on hydrophilic surfaces, where strong water-substrate interactions stabilize ordered hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, their formation on hydrophobic metals has been deemed ther-modynamically unfavourable, with water typically assembling into amorphous films, three-dimensional crystallites, or interlocked bilayer ice. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a monolayer ice phase on the hydrophobic Au(111) surface using a low-energy-electron-assisted growth method. Combined experimental characterizations including low-energy electron diffraction, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, complemented by first-principles calculations, prove that the monolayer ice phase composes of intact water molecules. This approach provides a generalizable strategy for stabilizing ordered two-dimensional ice on inert substrates and offers new insight into the interplay between water and low-energy electrons at hydrophobic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Microstructural Simulations of Photonic Sintering of Oxide Ceramics: A Two-Scale Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic sintering (PS) offers an ultra-fast, contact-free alternative to conventional sintering and has demonstrated its potential for enhancing the sinterability of acceptor-doped barium zirconate (BZY) ceramics. However, a central challenge in the PS process lies in achieving precise control over thermal self-stabilization in the presence of complex microstructural effects arising from photonic-ray--induced thermal profiles. To elucidate the interplay among thermal fields, microstructural evolution, and PS process parameters, this study establishes a two-scale, non-isothermal simulation framework. The framework integrates macroscopic heat-transfer simulations, incorporating effective heat conduction and photonic-ray--induced volumetric heating in the porous media, with microscopic non-isothermal phase-field sintering simulations that resolve microstructure evolution under local thermal profile. Scale bridging is achieved through a temperature field transferring and mapping that satisfies Hill-Mandel condition between the macroscopic and microscopic simulations, while maintaining synchronization between their asynchronous time-stepping schemes. After calibrating model parameters against experimental measurements, the framework successfully reproduces the experimentally observed porosity inhomogeneity along the sample depth. The influence of enhanced localized mass transport is further examined through a parametric investigation of surface and grain boundary diffusivities. Overall, the proposed framework demonstrates its feasibility and physical interpretability in establishing process-microstructure relationships for the scalable fabrication of high-performance protonic ceramics.</description>

      <title>Turning Insulators into Accelerators: Deciphering the Interfacial Conductivity Boost in ZrO2-Li2ZrCl6 Composites through Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide solid-state electrolytes have emerged as promising candidates for all-solid-state lithium batteries due to their high oxidative stability and deformability, yet their moderate ionic conductivity remains a bottleneck. While incorporating ionically insulating ZrO2 nanoparticles (Nat. Commun. 2023, 14, 2459) has been experimentally shown to enhance the ionic conductivity of Li2ZrCl6, the atomistic origin governing this interfacial phenomenon remains unclear. Here, we bridge the spatiotemporal gap in modeling complex heterostructures by developing an accurate machine-learned force fields based on neuroevolution potential, enabling large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 heterostructures. By systematically investigating four representative low-lattice-mismatch ZrO2/Li2ZrCl6 interfaces, we identify spontaneous interfacial amorphization driven by space-charge effects upon surface cleavage, trapping Li+ and leading to under-coordinated Li+ polyhedrons with pronounced geometric distortion. These distorted amorphous interfacial regions exhibit markedly enhanced Li+ hopping activity, significantly outperforming the bulk lattice, provided that local mobile Li+ inventory is not depleted by surface charge redistribution. This work establishes a computational framework for training validated machine-learned force fields for interfaces and provides mechanistic understandings of the interfacial conductivity boost in the insulator-conductor composites, guiding the rational design of electrolytes toward next-generation solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Gibbs free energy into interatomic potential fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to fit high-temperature Gibbs free energy data for the development of interatomic potentials for atomic systems. The approach is based on Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration, enabling the identification of suitable potential parameters such that the system's free energy matches a specified target. The method can be readily combined with conventional fitting techniques for properties such as elastic tensors and liquid pair distribution functions. We validate the effectiveness of the approach using the Uhlenbeck-Ford model and embedded-atom method potentials for pure Ni phases and binary Fe1-xOx liquids under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. Our framework provides an efficient strategy for incorporating free energy into interatomic potential fitting.</description>

      <title>Optimizing spin-based terahertz emission from magnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz radiation pulses can be generated efficiently through femtosecond laser excitation of a ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic heterostructure, wherein an ultrafast laser-induced spin current results in an electromagnetic THz pulse due to spin-charge conversion. It is, however, still poorly understood how the THz emission amplitude and its bandwidth can be optimized. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the THz emission from various magnetic heterostructures. The dynamics of the spin current is described by the semiclassical, superdiffusive spin-transport model and the energy dependence of the spin Hall effect of hot electrons is taken into account, leading to emission profiles for Co(2 nm)/Pt(4 nm) bilayer in good agreement with experiment. To identify the optimal {conditions} for THz emission, {we study} the properties of the emitted THz wave profile by systematically varying the layer thicknesses of metallic bilayers, their interfacial spin-current transmission properties, their materials' dependence, and influence of the pump laser-pulse width, allowing us to give optimization guidelines. We find that thin nonmagnetic layer thicknesses of 5-6 nm provide the largest bandwidth in the case of Co/Pt and that the peak frequency of the THz emission depends only on the geometry of the emitter and not on the laser pulse width. The THz bandwidth {is conversely found to} depend on several factors such as exciting laser pulse width, layers' thicknesses, and interface transmission-reflection properties, with the limitation that an increase in the bandwidth by tuning the interface properties comes with a trade-off in the energy efficiency of the emitter. Lastly, we propose a double pulse excitation protocol of a trilayer system that could provide broadband THz emission with a large bandwidth. {Our results contribute to establishing guidelines for optimizing spintronic THz generation.</description>

      <title>Long-distance spin transport in frustrated hyperkagome magnet Gd3Ga5O12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport of spin angular momentum over large distance has been a long sought-after goal in the field of spintronics. While the majority of the research effort has been devoted to the spin transport properties of magnetically ordered materials, spin transport in magnetically frustrated materials has received little attention. Here, we report an anomalous state in frustrated hyperkagome magnetic insulator Gd3Ga5O12, where spin angular momenta can be transported over a long distance of 480 {\mu}m, far exceeding the transport distance of any diffusive spin current in magnetically ordered materials, to the best of our knowledge. Monte Carlo simulations reveal significant spin fluctuations, spin-spin correlations and an absence of conventional magnons in such anomalous state; while the response of the anomalous state to perturbation is found to be akin to an overdamped forced oscillator. We find close relation of such state to the correlated ``director'' state in the material. Our result provides an effective electrical technique to characterize spin-spin correlations and frustrations; it also unveils the potential of frustrated magnets as powerful channel materials for spin transport.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric switching at edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ modelled at the atomic scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric switching governs the functional properties of ferroelectric perovskites. It is widely accepted that this switching depends on domain nucleation and pinning and that these processes can be controlled by the defect structure. However, an atomistic picture of the influence of one important class of defects - dislocations on ferroelectric switching is missing. This is an important gap in knowledge as dislocations cannot be avoided at interfaces and can also be engineered by plastic deformation at high temperatures. Using atomistic simulations, we show how the cores of $\langle100\rangle$ edge dislocations in BaTiO$_3$ can either act as nucleation centers for ferroelectric switching or pin walls depending on the direction of the applied field. The coupling between electric field and polarization is strongest when the field is applied parallel to the Burgers vector of the dislocation.</description>

      <title>Magnetization reversal and anisotropies in buffered transition-metal alloys thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in planar Hall effect (PHE) sensors has re-emerged in recent years due to their promising potential for a wide range of applications, particularly in biotechnology. Sensor sensitivity can be enhanced by lowering the effective anisotropy field; however, this favors magnetic domain formation during magnetization reversal, leading to hysteretic responses. Therefore, precise control of magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal is essential to balance sensitivity and stability in PHE sensors. In this work, we investigate the magnetic anisotropy and magnetization reversal mechanisms of Ni-Fe- and Co-Fe-based multilayers grown on various metallic buffer layers and deposited with and without an external magnetic field, in order to evaluate the effects of the buffer layers and field-assisted deposition on the resulting magnetic anisotropy. NiFe films exhibit a dominant uniaxial anisotropy mainly determined by the applied field during growth, with an anisotropy constant of approximately $3,\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$, largely independent of the buffer layer. In contrast, the magnetic anisotropy of CoFe films is dominated by the buffer layer, resulting in a biaxial magnetic response. In particular, Ag-buffered films deposited under an external magnetic field exhibit a biaxial anisotropy with values up to $14.88,\mathrm{kerg,cm^{-3}}$. The magnetization reversal mechanism of each system was deduced from the analysis of the angular dependence of the coercive field.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the classic N\'eel diagram for ferrimagnets within a mean-field framework and reveal a critical point at which full magnetic compensation is maintained below the Curie temperature and extends past the nominal compensation point. Ferrimagnets tuned to this critical point display altermagnetic-like features and markedly enhanced coercive fields. We show that proximity to this regime requires minimizing the net local moment while balancing exchange interactions with respect to the number of equivalent atoms in each sublattice. The resulting extended N\'eel diagram provides practical design principles for engineering ferrimagnets near the critical point via targeted chemical substitution that combines atoms with robust and weak local moments, as demonstrated through density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations for GdCo$_5$-type ferrimagnets.</description>

      <title>Resolving Structural Avalanches in Amorphous Carbon with Arclength Continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic deformation in amorphous solids is carried by localized shear transformations that self-organize into avalanches. In amorphous carbon modeled with a machine-learned interatomic potential, we find that the energetics and organization of these avalanches can be resolved by systematically following the underlying energy landscape. With a pseudo-arclength numerical continuation framework, we decompose avalanches into constituent shear transformations and determine their strain-dependent energetics. Our analysis shows that, prior to onset, avalanches have a latent structure that consists of well-separated local minima. We further demonstrate that arclength continuation yields an event driven framework for following avalanche dynamics, eliminating time-step effects on statistical avalanche properties such as distributions of stress drops.</description>

      <title>Role of quasi-Fermi levels in Si- and Mg-related optical absorption in nitride laser diodes (LDs): material context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical absorption and reabsorption of light emitted from active regions in nitride laser diodes (LDs) have been shown to reduce the light extraction efficiency of these devices. It was proven that the presence of Si and Mg may considerably increase the optical absorption. This effect is much stronger in the high-energy (short-wavelength) range of the spectrum. The absorption increase is directly related to the ionization of the Si donor and Mg acceptor levels, which are controlled by the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. It is shown that the absorption may be increased because of the higher ionization of Mg caused by the compensation in the p-type region and the high ionization of Si in the n-type region. It was explained theoretically why optical efficiency is increased by removal of doping in waveguides. It was also shown that good material quality leads to a low absorption level, especially in the Mg-doped p-type part of the device.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen at GaN(0001) surface control of Fermi level pinning: Mg activation of p-type conductivity -- Nakamura process deciphered</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations were used to disentangle the mystery of Nakamura activation of p-type in Mg doped MOVPE grown gallium nitride, the key process leading to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics. Calculations were used to obtain the equilibrium state of the hydrogen atom deep in the GaN bulk and at the GaN(0001) surface. It was shown that the H position within bulk GaN depends on the Fermi level: in n-type GaN, it is located in the channel, whereas in p-type GaN, it is attached to the N atom, breaking one of the GaN bonds. In contrast, at the GaN(0001) surface, H is attached in the on-top position for any hydrogen coverage; for low and high H-coverage, the Fermi level is pinned at the Ga - broken bond state and at the valence band maximum (VBM), respectively. The diffusion path from the bulk to the surface was obtained when the Fermi level was high and low, the barrier was zero, and $\Delta E_{bar} \approx 1.717 eV$, which effectively blocked hydrogen escape into the vapor. Thus, high H coverage, that is, high hydrogen pressure in the vapor, prevents H from escaping from the bulk to the surface, whereas at low coverage (low hydrogen pressure), the process is barrierless. It is therefore proven that the hydrogen escape control step in the Nakamura process is the transition of hydrogen from the bulk to the surface, which is controlled by the position of the Fermi level at the surface. Molecular hydrogen desorption from the surface is easy for high H coverage and difficult for low, thus opposite to observed experimentally thus this process is not the determining step in activation. A full thermodynamic estimate of the maximal partial pressure of hydrogen in the vapor, corresponding to the transition of the Fermi level from the Ga-broken bond state to the VBM, was used to establish the maximal hydrogen pressure limit for the p-type Mg activation process.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Power of Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory to Explore the Electronic Structure Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray free-electron laser diagnostics have enabled direct probing of the electronic structure under extreme pressures and temperatures, such as those encountered in stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion experiments, challenging theoretical models for interpreting experimental data. Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KSDFT) has been successfully applied to analyze experimental X-ray scattering measurements, but its high computational cost renders routine application impractical. Orbital-free DFT (OFDFT) is a substantially more efficient alternative, with computational cost scaling linearly with system size and a weak temperature dependence, yet it often lacks the accuracy required for electronic structure description. Overcoming this limitation, we present a non-empirical Kohn-Sham-assisted orbital-free density functional framework for calculations at extreme conditions, which enables efficient OFDFT simulations with KSDFT-level accuracy for electron densities, electron-ion structure factors, and equations of state across a broad range of conditions. Benchmark comparisons with quantum Monte Carlo data for dense hydrogen and validation against Rayleigh weight measurements of hot dense beryllium demonstrate the reliability of the framework and speedups of up to several hundred times compared with KSDFT. We further show that even at temperatures on the order of 100 eV, quantum non-locality remains essential for correctly describing the electronic structure of dense hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale Imaging of Iodide-Gold Interactions in Nanoconfined Liquid-Solid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionalization of nanoporous metallic materials enables the tailoring of surface chemistry and morphology in nanostructured materials, optimising their performance for electrocatalytic and sensor applications. Liquid phase chemical functionalization is governed by liquid solid interfaces. Yet, these interfaces remain poorly understood due to the challenges of characterising the liquid phase at high spatial and chemical resolutions. To elucidate pathways for functionalizing nanoscale metals, it is crucial to measure the distribution of species, including light elements, across the liquid solid interface, capturing both reactants and products. Here, we employ cryogenic atom probe tomography to directly analyse frozen liquid solid reaction interfaces at near atomic resolution. Focusing on the interaction of iodide and sodium ions with nanoporous gold, we observe the formation of iodine containing complexes on gold nanoligament surfaces and subsurfaces. These findings reveal aspects of the gold iodide system that were previously hidden, including the reaction mechanism between iodide and gold atoms on the surface, and the multiple gold iodide complexes forming. Our work demonstrates that cryogenic atom probe tomography can provide unprecedented visualisation and characterisation of nanoscale interfaces during chemical and electrochemical reactions, with potential implications for modern manufacturing, energy technologies, and sustainable materials development.</description>

      <title>Rotating Magnetocaloric Effect in Sintered La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$H$_z$ Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: La-Fe-Si-based alloys are among the most application-ready magnetocaloric materials for room-temperature magnetic refrigeration. Powder metallurgy methods have been previously demonstrated to successfully produce structures with sub-mm features for magnetic refrigerators in a scalable method. In this work, we explore the rotating magnetocaloric effect (RMCE) present in a 0.27 mm thin plate of sintered and hydrogenated La(Fe,Mn,Si)$_{13}$. The high aspect ratio ($\sim$50) of the thin plate leads to an anisotropic magnetocaloric effect (MCE), dependent on the relative orientation of the external magnetic field, and an RMCE when the external field is rotated. We find a maximum rotating adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta T_{ad}^{rot}$) of 1.17 K with the rotation of a 1 T magnetic field and 1.12 K when rotating a 0.6 T magnetic field, a reduction of only 4% for a 40% reduction in applied field strength. Magnetostatic computations revealed a considerable rotating isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_{iso}^{rot}$), comparable to the conventional MCE of Gd for similar fields, reaching 3.97 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 1 T and 3.68 J K$^{-1}$ kg$^{-1}$ for 0.6 T (7% reduction), highlighting La-Fe-Mn-Si alloys as high potential candidates for a magnetic refrigerator based on the RMCE utilizing relatively low external magnetic field amplitudes, such as 0.6 T.</description>

      <title>A combined criterion of surface free energy and roughness to predict the wettability of non-ideal low-energy surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of wettability between solid and liquid substances in different fields encourages scientists to develop accurate models to estimate the resultant apparent contact angles. Surface free energy (SFE), which is principally defined for ideal (flat) surfaces, is not applicable to predict the wettability of real (rough) surfaces. This paper introduces a new parameter, namely normalized surface free energy (NSFE) as a combination of SFE and roughness, to predict the contact angle of liquids on non-ideal low-energy surfaces. The remarkable consistency of the predicted and measured contact angles of liquids on some rough surfaces also confirm the validity of the approach.</description>

      <title>Universal rapid machine learning models for predicting unconvoluted and convoluted X-ray Absorption Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) is an essential tool for elucidating the atomic-scale, local three-dimensional (3D) structure of given materials and molecules. The rapid computation of XANES based on molecular 3D structures constitutes a vital element of quantitative XANES analysis. Here, we present an XANES prediction model. It takes 3D structures as input and generates either unconvoluted XANES or convoluted spectra as output, demonstrating excellent generalizability across diverse instrumental broadening. This model has validated its predictive capability for both hard X-ray XAS (exemplified by K-edges of 3d 4d metals and lanthanides) and soft X-ray XAS (using S K-edge as examples). Adopting the model, XANES spectra of multiple elements can be predicted using a single unified model. A highly efficient 3D structure fitting algorithm based on this unconvoluted XANES prediction model, aiming to serve as an online data analysis method suitable for XAS beamlines.</description>

      <title>Chitosan/alginate bionanocomposites adorned with mesoporous silica nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regeneration of oral and craniofacial bone defects ranging from minor periodontal and peri-implant defects to large and critical lesions imposes a substantial global health burden. Conventional therapies are associated with several limitations, highlighting the development of a unique treatment strategy, such as tissue engineering. A well-designed scaffold for bone tissue engineering should possess biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical strength, and osteoconductivity. For this purpose, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) were synthesized and incorporated at different ratios (10, 20, and 30%) into alginate/chitosan (Alg/Chit)-based porous composite scaffolds fabricated through the freeze-drying method. The MSN incorporation significantly improved the mechanical strength of the scaffolds while showing a negligible decreasing effect on the porosity. All of the samples showed desirable swelling behaviors, which is beneficial for cell attachment and proliferation. The MSN-containing scaffolds indicated a decreased hydrolytic degradation in an MSN percentage-dependent manner. The fabricated scaffolds did not depict cytotoxic characteristics. The Alg/Chit/MSN30 scaffolds not only showed noncytotoxic properties, but also increased the cell viability significantly compared to the control group. The biomineralization properties of the MSN-containing nanocomposite scaffolds were significantly higher than the Alg/Chit composite, suggesting the potential of these nanoparticles for bone tissue engineering applications. Taken together, it is concluded that the Alg/Chit/ MSN30 scaffolds are considerable substances for bone tissue regeneration, and MSN has a great tissue engineering potential in addition to its extensive biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>SCALAR: Quantifying Structural Hallucination, Consistency, and Reasoning Gaps in Materials Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to materials science reasoning, yet their behavior under physically structured distribution shifts remains poorly understood. We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

      <description>arXiv:2601.22463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the physical properties of the magnetic van der Waals material GdGaI. Using first-principles calculations, we compute the phonon dispersion of GdGaI and show no imaginary phonons, suggesting that phonon-driven phase transitions are unlikely to occur in GdGaI. Our band calculation reveals that the electronic bands near the Fermi energy are composed of Gd 5d and Ga 4p orbitals. We construct a tight-binding model that incorporates the Gd 5d and Ga 4p orbitals to investigate the magnetic structure. We introduce Kondo coupling between electrons in Gd 5d orbitals and localized spins in Gd 4f orbitals and present the modified band structure when localized spins form a magnetic order characterized by three q vectors that connect the valence and conduction bands. We discuss the origin of the spin order based on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida mechanism and suggest that Coulomb interactions acting on electrons near the Fermi level can contribute to the ordering of localized spins.</description>

      <title>Electronic Origin of Density Wave Orders in a Trilayer Nickelate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has established a new frontier in the study of high-temperature superconductors. However, the underlying pairing mechanism and its relationship to the material's electronic and magnetic ground states remain elusive. Since unconventional superconductivity often emerges from a complex interplay of magnetic correlations, elucidating the magnetic ground state of the nickelates at ambient pressure is crucial for understanding the emergence of superconductivity under high pressure. Here, we combine high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with tight-binding model simulation to investigate the electronic structure of the representative trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. We provide the first experimental evidence of band splitting induced by interlayer coupling and further resolve the momentum-dependent density wave gap structures along all the Fermi surfaces. Our findings identify the mirror-selective Fermi surface nesting as the origin of the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin density wave and demonstrate the dominant role of Ni-3d$_{z^2}$ orbitals in the low-energy physics of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. These results provide a fundamental framework for understanding the magnetic interactions and high-temperature superconductivity mechanism in the Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate family.</description>

      <title>Combining quasi-static and high frequency experiments for the viscoelastic characterization of brain tissue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical models of brain tissue are a beneficial tool to simulate neurosurgical interventions, disease progression, or brain development. However, the accuracy and predictive capacity of such a model relies on a precise experimental characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior. Such a characterization is yet limited by inconsistent or contradictory experimental responses reported in the literature, particularly when measurements are performed in different time or length scales. Although brain tissue has been extensively investigated in previous studies, the combination of experimental findings from different scales has received limited attention. In this study, we combine ex vivo mechanical responses of porcine brain tissue obtained at different time scales in a mechanical model. We investigated the mechanical behavior of three different brain regions in the quasi-static domain with multi-modal large strain rheometer measurements and at high frequencies with magnetic resonance elastography (MRE). A comparative analysis of the mechanical parameters obtained from both experimental techniques demonstrated consistent regional variations in the viscoelastic behavior across the two domains. However, the mechanical behavior changes from a higher elasticity in the quasi-static and low frequency domain to a dominating viscosity at high frequencies. Based on the quasi-static and the high frequency behavior, we calibrated a fractional Kelvin-Voigt model and consequently unified the two responses in a single mechanical model to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the tissue's mechanical behavior.</description>

      <title>Gate-tuneable single-photon emitters in WSe2 monolayer created via AFM nanoindentation on rigid SiO2/Si substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials are envisioned for next-generation quantum applications. However, SPE creation in 2D semiconductors on rigid substrates like SiO2/Si via nanoindentation is a technological gap, critical for interfacing SPEs with photonic circuits and cavities. Here, we report a protocol for deterministically creating SPEs in monolayer WSe2 on SiO2/Si substrates using a sharp diamond AFM (atomic force microscope) tip. A displacement-controlled indentation process is developed, allowing indent depths &gt; 150 nm necessary for creating SPEs. Sharp defect peaks (~200 {\mu}eV) are observed in cryogenic (4K) photoluminescence (PL) spectrum at nanoindented sites and are stable upto ~ 120K. 76% of sites exhibit sharp defect-bound peaks confirmed by power-dependent, temperature-dependent, and time-resolved PL (TRPL). AFM and PL mapping link these peaks to indent periphery. The peaks show sub-linewidth spectral jitter, no blinking, and single-photon nature in second-order autocorrelation measurements. SPEs can be switched on/off, and background emissions suppressed using electrical gating. Gate-voltage dependent TRPL indicate that SPE dynamics can be tuned, depending on nature of SPE, pointing the way to higher-purity SPEs. Our work is directly applicable to other 2D materials and photonic circuit/cavity compatible rigid substrates and is a significant step for scalable SPE technologies.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Bayesian Calibration of Complex and Data-Scarce Models in Applied Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we review the theory involved in the Bayesian calibration of complex computer models, with particular emphasis on their use for applications involving computationally expensive simulations and scarce experimental data. In the article, we present a unified framework that incorporates various Bayesian calibration methods, including well-established approaches. Furthermore, we describe their implementation and use with a new, open-source Python library, ACBICI (A Configurable BayesIan Calibration and Inference Package). All algorithms are implemented with an object-oriented structure designed to be both easy to use and readily extensible. In particular, single-output and multiple-output calibration are addressed in a consistent manner. The article completes the theory and its implementation with practical recommendations for calibrating the problems of interest. These guidelines -- currently unavailable in a unified form elsewhere -- together with the open-source Python library, are intended to support the reliable calibration of computational codes and models commonly used in engineering and related fields. Overall, this work aims to serve both as a comprehensive review of the statistical foundations and (computational) tools required to perform such calculations, and as a practical guide to Bayesian calibration with modern software tools.</description>

      <title>Infinite Magnetoresistance and Vortex Coupling in the Pb/BSCCO Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining superconductivity with spintronics provides exciting opportunities to realize low-dissipation quantum devices. Here we report the synthesis, characterization and magnetotransport measurements of the Pb/Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO) superconducting heterostructures, where an insulating PbO$_{x}$ layer spontaneously forms at the interface. Non-volatile switching between superconducting (logical "0") and normal ("1") states in Pb films by an external field, i.e., infinite magnetoresistance (IMR), can be realized and are attributed to the strong trapping and pinning of vortices in BSCCO. Furthermore, butterfly-shaped hysteresis loops in magnetoresistance, pronounced resistance dips/jumps and thermal reset to superconducting states can be observed and are direct manifestations of the peculiar vortex dynamics in BSCCO and vortex coupling across the Pb/BSCCO interface. Our work demonstrates a simple and effective way to realize IMR through superconducting vortices and opens up new opportunities to study the vortex interactions across the superconducting interfaces.</description>

      <title>Theory of Little-Parks oscillations by vortices in two-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Little-Parks (LP) effect is a quantum phenomenon in which the superconducting transition temperature of a superconducting cylinder (or ring) oscillates periodically as a function of the magnetic flux threading the loop. Recently, multiple experiments have observed half-quantum flux shifts in measurements of LP oscillations, where the oscillations are globally shifted by half a flux quantum compared to conventional cases, a behavior referred to as a $\pi$-ring. Such observations are commonly linked to unconventional pairing symmetries. In this work, we demonstrate that half-quantum flux shifts can arise in two-dimensional (2D) superconducting rings without invoking unconventional pairing symmetry, provided that vortices near the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition are taken into account. Specifically, based on the vortex-charge duality theory near the BKT transition, we map the problem onto a Coulomb gas model, in which the magnetic flux is represented as a pair of opposite boundary charges (or vortices) at the two edges. The screening of these boundary charges by thermally excited vortex-antivortex pairs is investigated through explicit Monte Carlo simulations. Importantly, we demonstrate that the oscillation of the free-vortex density as a function of magnetic flux can exhibit an anomalous half-quantum flux shift, depending on the geometry of the sample. Our work thus predicts the LP oscillations induced by vortices in 2D superconducting rings near the BKT transition, which provides a new mechanism for generating $\pi$-rings.</description>

      <title>Inhibiting Conduction by He Mixing in Interiors of Jupiter and Saturn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the electrical and thermal conductivities and structural properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures under thermodynamic conditions within and beyond the immiscibility range is very important to predict the thermal evolution and internal structure of gas giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn. Here, we propose a novel method to determine the immiscibility boundary accurately without the need for free energy calculations, while providing consistent insights into structural and transport properties of mixtures. We show with direct large-scale ab initio simulations that the insulator-metal transition (IMT) of the hydrogen subsystem is strongly affected by an admixture with a small fraction of helium and occurs at temperatures significantly higher than those of pure hydrogen. At pressures below 150 GPa, the IMT boundary is not related anymore to the H2 subsystem dissociation, the system remains insulating even after the full dissociation of H2 molecules and its transition to an H-He mixture. The offset of the IMT in the H-He mixture relative to the dissociation region in the hydrogen subsystem and the significant reduction of static electrical and thermal conductivity by a factor between two and a few thousand relative to pure hydrogen found in mixtures have consequences for Jupiter and Saturn's thermal evolution, internal structure, and dynamo action, affecting a large fraction of the interior of both planets.</description>

      <title>In-situ Straining of Epitaxial Freestanding Ferroic Films through a MEMS Device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical strain can be used to control physical properties in materials. The experimental investigation of strain-induced effects at the nanoscale is of importance not only for its fundamental aspect, but also for the development of device applications. Transmission X-ray microscopy is a particularly well-suited technique for the nanoscale imaging of magnetic materials, but its compatibility with in-situ mechanical straining of samples is limited. In this work, we present a setup for applying tailored in-situ mechanical strains to freestanding thin films by means of a micro electromechanical system (MEMS) actuator. We then present a proof-of-concept experiment where a freestanding 80 nm thick (001) BiFeO$_3$ multiferroic thin film is strained with the MEMS device, allowing us to control the coupled ferroelectric/spin cycloidal configuration.</description>

Abstract: Lattice deformation is a powerful way to engineer the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, making their precise measurement an important challenge for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enable quantitative strain sensing with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. Using this approach, we precisely quantify the strain-induced shift of the E$_{\rm 2g}$ Raman mode in a multilayer hBN flake under uniaxial stress, establishing V$_\text{B}^-$ centers as a new tool for strain metrology in van der Waals heterostructures. Beyond strain sensing, our work also highlights the unique multimodal sensing functionalities offered by V$_\text{B}^-$ centers, which will be valuable for future studies of strain-engineered 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic domain walls under spin-orbit torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain walls in antiferromagnets under a spin-polarized current present dynamical behavior that is not observed in ferromagnets, and it is tunable by the current polarization. Precessional dynamics is obtained for perpendicular spin polarization. In-plane polarization gives propagating walls. We obtain the velocity as a function of current by a perturbation method for low velocities, and the wall profile is found to lack a definite parity. For high velocities, a power-law decay develops in the trailing tail of the wall. The main features of the wall profile are manifest in a direct solution of an equation that is valid in a limiting case. Oscillatory motion of domain walls is obtained for a spin polarization that has both perpendicular and in-plane components, and an analytical description is given. We discuss the modifications of the dynamics when a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is present. Finally, we give the magnetization of the dynamical walls and find that this can become large, providing a potential method for observations.</description>

      <title>Platform for zero-field isolated skyrmions: 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers on Re(0001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) combined with atomistic spin simulations, we explore the possibility of realizing zero-field isolated skyrmions in three 4$d$/Co atomic bilayers -- Rh/Co, Pd/Co, and Ru/Co -- grown on the Re(0001) surface. Our investigation employs an extended atomistic spin model, which goes beyond the standard model by including the multi-spin higher-order exchange interactions (HOI) in addition to the Heisenberg pairwise exchange interaction, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). All magnetic interactions of the extended spin model are calculated using DFT. The phase diagram obtained from atomistic spin simulations based on this spin model for Rh/Co and Pd/Co on Re(0001) reveals that isolated skyrmions emerge spontaneously on the ferromagnetic background even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The radius of zero-field isolated skyrmions in Rh/Co/Re(0001) is around 6 nm, whereas the radius of those skyrmions in Pd/Co/Re(0001) is about 12 nm. Transition-state theory calculations show that the skyrmions are protected by substantial energy barriers, approximately 150 meV, which predominantly arise from DMI, with a small contribution from the HOI interactions. The height of the barriers suggests that skyrmions could be observed in low-temperature experiments. Based on this work, we propose 4$d$/Co bilayers on Re(0001) as a new platform to realize nanoscale zero-field isolated skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient simulation of photoemission spectroscopy via Kohn-Sham scattering states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient first-principles framework for simulating angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) based on the direct computation of photoelectron states as solutions of the Kohn-Sham equation with scattering boundary conditions. While the one-step theory of photoemission has a long and successful history, existing implementations are often tied to specialized electronic-structure formalisms. Our approach is formally equivalent to the Lippmann-Schwinger formulation, and it is directly compatible with standard plane-wave and real-space density functional theory codes, enabling seamless integration with advanced exchange-correlation functionals and modern electronic-structure workflows. By providing explicit photoelectron wave functions, the method allows for a transparent analysis of matrix-element effects, multiple scattering, and experimental geometry. We demonstrate the accuracy and predictive power of the framework through circular-dichroism ARPES simulations for monolayer graphene and bulk $2H$-WSe$_2$, achieving excellent agreement with experimental data over a wide photon-energy range. Our results establish a robust and accessible route toward quantitative ARPES modeling, opening the door to systematic studies of orbital textures, many-body effects, and nonequilibrium phenomena within widely used ab initio platforms.</description>

      <title>Crystal Representation in the Reciprocal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In crystallography, a structure is typically represented by the arrangement of atoms in the direct space. Furthermore, space group symmetry and Wyckoff site notations are applied to characterize crystal structures with only a few variables. While this representation is effective for data records and human learning, it lacks one-to-one correspondence between the crystal structure and its representation. This is problematic for many applications, such as crystal structure determination, comparison, and more recently, generative model learning. To address this issue, we propose to represent crystals in a four-dimensional (4D) reciprocal space featured by their Cartesian coordinates and scattering factors, which can naturally handle translation invariance and space group symmetry with the help of structure factors. In order to achieve rotational invariance, the 4D coordinates are then transformed into a power spectrum representation under the orthogonal spherical harmonic and radial basis. Hence, this representation captures both periodicity and symmetry of the crystal structure while also providing a continuous representation of the atomic positions and cell parameters in the direct space. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by applying it to several crystal structure matching and reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectrically Switchable Chirality in Topological Superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between ferroelectricity, magnetism, and superconductivity provides a rich platform for discovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we develop an effective theory and propose a heterostructure composed of an antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ coupled with the s-wave superconductor Fe(Se,Te), enabling the realization of chiral topological superconductivity (CTSC) with switchable chirality. The chirality of the CTSC is controlled by the direction of spontaneous polarization, which arises from interlayer sliding-induced ferroelectricity or charge transfer in the bilayer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$. This sliding mechanism breaks the $\mathcal{M}_{z}\mathcal{T}$ and $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetries, leading to the anomalous Hall effect in the spin polarized metallic Dirac band and drives the emergence of CTSC when the s-wave superconductivity appears. Our work not only provides a new pathway to achieve and control topological superconductivity but also opens avenues for experimental exploration of Majorana physics and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Alignment behavior of 2D diopsides (d-silicates) under the influence of an AC electric field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling the alignment of two dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for optimizing their electronic and mechanical properties in next generation devices. This study explores how electric fields can manipulate the orientation of 2D diopside (CaMgSi2O6) flakes, a flexible silicate material, through a phenomenon called flexoelectricity, where applied voltage generates mechanical strain. We exfoliated diopside crystals into ultrathin flakes, placed them on microelectrodes, and used AC electric fields to induce alignment via acoustic strain. Raman spectroscopy showed that the flakes reoriented/realigned under the field, with vibrational peaks weakening most at high frequencies (10 MHz). Electrical tests revealed this alignment improves conductivity by 20-30%, as straightened flakes create better pathways for current flow. Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations further explained how these flakes naturally align on surfaces within picoseconds, matching our experimental observations. Together, these findings demonstrate a practical way to tune diopside properties using electric fields, opening doors for its use in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy devices.</description>

Abstract: Non-trivial topological phases often emerge in narrow-gap semiconductors with a delicate blend of spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation. The diamond-lattice allotrope of Sn ($\alpha$-Sn) exemplifies this behavior, hosting multiple topological phases that can be tuned by small distortions in the lattice. Despite rapid experimental progress, theoretical descriptions of $\alpha$-Sn lack predictive power and rely mainly on tight-binding models and density functional theory with uncontrolled approximations. We employ first-principles fully self-consistent, relativistic GW (scGW) to overcome these limitations. The scGW recovers the experimentally observed zero-gap semiconductor and the strain-induced topological insulator and Dirac semimetal phases, while also predicting new trivial and topological insulators and a Dirac semimetal phase, further demonstrating the versatility of $\alpha$-Sn for band engineering. Additionally, we propose a robust diagnostic of topological behavior based on a combined analysis of band and orbital-occupation dispersions, tailored for correlated methods where standard mean-field-based topological invariants fall short. Our findings pave the way for studying a broad class of topological materials using accurate first-principles methods beyond density functional theory.</description>

      <title>A finite viscoelastic constitutive model for low to high strain rate response of elastomers with application of strain rate-induced glass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous elastomers exhibit significant rate-stiffening and unique viscous flow characteristics across a wide range of strain rates, often undergoing glass transition above a strain rate threshold. We have developed a thermodynamically-consistent and micromechanically-inspired constitutive model for soft elastomeric materials to capture the rate-dependent stress-strain behavior and hysteresis when subjected to low to high strain rates. Our proposed constitutive model encapsulates the viscous flow of materials through molecular motion at low strain rates and local rearrangement and alignment at high strain rates, essentially covering the glass transition. We applied our constitutive model to uniaxial compression experiments performed at low and high strain rates for polyborosiloxane (PBS) to identify the material parameters, and subsequently, performed numerical simulations of single and multi-cycle compression, stress relaxation, and small amplitude oscillatory tension-compression. Our analyses indicate that the model predicts higher total energy dissipation with increasing strain rate; however, dissipation associated with molecular relaxation decreases (forming a cusp) because, beyond a crossover strain rate, molecular rearrangement and alignment become dominant, which is consistent with the onset of the glass transition. For cyclic loading-unloading, we observed that dissipation over a cycle remains constant at low strain rate but decreases non-monotonically at high strain rates before becoming constant with peak stress over the cycle becoming higher, which can be interpreted as more loading being carried elastically by the polymer network as the molecular rearrangement process occurs. Additionally, our model was able to predict the qualitative nature of the storage modulus and loss modulus in the limit of small strain over a wide range of frequency sweeps.</description>

      <title>Interface effects and dielectric mismatch in ultrathin silicon on insulator films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of interface states and dielectric mismatch is studied in ultrathin P-doped silicon-on-insulator (SOI) films with thickness of the device layer ($H_{SOI}$) varying from 30 to 8 nm and dopant concentration ($n_{D}$) ranging from 10$^{18}$ to nearly 10$^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$. P concentration is determined by Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Sample resistivity ($\rho$), carrier concentration ($n_e$), and mobility ($\mu_e$) are extracted by combining sheet resistance and Hall measurements in van der Pauw configuration. When $H_{SOI}$ = 30 nm, transport properties at room temperature are fully compatible with those of a similarly doped bulk Si. Progressive 2D confinement by reduction of $H_{SOI}$ below 30 nm results in a reduction of the carrier concentration and a concomitant degradation of $\mu_e$. These effects, which are steadily enhanced decreasing $n_D$, are attributed to non-passivated interface states at the SiO$_2$/Si interface and can be significantly mitigated by high temperature rapid thermal oxidation (RTO). The effectiveness of this approach was verified by electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements, which allowed the assessment of the quality of the RTO-SiO$_2$/Si interface and the correlation with observed electrical properties. After effective interface engineering, low temperature electrical characterization revealed a significant increase in P ionization energy in samples with $H_{SOI}$ &lt;= 15 nm, a result directly related to the dielectric mismatch.</description>

      <title>PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a widely used full-field measurement technique, but both open-source and commercial packages often have limitations such as operating-system restrictions, lack of support for deployment on computing clusters, and poor scalability to gigapixel-scale images common in Scanning Electron Microscopy DIC (SEM-DIC). Objective: Pyvale is an open-source software package designed for sensor simulation, uncertainty quantification, placement optimization, and calibration/validation. A key component of this is the development of a dedicated 2D DIC module intended for standalone use and integration within broader workflows. Methods: Pyvale provides a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled routines underneath. At its core is a multithreaded, reliability-guided DIC algorithm. Its open-source MIT license enables wide deployment, including on computing clusters and in automated pipelines. Results: Benchmarking with the publicly available 2D DIC challenge 2.0 dataset shows that Pyvale achieves metrological performance comparable to existing commercial and open-source DIC codes. It can correlate gigapixel-scale image pairs in under 5 minutes on high-specification desktop workstations, with memory peaking at approximately 50 GB. Conclusions: Pyvale's strong metrological foundation, coupled with its scalability for SEM-DIC, positions it as a platform for sustained, community-driven development. Its design and licensing provide a foundation for future improvements in open-source DIC and integration into experimental design and validation workflows.</description>

      <title>Diffusive and hydrodynamic magnetotransport around a density perturbation in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study current flow around a density inhomogeneity in a two-dimensional electron gas in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The inhomogeneity is parametrized by a power-law tail with an exponent $\beta &gt; 2$. We show that current and electrochemical potential are exponentially suppressed inside a surrounding area much larger than the geometric size of the perturbation. The corresponding ``no-go'' radius grows as a certain power of the magnetic field. Residual current and potential exhibit spiraling patterns inside the no-go region. Outside of it, they acquire corrections inversely proportional to the distance, which is known as the Landauer resistivity dipole. The Landauer dipole is rotated by the angle $\pi (1 - 1 / \beta)$ with respect to the average electric field. The rotation direction depends on whether the local density is raised or lowered. We also consider the effect of electron viscosity and show that the variation of the no-go radius with magnetic field becomes more rapid if viscosity is large enough. The Landauer dipole size is set by the Gurzhi length, which is much larger than the no-go radius, which is in turn much larger than the geometric size of the perturbation. Our results may be useful for interpreting nanoimaging of current distribution in graphene and other two-dimensional systems.</description>
