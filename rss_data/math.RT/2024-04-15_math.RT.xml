      <title>An Introduction to Deligne Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work hopes to be an introduction to Deligne categories for someone familiar with classical representation theory and some category theory. In the first chapter, we motivate and define (symmetric) tensor categories, construct the Deligne categories, and prove their universal properties. In the second chapter, we define ultraproducts and use them to construct the Deligne categories in a different way; in particular, this construction works in positive characteristic. In the third chapter, we connect Deligne categories to the classical categories by discussing simple objects and explaining what happens in the $t = n$ case. In the last chapter, along with recommendations for further and related reading, we give an example of an investigation of Harish-Chandra bimodules in representation theory in complex rank, which is a joint work with Alexandra Utiralova (arXiv:2107.03173).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe integral representations of the alternating group $A_4$, in particular, the Auslander-Reiten quiver of its 2-adic representations.
  Using these results we calculate Tate cohomologies of all $A_4$-lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\bf G}$ be a connected reductive algebraic group defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\Bbbk$ be a field such that $\text{char}\ \Bbbk\ne \text{char}\ \mathbb{F}_q$ and $\text{char}\ \Bbbk \geq 5$. In this paper, we show that $ \text{Ext}_{\bf G}(M, \text{tr})=0$ for any object $M$ in the principal representation category $\mathscr{O}({\bf G})$, where $\text{tr}$ is the trivial module.</description>

      <title>Classification of finite type fusion quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, the second author introduced the concept of Coxeter quivers, generalizing several previous notions of a quiver representation. Finite type Coxeter quivers were classified, and their indecomposable objects were shown to be in bijection with positive roots, generalizing a classical theorem of Gabriel. In this paper we define fusion quivers, a natural generalization of Coxeter quivers. We classify the finite type fusion quivers, and prove the analogue of Gabriel's theorem. As a special case, this proves a generalised quantum McKay correspondence for fusion categories, an analogue of Auslander--Reiten's result for finite groups in the fusion categorical setting.</description>

      <title>Derived geometric Satake for $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{\times 3}/\mathrm{PGL}_2^\mathrm{diag}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the local relative geometric Langlands conjecture of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh for the spherical subgroup $\mathrm{PGL}_2^\mathrm{diag}$ of the triple product $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{\times 3}$ (and also for the spherical subgroup $\mathrm{G}_2$ of $\mathrm{SO}_8/\mu_2$), whose corresponding Langlands dual $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\times 3}$-variety can be identified with the symplectic vector space $(\mathbf{A}^2)^{\otimes 3} \cong \mathbf{A}^8$ of $2\times 2 \times 2$-cubes. Our analysis relies on a construction of Bhargava relating $2 \times 2 \times 2$-cubes to Gauss composition on quadratic forms, arising here as the moment map for the Hamiltonian $\mathrm{SL}_2^{\times 3}$-action on $(\mathbf{A}^2)^{\otimes 3}$, and the Cayley hyperdeterminant as studied by Gelfand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky.</description>

      <title>The thirty-seven measures on permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work with Harman, we introduced a notion of measure on a class of finite relational structures. In this note, we consider measures on the class of permutations, i.e., finite sets with two total orders. Using a method of Nekrasov, we show that there are exactly 37 measures. Two of these measures lead to a new pre-Tannakian tensor category.</description>

      <title>Link patterns and elliptic Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the following three families of geometric objects: Schubert varieties in flag manifolds, matrix Schubert varieties, and Borel orbits of 2-nilpotent matrices. The first family is governed by permutations, the second by partial permutations, and the last one by "link patterns". These geometric objects admit characteristic classes in equivariant elliptic cohomology obtained within the framework created by Borisov and Libgober. We construct a Hecke-type algebra for computing elliptic classes and extend its action to include partial permutations and linking patterns. A uniform point of view facilitates a better understanding of duality.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of three dimensional automorphic Galois representations over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho_\ell$ be a semisimple $\ell$-adic representation of a number field $K$ that is unramified almost everywhere. We introduce a new notion called weak abelian direct summands of $\rho_\ell$ and completely characterize them, for example, if the algebraic monodromy of $\rho_\ell$ is connected. If $\rho_\ell$ is in addition $E$-rational for some number field $E$, we prove that the weak abelian direct summands are locally algebraic (and thus de Rham). We also show that the weak abelian parts of a connected semisimple Serre compatible system form again such a system.
  Using our results on weak abelian direct summands, when $K$ is totally real and $\rho_\ell$ is the three-dimensional $\ell$-adic representation attached to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic, not necessarily polarizable representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A}_K)$ together with an isomorphism $\mathbb{C}\simeq \overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$, we prove that $\rho_\ell$ is irreducible. We deduce in this case also some $\ell$-adic Hodge theoretic properties of $\rho_\ell$ if $\ell$ belongs to a Dirichlet density one set of primes.</description>

      <title>Quiver matroids -- Matroid morphisms, quiver Grassmannians, their Euler characteristics and $\mathbb{F}_1$-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce morphisms for matroids with coefficients (in the sense of Baker and Bowler) and quiver matroids. We investigate their basic properties, such as functoriality, duality, minors and cryptomorphic characterizations in terms of vectors, circuits and bases (a.k.a. Grassmann-Pl\"ucker functions). We generalize quiver matroids to quiver matroid bundles and construct their moduli space, which is an $\mathbb{F}_1$-analogue of a complex quiver Grassmannian. Eventually we introduce a suitable interpretation of $\mathbb{F}_1$-points for these moduli spaces, so that in 'nice' cases their number is equal to the Euler characteristic of the associated complex quiver Grassmannian.</description>

Abstract: We discuss formulas for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of summands in tensor powers in certain (finite or infinite) monoidal categories. Our focus is on monoidal categories with infinitely many indecomposable objects, with our main tools being generalized Perron-Frobenius theory alongside techniques from random walks.</description>

      <title>Representations of Multiparameter Quantum Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct representations of the quantum algebras ~$U_{q{\bf q}}(gl(n))$ and ~$U_{q{\bf q}}(sl(n))$~ which are in duality with the multiparameter quantum groups ~$GL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$, ~$SL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$,~ respectively. These objects depend on ~$n(n-1)/2+1$~ deformation parameters ~$q,q_{ij}$ ($1\leq i &lt;j\leq n$) which is the maximal possible number in the case of $GL(n)$. The representations are labelled by $n-1$ complex numbers ~$r_i$~ and are acting in the space of formal power series of ~$n(n-1)/2$~ non-commuting variables. These variables generate quantum flag manifolds of ~$GL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$, ~$SL_{q{\bf q}}(n)$. The case $n=3$ is treated in more detail.</description>

      <title>On the intersection of local Arthur packets for classical groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups, we develop an account of theory on the intersection problem of local Arthur packets. Specifically, following Atobe's reformulation on M{\oe}glin's construction of local Arthur packets, we give a complete set of operators on the construction data, based on which, we provide algorithms and Sage codes to determine whether a given representation is of Arthur type. Furthermore, for any representation $\pi$ of Arthur type, we give a precise formula for the set $$ \Psi(\pi)=\{ \text{local Arthur parameter }\psi \ | \ \text{the local Arthur packet } \Pi_{\psi} \text{ contains } \pi\}.$$
  Our results have many applications, including the precise counting of tempered representations in any local Arthur packet, specifying and characterizing "the" local Arthur parameter in $\Psi(\pi)$ for $\pi$, especially when $\pi$ belongs to several local Arthur packets but does not belong to any local $L$-packet of Arthur type.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the dg algebra of global functions on commuting stacks of complex reductive groups using tools from Betti Geometric Langlands. In particular, we prove that the ring of invariant functions on the commuting scheme is reduced. Our main technical results include: a semi-orthogonal decomposition of the cocenter of the affine Hecke category; and the calculation of endomorphisms of a Whittaker sheaf in a diagram organizing parabolic induction of character sheaves.</description>

      <title>Relative Auslander--Gorenstein Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study relative Auslander--Gorenstein pairs. This consists of a finite-dimensional Gorenstein algebra together with a self-orthogonal module that provides a further homological feature of the algebra in terms of relative dominant dimension. These pairs will be called relative Auslander pairs whenever the algebra in question has finite global dimension. We characterize relative Auslander pairs by the existence and uniqueness of tilting-cotilting modules having higher values relative dominant and codominant dimension with respect to the self-orthogonal module. The same characterisation remains valid for relative Auslander--Gorenstein pairs if the self-orthogonal module has injective or projective dimension at most one. Our relative approach generalises and unifies the known results from the literature, for instance, the characterization of minimal Auslander--Gorenstein algebras. As an application of our methods, we prove that for any relative Auslander pair pieces of the module category of the endomorphism algebra of the self-orthogonal module can be identified with pieces of the module category of the endomorphism algebra of the unique tilting-cotilting module associated with the relative Auslander pair. We provide explicit examples of relative Auslander pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an elementary method to compute spaces of equivariant maps from a homogeneous space $G/H$ of a Lie group $G$ to a module of this group. The Lie group is not required to be compact. More generally, we study spaces of invariant sections in homogeneous vector bundles, and take a special interest in the case where the fibres are algebras. These latter cases have a natural global algebra structure. We classify these automorphic algebras for the case where the homogeneous space has compact stabilisers. This work has applications in the theoretical development of geometric deep learning and also in the theory of automorphic Lie algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show that, over a nonarchimedean local field, the rigid refined local Langlands correspondence and associated endoscopic character identities for connected reductive $G$ follow if one only has them for all such $G$ with connected center. The strategy is to construct a projective system of central extensions and then take limits of the Langlands correspondences (and endoscopic data) of each group in the system. As an application, we prove the equivalence of the rigid refined local Langlands correspondence and its analogue for isocrystals, generalizing the work of [Kal18] in the $p$-adic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1807.00118v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spaces of twisted conformal blocks attached to a $\Gamma$-curve $\Sigma$ with marked $\Gamma$-orbits and an action of $\Gamma$ on a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group. We prove that if $\Gamma$ stabilizes a Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, then Propagation Theorem and Factorization Theorem hold. We endow a flat projective connection on the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks attached to a smooth family of pointed $\Gamma$-curves; in particular, it is locally free. We also prove that the sheaf of twisted conformal blocks on the stable compactification of Hurwitz stack is locally free.
  Let $\mathscr{G}$ be the parahoric Bruhat-Tits group scheme on the quotient curve $\Sigma/\Gamma$ obtained via the $\Gamma$-invariance of Weil restriction associated to $\Sigma$ and the simply-connected simple algebraic group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that the space of twisted conformal blocks can be identified with the space of generalized theta functions on the moduli stack of quasi-parabolic $\mathscr{G}$-torsors on $\Sigma/\Gamma$ when the level $c$ is divisible by $|\Gamma|$ (establishing a conjecture due to Pappas-Rapoport).</description>

      <title>Tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.12491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the tamely ramified geometric Langlands correspondence in positive characteristic for $GL_n(k)$. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt; n$. Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over $k$ with marked points, and fix a parabolic subgroup of $GL_n(k)$ at each marked point. We denote by $\text{Bun}_{n,P}$ the moduli stack of (quasi-)parabolic vector bundles on $X$, and by $\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}$ the moduli stack of parabolic flat connections such that the residue is nilpotent with respect to the parabolic reduction at each marked point. We construct an equivalence between the bounded derived category $D^{b}(\text{Qcoh}({\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}^{0}}))$ of quasi-coherent sheaves on an open substack $\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}^{0}\subset\mathcal{L}oc_{n,P}$, and the bounded derived category $D^{b}(\mathcal{D}^{0}_{{\text{Bun}}_{n,P}}\text{-mod})$ of $\mathcal{D}^{0}_{{\text{Bun}}_{n,P}}$-modules, where $\mathcal{D}^0_{\text{Bun}_{n,P}}$ is a localization of $\mathcal{D}_{\text{Bun}_{n,P}}$ the sheaf of crystalline differential operators on $\text{Bun}_{n,P}$. Thus we extend the work of Bezrukavnikov-Braverman to the tamely ramified case. We also prove a correspondence between flat connections on $X$ with regular singularities and meromorphic Higgs bundles on the Frobenius twist $X^{(1)}$ of $X$ with first order poles .</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.08846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a uniform approach to the construction of the groups of type $\mathrm{E}_6$ over arbitrary fields without using Lie theory. This gives a simple description of the group generators and some of the subgroup structure. In the finite case our approach also permits relatively straightforward computation of the group order.</description>

      <title>Mutually unbiased bases: polynomial optimization and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05698v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of $k$ orthonormal bases of $\mathbb C^d$ is called mutually unbiased if $|\langle e,f\rangle |^2 = 1/d$ whenever $e$ and $f$ are basis vectors in distinct bases. A natural question is for which pairs $(d,k)$ there exist~$k$ mutually unbiased bases in dimension $d$. The (well-known) upper bound $k \leq d+1$ is attained when~$d$ is a power of a prime. For all other dimensions it is an open problem whether the bound can be attained. Navascu\'es, Pironio, and Ac\'in showed how to reformulate the existence question in terms of the existence of a certain $C^*$-algebra. This naturally leads to a noncommutative polynomial optimization problem and an associated hierarchy of semidefinite programs. The problem has a symmetry coming from the wreath product of $S_d$ and $S_k$.
  We exploit this symmetry (analytically) to reduce the size of the semidefinite programs making them (numerically) tractable. A key step is a novel explicit decomposition of the $S_d \wr S_k$-module $\mathbb C^{([d]\times [k])^t}$ into irreducible modules. We present numerical results for small $d,k$ and low levels of the hierarchy. In particular, we obtain sum-of-squares proofs for the (well-known) fact that there do not exist $d+2$ mutually unbiased bases in dimensions~$d=2,3,4,5,6,7,8$. Moreover, our numerical results indicate that a sum-of-squares refutation, in the above-mentioned framework, of the existence of more than $3$ MUBs in dimension $6$ requires polynomials of total degree at least~$12$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the technique of $p$-adic integration, we prove the topological mirror symmetry conjecture of Hausel-Thaddeus for the moduli spaces of (strongly) parabolic Higgs bundles for the structure groups $\text{SL}_n$ and $\text{PGL}_n$, building on previous work of Groechenig-Wyss-Ziegler on the non-parabolic case. We also prove the $E$-polynomial of the smooth moduli space of parabolic $\text{GL}_n$-Higgs bundles is independent of the degree of the underlying vector bundles.</description>

      <title>Tropical Geometry, Quantum Affine Algebras, and Scattering Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05618v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to make a connection between tropical geometry, representations of quantum affine algebras, and scattering amplitudes in physics. The connection allows us to study important and difficult questions in these areas:
  (1) We give a systematic construction of prime modules (including prime non-real modules) of quantum affine algebras using tropical geometry. We also introduce new objects which generalize positive tropical Grassmannians.
  (2) We propose a generalization of Grassmannian string integrals in physics, in which the integrand is no longer a finite, but rather an infinite product indexed by prime modules of a quantum affine algebra. We give a general formula of $u$-variables using prime tableaux (corresponding to prime modules of quantum affine algebras of type $A$) and Auslander-Reiten quivers of Grassmannian cluster categories.
  (3) We study limit $g$-vectors of cluster algebras. This is another way to obtain prime non-real modules of quantum affine algebras systematically. Using limit $g$-vectors, we construct new examples of non-real modules of quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized double affine Hecke algebras (GDAHA) are flat deformations of the group algebras of $2$-dimensional crystallographic groups associated to star-shaped simply laced affine Dynkin diagrams. In this paper, we first construct a functor that sends representations of the $\tilde D_4$-type GDAHA to representations of the $\tilde E_6$-type one for specialised parameters. Then, under no restrictions on the parameters, we construct embeddings of both GDAHAs of type $\tilde D_4$ and $\tilde E_6$ into matrix algebras over quantum cluster $\mathcal{X}$-varieties, thus linking to the theory of higher Teichm\"uller spaces. For $\tilde E_6$, the two explicit representations we provide over distinct quantum tori are shown to be related by quiver reductions and mutations.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \operatorname{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity.
  Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source.
  We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld rational fractions for affine Kac-Moody quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a precise connection between the new Drinfeld presentation of a quantum affine algebra $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the new Drinfeld presentation of affine coideal subalgebras of split type recently discovered by Lu and Wang. In particular, we establish a ``factorization formula'', expressing the commuting ``Drinfeld-Cartan''-type operators $\Theta_{i,k}$ in a coideal subalgebra in terms of the corresponding Drinfeld generators of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$, modulo the ``Drinfeld positive half" of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We study the spectra of these operators on finite dimensional representations, and describe them in terms of rational functions with an extra symmetry. These results can be seen as the starting point of a $q$-character theory for affine Kac--Moody quantum symmetric pairs. Additionally, we prove a compatibility result linking Lusztig's and the Lu-Wang-Zhang braid group actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of elements of the Iwahori-Weyl group of a reductive group that we call positive Coxeter elements. This class consists of elements which are linked to partial Coxeter elements in the finite Weyl group in a certain canonical way, extending the more restrictive notion of finite Coxeter part previously introduced by He-Nie-Yu. We show that the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties associated with such elements have a very simple and explicitly described geometric structure. Conversely, we explain how some of these geometric properties can be used to characterize elements of positive Coxeter type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $b$-Hurwitz numbers with a rational weight are obtained by taking an explicit limit of a Whittaker vector for the $\mathcal{W}$-algebra of type $A$. Our result is a vast generalization of several previous results that treated the monotone case, and the cases of quadratic and cubic polynomial weights. It also provides an interpretation of the associated Whittaker vector in terms of generalized branched coverings that might be of independent interest. Our result is new even in the special case $b=0$ that corresponds to classical hypergeometric Hurwitz numbers, and implies that they are governed by the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin. This gives an independent proof of the recent result of Bychkov-Dunin-Barkowski-Kazarian-Shadrin.</description>

Abstract: Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh described a conjectural extension of the geometric Satake equivalence to spherical varieties, whose spectral decomposition is described by Hamiltonian varieties. The goal of this article is to study their conjecture, especially in the case of spherical varieties of relative rank 1, using tools from homotopy theory. Our discussion relates their conjecture to classical topics in homotopy theory such as the EHP sequence and Hopf fibrations, as well as more modern topics such as Hochschild (co)homology. We will also study an analogue of the derived geometric Satake equivalence and of the Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh conjecture with coefficients in connective complex K-theory. In this generalized setting, the dual group (a la Langlands, Gaitsgory--Nadler, Sakellaridis--Venkatesh, Knop--Schalke) remains unchanged, but the specific dual "representation" of the dual group changes. On the spectral/Langlands dual side, we expect that the appropriate replacement of Hamiltonian varieties are given by what we term "ku-Hamiltonian varieties"; this is a notion interpolating between Hamiltonian and quasi-Hamiltonian varieties (a la Alekseev--Malkin--Meinrenken). Finally, we suggest possible generalizations to more exotic cohomology theories such as complex cobordism.</description>

      <title>Wall-Crossing Effects on Quiver BPS Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BPS states in supersymmetric theories can admit additional algebro-geometric structures in their spectra, described as quiver Yangian algebras. Equivariant fixed points on the quiver variety are interpreted as vectors populating a representation module, and matrix elements for the generators are then defined as Duistermaat-Heckman integrals in the vicinity of these points. The well-known wall-crossing phenomena are that the fixed point spectrum establishes a dependence on the stability (Fayet-Illiopolous) parameters $\zeta$, jumping abruptly across the walls of marginal stability, which divide the $\zeta$-space into a collection of stability chambers -- ``phases'' of the theory. The standard construction of the quiver Yangian algebra relies heavily on the molten crystal model, valid in a sole cyclic chamber where all the $\zeta$-parameters have the same sign. We propose to lift this restriction and investigate the effects of the wall-crossing phenomena on the quiver Yangian algebra and its representations -- starting with the example of affine super-Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. In addition to the molten crystal construction more general atomic structures appear, in other non-cyclic phases (chambers of the $\zeta$-space). We call them glasses and also divide in a few different classes. For some of the new phases we manage to associate an algebraic structure again as a representation of the same affine Yangian $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$. This observation supports an earlier conjecture that the BPS algebraic structures can be considered as new wall-crossing invariants.</description>
