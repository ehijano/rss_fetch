      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Irregular Domain Mapping and Partial Differential Equations solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08622v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution of partial differential equations (PDES) on irregular domains has long been a subject of significant research interest. In this work, we present an approach utilizing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to achieve irregular-to-regular domain mapping. Thus we can use finite difference method and physics-informed convolutional neural networks to solve PDEs on rectangular grids instead of the original irregular boundary.
  Structured grids on irregular domains are obtained by inverse mapping. We demonstrate PINN's versatile capability to produce customized structured grids tailored to diverse computational requirements, thereby significantly facilitating PDEs solving.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Operators for Generalizable and Label-Free Inference of Temperature-Dependent Thermoelectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), such as thermal conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, is essential for reliable modeling and efficient design of thermoelectric devices. However, their nonlinear temperature dependence and coupled transport behavior make both forward simulation and inverse identification difficult, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. In this study, we develop a physics-informed machine learning approach that employs physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving forward and inverse problems in thermoelectric systems, and neural operators (PINO) to enable generalization across diverse material systems. The PINN enables field reconstruction and material property inference by embedding governing transport equations into the loss function, while the PINO generalizes this inference capability across diverse materials without retraining. Trained on simulated data for 20 p-type materials and evaluated on 60 unseen materials, the PINO model demonstrates accurate and label-free inference of TEPs using only sparse field data. The proposed framework offers a scalable, generalizable, and data-efficient approach for thermoelectric property identification, paving the way for high-throughput screening and inverse design of advanced thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Towards AI-assisted Neutrino Flavor Theory Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle physics theories, such as those which explain neutrino flavor mixing, arise from a vast landscape of model-building possibilities. A model's construction typically relies on the intuition of theorists. It also requires considerable effort to identify appropriate symmetry groups, assign field representations, and extract predictions for comparison with experimental data. We develop an Autonomous Model Builder (AMBer), a framework in which a reinforcement learning agent interacts with a streamlined physics software pipeline to search these spaces efficiently. AMBer selects symmetry groups, particle content, and group representation assignments to construct viable models while minimizing the number of free parameters introduced. We validate our approach in well-studied regions of theory space and extend the exploration to a novel, previously unexamined symmetry group. While demonstrated in the context of neutrino flavor theories, this approach of reinforcement learning with physics software feedback may be extended to other theoretical model-building problems in the future.</description>

      <title>Portal for High-Precision Atomic Data and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We've developed a scalable and sustainable online atomic data portal with an automated interface for easy update and addition of new data. The current portal provides energies, transition matrix elements, transition rates, radiative lifetimes, branching ratios, polarizabilities, hyperfine constants, and other data, for 28 atoms and ions. It also features an interactive polarizability plotting interface for neutral atoms and singly-charged ions. The data production is supported by recent developments of open-access atomic software based on our research codes, including new workflow algorithms, which allow large volumes of such data to be generated with automated accuracy assessments. This entails a new method of comparing our calculated values with data from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database. All calculated values include estimated uncertainties. Data for more systems will be added in the future. Experimental values are included with references, where high-precision data are available.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Rapid Crystal Structure Generation Towards a Target Local Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of material design, traditional crystal structure prediction approaches require extensive structural sampling through computationally expensive energy minimization methods using either force fields or quantum mechanical simulations. While emerging artificial intelligence (AI) generative models have shown great promise in generating realistic crystal structures more rapidly, most existing models fail to account for the unique symmetries and periodicity of crystalline materials, and they are limited to handling structures with only a few tens of atoms per unit cell. Here, we present a symmetry-informed AI generative approach called Local Environment Geometry-Oriented Crystal Generator (LEGO-xtal) that overcomes these limitations. Our method generates initial structures using AI models trained on an augmented small dataset, and then optimizes them using machine learning structure descriptors rather than traditional energy-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LEGO-xtal by expanding from 25 known low-energy sp2 carbon allotropes to over 1,700, all within 0.5 eV/atom of the ground-state energy of graphite. This framework offers a generalizable strategy for the targeted design of materials with modular building blocks, such as metal-organic frameworks and next-generation battery materials.</description>

      <title>Exploring the energy landscape of the Thomson problem: local minima and stationary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive numerical investigation of the energy landscape of the Thomson problem for systems up to $N=150$. Our results show the number of distinct configurations grows exponentially with $N$, but significantly faster than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that the average energy gap between independent configurations at a given $N$ decays exponentially with $N$, dramatically increasing the computational complexity for larger systems. Finally, we developed a novel approach that reformulates the search for stationary points in the Thomson problem (or similar systems) as an equivalent minimization problem using a specifically designed potential. Leveraging this method, we performed a detailed exploration of the solution landscape for $N\leq24$ and estimated the growth of the number of stationary states to be exponential in $N$.</description>

      <title>Theory of Semi-Deterministic Quantum Dot Placement in Heteroepitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving deterministic placement of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) during epitaxial growth is essential for the reliable and efficient fabrication of high-quality single-photon sources and solid-state cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems, yet it remains a significant challenge due to the inherent stochasticity of QD nucleation processes. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that deterministic QD nucleation within a pristine growth region can be achieved by engineering the boundary geometry of that region. During epitaxial growth, adatoms initially move toward the boundary and promote the formation of primary QDs along the boundary, driven by curvature and diffusion anisotropy. The resulting primary QDs distribution will generate many-body interactions that dynamically reshape the chemical potential landscape for subsequently deposited adatoms, enabling the formation of secondary QDs within the pristine growth region. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for reliable patterning of high optical-quality QDs, with potential applications in next-generation quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods: c-reflection symmetry and factorization of the Butcher tableau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are further examined as a follow-up to the recent work. It is found that the augmented Butcher tableau factorizes into a product of matrices with special properties. Those properties reveal that the 2N-storage methods of the order of global accuracy less than five possess a symmetry, called c-reflection symmetry, i.e. most methods exist in pairs. A transformation that relates the Butcher tableaux of the pairs is found and the fact that the c-reflected method satisfies the same order conditions as the original one is proven. Numerical evidence that validates the analytic results is presented. Branches of solutions for (5,4) methods, first explored by Carpenter and Kennedy, are constructed numerically. Four new (5,4) schemes with coefficients expressed in radicals and one with rational coefficients are examined for illustration. Eight new (6,4) schemes, some of which can be expressed in rationals or radicals, and one (8,4) scheme, are studied to understand the practical implications of the c-reflection symmetry for methods with higher number of stages. In the absence of closed-form analytic solutions for 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods of order four and above, the general symmetry properties, as well as some specific analytic solutions presented here, may help in development and optimization of 2N-storage schemes.</description>

      <title>KP-PINNs: Kernel Packet Accelerated Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08563v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

Abstract: Here, we propose a comprehensive first-principle atomistic approach to predict the Wulff-Kaischew equilibrium shape of crystals heterogeneously integrated on a dissimilar material. This method uses both reconstructed surface and interface absolute energies, as determined by density functional theory, to infer the morphology and wetting properties of Volmer-Weber islands over the whole range of accessible chemical potentials. The predicted equilibrium shapes of GaP crystals heterogeneously grown on Si, are found to be in good agreements with experimental observations performed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. Such method provides a tool for optimization of hetero-structured, multifunctional and smart materials and devices.</description>

      <title>A multi-physics model for dislocation driven spontaneous grain nucleation and microstructure evolution in polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The granular microstructure of metals evolves significantly during thermomechanical processing through viscoplastic deformation and recrystallization. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries (GBs), subgrains, localized deformation bands, and non-uniform dislocation distributions critically influence grain nucleation and growth during recrystallization. Traditionally, modeling this coupled evolution involves separate, specialized frameworks for mechanical deformation and microstructural kinetics, typically used in a staggered manner. Nucleation is often introduced ad hoc, with nuclei seeded at predefined sites based on criteria like critical dislocation density, stress or strain. This is a consequence of the inherent limitations of the staggered approach, where newly formed GBs or grains have to be incorporated with additional processing. In this work, we propose a unified, thermodynamically consistent field theory that enables spontaneous nucleation driven by stored dislocations at GBs. The model integrates Cosserat crystal plasticity with the Henry-Mellenthin-Plapp orientation phase field approach, allowing the simulation of key microstructural defects, as well as curvature- and stored energy-driven grain boundary migration. The unified approach enables seamless identification of GBs that emerge from deformation and nucleation. Nucleation is activated through a coupling function that links dislocation-related free energy contributions to the phase field. Dislocation recovery occurs both at newly formed nuclei and behind migrating GBs. The model's capabilities are demonstrated using periodic bicrystal and polycrystal simulations, where mechanisms such as strain-induced boundary migration, subgrain growth, and coalescence are captured. The proposed spontaneous nucleation mechanism offers a novel addition to the capabilities of phase field models for recrystallization simulation.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temporal and Topological Partitioning of a Large-Scale Real-World Network: Scale-Free Properties and Minimal Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale, real-world growing network connecting software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network comprises approximately 6 billion nodes and edges and spans more than 40 years of growth. Our analysis leverages natural partitions of nodes and edges, based on both temporal and topological attributes.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a global bow-tie-like structure and enables a preliminary investigation of edge dynamics (such as creation, inheritance, and aging) alongside comparisons with minimal models. We analyze degree distributions over time, edge timestamp histograms, and estimates of the in-degree distribution's scaling exponent. The results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and to the presence of numerous outliers, while showing that the proposed partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  Node types derived from topological and temporal partitions reveal regime shifts associated with changes in developer practices, notably variations in the average number of new edges per new node over time. These structural and dynamical transitions hinder definitive conclusions regarding the existence and observability of a scale-free regime, and underscore the need for advanced tools to study transient growth phases and to facilitate robust comparisons between real-world evolving networks and minimal models.</description>

Abstract: Simulating complex physical systems is crucial for understanding and predicting phenomena across diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics and heat transfer, as well as plasma physics and structural mechanics. Traditional approaches rely on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using numerical methods, which are computationally expensive and often prohibitively slow for real-time applications or large-scale simulations. Neural PDEs have emerged as efficient alternatives to these costly numerical solvers, offering significant computational speed-ups. However, their lack of robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) limits deployment in critical applications. We introduce a model-agnostic, physics-informed conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides guaranteed uncertainty estimates without requiring labelled data. By utilising a physics-based approach, we can quantify and calibrate the model's inconsistencies with the physics rather than the uncertainty arising from the data. Our approach utilises convolutional layers as finite-difference stencils and leverages physics residual errors as nonconformity scores, enabling data-free UQ with marginal and joint coverage guarantees across prediction domains for a range of complex PDEs. We further validate the efficacy of our method on neural PDE models for plasma modelling and shot design in fusion reactors.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs), including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2) LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.</description>
