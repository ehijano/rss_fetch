      <title>Development of Low-Noise Two-stage dc-SQUID for TES Detector Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19565v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUIDs) are one of the most sensitive magnetic detectors. These sensors are extensively used in the readout of superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs), which are used for the detection of weak signals. A cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization telescope operating in 22-48 GHz is currently under developing. The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells. This configuration has been shown to achieve extremely high signal gain while effectively controlling system noise. We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ ${\mu}\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$. The current noise equivalent to the input coil of input SQUID is about $2.4$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. This result meets the low-noise readout requirements of the CMB TES and other applications with TES detectors.</description>

      <title>Development of Electroformed X-ray Optics Bridging Synchrotron Technology and Space Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed X-ray telescope mirrors using an original electroforming replication technique established through the fabrication of millimeter-aperture, ultra-short-focal-length nanofocusing mirrors for synchrotron X-ray microscopy. This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats.</description>

      <title>First observation of the $\gamma$-ray beam production by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light emitted from an undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compton scattering of photons off high-energy electrons is a fundamental quantum mechanical process widely utilized to produce a $\gamma$-ray beam for scientific research. Instead of injecting laser light into a storage ring as a conventional way, we have developed an innovative method to achieve drastically higher energies approaching the ring energy by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. In this method, $92$ $\mathrm{eV}$ photons obtained from an undulator in a storage ring were reflected back to the original ring using a Mo/Si multilayer mirror. Consequently, $\gamma$-ray beam production through the extreme ultraviolet light Compton scattering was observed for the first time in a demonstration experiment at the $1$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ ring, NewSUBARU. The measured energy spectrum was well reproduced by a theoretical calculation with the maximum energy of $0.543$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. The production rate was $1.4 \pm 0.1$ kcps for the energies above $0.160$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. This rate was quantitatively explained by the luminosity and the scattering cross section. The present work paved the way to create a new $\gamma$-ray beam source for future applications such as hadron photoproduction experiments.</description>

      <title>High-throughput Parasitic-independent Probe Thermal Resistance Calibration for Robust Thermal Mapping with Scanning Thermal Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructured materials, critical for thermal management in semiconductor devices, exhibit a strong size dependence in thermal transport. Studying thermal resistance variation across grain boundaries is critical for designing effective thermal interface materials. Frequency-domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR)-based techniques can provide thermal resistance mapping at the micrometer ({\mu}m) scale. Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) enables quantification of local thermal transport with significantly higher spatial resolution (&lt;100 nm). However, challenges in quantifying the raw signal to thermal conductivity and surface sensitivity limit its widespread adoption for understanding nanoscale heat transport and defect-mediated thermal properties in nanostructured films. Here, we introduce a circuit-based probe thermal resistance (R_p) calibration technique independent of parasitic heat pathways, enabling accurate determination of probe heat dissipation and tip temperature rise, thereby allowing extraction of local thermal resistance. SThM achieved sub-100 nm spatial resolution in mapping thermal resistance across a 15 nm-thick Al film deposited via e-beam evaporation on SiO_2 substrate. The thermal resistance maps are converted to thermal conductivity using robust analytical and finite element models that account for tip-sample geometry, lateral heat spreading, and buried interface effects. Gaussian distribution fitting of pixel-level thermal resistance values yields k_Al = 45.1(+4.7/-3.6) W/(m.K) for the ultra-thin Al film (13-15 nm), representing a 5.3-fold reduction from bulk aluminum (237 W/(m.K)). These results agree with published experimental data and theoretical frameworks explaining thickness-dependent heat transport in ultra-thin metallic films.</description>

      <title>Talking with a ghost: semi-virtual coupled levitated oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesoscopic particles levitated by optical, electrical or magnetic fields act as mechanical oscillators with a range of surprising properties, such as tuneable oscillation frequencies, access to rotational motion, and remarkable quality factors. Coupled levitated particles display rich dynamics and non-reciprocal interactions, with applications in sensing and the exploration of non-equilibrium and quantum physics. In this work, we present a single levitated particle displaying coupled-oscillator dynamics by generating an interaction with a virtual or ``ghost'' particle. This ghost levitated particle is simulated on an analogue computer, and its properties can thus be dynamically varied. Our work represents a new angle on measurement-based bath engineering and physical simulation and, in the future, could lead to the generation of novel cooling mechanisms and complex physical simulation.</description>
