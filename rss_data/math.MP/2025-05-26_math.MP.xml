      <title>Real Spectra in PT Symmetry Hamiltonians using Tridiagonal Representation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the solution of PT symmetry Hamiltonians using the technique of tridiagonal representation approach. This methodology provides more accurate results and proper depiction of the Hamiltonian energy level and wavefunctions. It is well know that PT symmetry condition of a Hamiltonian ensure that its spectra are real and positive even if the Hamiltonian is non Hermitian. Here, we introduce the method of TRA to get the eigenvalues and wavefunction of this Hamiltonian for integers values of $N$ and show an approximation solution for non-integer value of $N$. Due to the nature of the Hamiltonian, the TRA was applied in a semi-Analytic manner in the paper.</description>

      <title>Smooth critical points of eigenvalues on the torus of magnetic perturbations of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the nodal distribution universality conjecture for discrete operators on graphs and by the spectral analysis of their maximal abelian covers, we consider a family of Hermitian matrices $h_{\alpha}$ obtained by varying the complex phases of individual matrix elements. This family is parametrized by a $\beta$-dimensional torus, where $\beta$ is the first Betti number of the underlying graph. The eigenvalues of each matrix are ordered, enabling us to treat the $k$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_k$ as a function on the torus. We classify the smooth critical points of $\lambda_k$, describe their structure and Morse index in terms of the support and nodal count, that is, the number of sign changes between adjacent vertices of the corresponding eigenvector. In general, the families under consideration exhibit critical submanifolds rather than isolated critical points. These critical manifolds appear frequently and cannot be removed through perturbations. We provide an algorithmic way of determining all critical submanifolds by investigating finitely many eigenvalue problems: the $2^\beta$ real symmetric matrices $h_\alpha$ in the family under consideration as well as their principal minors.</description>

      <title>On the global Gaussian bending measure and its applications in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02195v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been suggested to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there lacks effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it can be applied to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory is applicable to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.</description>

      <title>Compound Burgers-KdV Soliton Behaviour: Refraction, Reflection and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a coupled PDE system between the Burgers equation and the KdV equation to model the interactions between `bore'-like structures and wave-like solitons in shallow water. Two derivations of the resulting Burgers-swept KdV system are presented, based on Lie group symmetry and reduced variational principles. Exact compound soliton solutions are obtained, and numerical simulations show that the Burgers and KdV momenta tend toward a balance at which the coupled system reduces to the integrable Gardner equation. The numerical simulations also reveal rich nonlinear solution behaviours that include refraction, reflection, and soliton fusion, before the balance is finally achieved.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere: derivation and structure-preserving simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the global model of thermal quasi-geostrophy on the sphere via asymptotic expansion of the thermal rotating shallow water equations. The model does not rely on the asymptotic expansion of the Coriolis force and extends the quasi-geostrophic model on the sphere by including an additional transported buoyancy field acting as a source term for the potential vorticity. We give its Hamiltonian description in terms of semidirect product Lie--Poisson brackets. The Hamiltonian formulation reveals the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws, Casimirs, parameterized by two arbitrary smooth functions. A structure-preserving discretization is provided based on Zeitlin's self-consistent matrix approximation for hydrodynamics. A Casimir-preserving time integrator is employed to numerically fully preserve the resulting finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson structure. Simulations reveal the formation of vorticity and buoyancy fronts, and large-scale structures in the buoyancy dynamics induced by the buoyancy-bathymetry interaction.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Mattis ordering theorem of electronic energy levels in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lieb-Mattis theorem orders the lowest-energy states of total spin $s$ of a system of $P$ interacting fermions. We generalize these predictions to fermionic mixtures of $P$ particles with more than $N=2$ spinor components/species in the thermodynamic limit $P\to\infty$. The lowest-energy state inside each permutation symmetry sector $h$, arising in the $P$-fold tensor product decomposition, is well approximated by a U$(N)$ coherent (quasi-classical, variational) state, specially in the limit $P\to\infty$. In particular, the ground state of the system belongs the most symmetric (dominant Young tableau $h_0$) configuration. We exemplify our construction with the $N=3$ level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, with a previous motivation on pairing correlations and U$(N)$-invariant quantum Hall ferromagnets. In the limit $P\to\infty$, each lowest-energy state within each permutation symmetry sector $h$ undergoes a quantum phase transition for a critical value $\lambda_c(h)$ of the exchange coupling constant $\lambda$, depending on $h$. This generalizes standard quantum phase transitions and their phase diagrams corresponding to the ground state belonging to the most symmetric sector $h_0$.</description>

      <title>Multiple chordal SLE(0) and classical Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems of type $(n, m)$ for positive integers $n$ and $m$ with $m \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, extending the construction of~\cite{ABKM20} beyond the previously studied case $n = 2m$.
  By applying integrals of motion associated with the Loewner evolution, we show that, in the $\mathbb{H}$-uniformization with the marked point $q = \infty$, the traces of type $(n, m)$ multiple chordal $\mathrm{SLE}(0)$ systems correspond to the real locus of real rational functions with $n$ real simple critical points, $m$ simple poles, and a pole of order $n - 2m + 1$ at infinity.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that, under a common capacity parametrization, the Loewner dynamics evolve according to the classical Calogero-Moser Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A pedagogical approach to the black hole information problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semiclassical depiction of gravity has provided many important results, such as particle creation effects in expanding universes and in spacetimes containing black holes. However, many questions remain open, most notably concerning the final product of the black hole evaporation process and the conservation of information. From a pedagogical perspective, we review the concepts that lead to this state of affairs, also known as the black hole information problem, and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. Stating the necessary conjectures and results that lead to the geometrical properties of black holes, we present the notion of black hole evaporation and the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory under the Hadamard condition. We then show that the formation and complete evaporation of a black hole leads to information loss. Comparing such a result to the main alternatives to this non-unitary dynamical evolution, we formulate the black hole information problem and show that information loss is a genuine prediction if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale.</description>

      <title>Lindblad evolution as gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a simple argument that, for a large class of jump operators, the Lindblad evolution can be written as a gradient flow in the space of density operators acting on a Hilbert space of dimension $D$. We give explicit expressions for the (matrix-valued) eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the Lindblad evolution using this formalism. We argue that in many cases the interpretation of the evolution is simplified by passing from the $D^2$-dimensional space of density operators to the $D^2-1$-dimensional space of Bloch vectors. When jump operators are non-Hermitian the evolution is not in general gradient flow, but we show that it nevertheless resembles gradient flow in two particular ways. Importantly, the steady states of Lindbladian evolution are still determined by the potential in all cases.</description>

      <title>The Manakov-Zakharov-Ward model as an integrable decoupling limit of the membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel decoupling limit of the membrane is proposed, leading to the $(1+2)$-dimensional classically integrable model originally introduced by Manakov, Zakharov, and Ward. This limit can be interpreted as either a non-relativistic or large-wrapping regime of a membrane propagating in a toy background of the form $\mathbb{R}_t \times T^2 \times G$, where $G$ is a Lie group and the geometry is supported by a four-form flux. We demonstrate that such toy backgrounds can arise from consistent eleven-dimensional supergravity solutions, exemplified by the uplift of the pure NSNS AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ T$^4$ background.</description>

      <title>On the nature of the black hole information problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to present the black hole information problem and discuss the assumptions and hypotheses necessary for its formulation. As the problem arises in the framework of semiclassical gravity, we first review the necessary notions to describe Lorentzian manifolds equipped with physical properties, as well as the physical concepts of the theory that describes the gravitational interaction as the curvature of spacetime, general relativity. From its classical perspective, we develop the formalism to study the dynamical aspects of black holes in spacetimes obeying suitable causality conditions. Equipped with conjectures that nature censors naked singularities and that black holes reach a stationary configuration after they form, the black hole uniqueness theorems allow us to review several relations for the geometrical quantities associated with them. Following considerations of the other fundamental interactions, which are described by quantum field theory, we review the arguments in the formalism of quantum field theory in curved spacetime that give rise to the effective particle creation effect, its approximately thermal character, and the concept of black hole evaporation. With a precise quantification of information in quantum mechanics and assuming that the condition for physically acceptable states is given by the Hadamard condition, we review the result that entanglement between causally complementary regions is an intrinsic feature of quantum field theory. As a consequence, we discuss how the formation and complete evaporation of black holes leads to information loss. Conscious that such a prediction follows if no deviations from the semiclassical picture occur at the Planck scale, we discuss alternatives to this nonunitary dynamical evolution and formulate the black hole information problem. Lastly, we analyze the assumptions and hypotheses that lead to the problem.</description>

      <title>Kostka Numbers Constrain Particle Exchange Statistics beyond Fermions and Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17361v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing theoretical explorations of intermediate statistics beyond bosons and fermions have followed three routes: (1) a statistical-mechanics route that modifies microstate counting rules; (2) a quantum-mechanics route that generalizes wavefunction exchange symmetry via group representations; and (3) a quantum-field-theory route that deforms the creation-annihilation algebra. While each route has advanced individually, a unified formulation remains elusive. Recently, consistency between routes (2) and (3) was demonstrated (Nature 637, 314 (2025)). Here, employing combinatorial arguments with Kostka numbers, we establish the microstate uniqueness theorem (MUT). It demonstrates that statistical-mechanics counting constraints (route 1) and symmetric-group-based quantum-mechanical exchange symmetry (a restricted subset of route 2, excluding braid-group generalizations) are mathematically incompatible under indistinguishability. Consequently, intermediate statistics based on higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group or on modified microstate-counting rules are mathematically ruled out for indistinguishable particles. The MUT relies solely on the indistinguishability principle, without invoking Lorentz symmetry or any field-theoretic assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of Cauchy data for the wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^1$ by the measurements of its solution on the boundary of the finite interval. This is a one-dimensional model for the multidimensional problem of photoacoustics, which was studied in \cite{BLMM}. We adapt and simplify the method for one-dimensional situation and provide the results on numerical testing to see the rate of convergence and stability of the procedure. We also give some hints on how the procedure of reconstruction can be simplified in 2d and 3d cases.</description>

      <title>Surface-Encoded Partial Coherence Transformation: Modeling Source Coherence Effects in Wave Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new mathematical framework for incorporating partial coherence effects into wave optics simulations through a comprehensive surface-to-detector approach. Unlike traditional ensemble averaging methods, our dual-component framework models partial coherence through: (1) a surface-encoded transformation implemented via a linear integral operator with a spatially-dependent kernel that modifies coherence properties at the reflection interface, followed by (2) a propagation component that evolves these coherence properties to the detection plane. This approach differs fundamentally from conventional models by explicitly separating surface interactions from propagation effects, while maintaining a unified mathematical structure. We derive the mathematical foundation based on the coherence function formalism, establish the connection to the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem, and prove the equivalence of our framework to conventional partial coherence theory. The method reduces the dimensional complexity of coherence calculations and offers potential computational advantages, particularly for systems involving multiple surfaces and propagation steps. Applications include optical testing and astronomical instrumentation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs, demonstrate the convergence properties, and analyze the relative importance of surface and propagation effects across different optical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We study the homogenization of the Thomas-Fermi-von Weizsacker (TFW) model for 2D materials. It consists in considering 2D-periodic nuclear densities with periods going to zero. We study the behavior of the corresponding ground state electronic densities and ground state energies. The main result is that these three dimensional problems converge to a limit model that is one dimensional. We also illustrate this convergence with numerical simulations and estimate the converging rate for the ground state electronic densities and the ground state energies.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Solutions of the Haydys-Witten Equations and Symplectic Khovanov Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An influential conjecture by Witten states that there is an instanton Floer homology of four-manifolds with corners that in certain situations is isomorphic to Khovanov homology of a given knot $K$. The Floer chain complex is generated by Nahm pole solutions of the Kapustin-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$ with an additional monopole-like singular behaviour along the knot $K$ inside the three-dimensional boundary at $y=0$. The Floer differential is given by counting solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between Kapustin-Witten solutions along an additional flow direction $\mathbb{R}_s$. This article investigates solutions of a decoupled version of the Kapustin-Witten and Haydys-Witten equations on $\mathbb{R}_s \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+_y$, which in contrast to the full equations exhibit a Hermitian Yang-Mills structure and can be viewed as a lift of the extended Bogomolny equations (EBE) from three to five dimensions. Inspired by Gaiotto-Witten's approach of adiabatically braiding EBE-solutions to obtain generators of the Floer homology, we propose that there is an equivalence between adiabatic solutions of the decoupled Haydys-Witten equations and non-vertical paths in the moduli space of EBE-solutions fibered over the space of monopole positions. Moreover, we argue that the Grothendieck-Springer resolution of the Lie algebra of the gauge group provides a finite-dimensional model of this moduli space of monopole solutions. These considerations suggest an intriguing similarity between Haydys-Witten instanton Floer homology and symplectic Khovanov homology and provide a novel approach towards a proof of Witten's gauge-theoretic interpretations of Khovanov homology.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization of $\lambda \phi_2^4$- theory in 2-d Moyal space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the conjecture that the $\lambda \phi^4$ QFT- model on 4-dimensional non-commutative Moyal space can be non-perturbatively constructed. As preparation, in this paper we construct the 2-dimensional case with the method of stochastic quantization. We show the local well-posedness and global well-posedness of the stochastic quantization equation, leading to a construction of the Moyal $\lambda \phi^4_2$ measure for any non-negative coupling constant $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, we identify the scaling conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. We then use large deviations theory to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this deterministic behavior, which we show preserves the fluctuation theorem. For many systems (e.g. chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, Potts models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches (obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics) which, if used, are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum, the free energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasi-potential (or self-information) which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics. Remarkably, thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential, thus constraining the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, we derive a nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics. Finally, we coarse grain the macroscopic stochastic dynamics into a Markov jump process describing transitions among deterministic attractors and formulate the stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze geometric aspects of the gradient descent algorithm in Deep Learning (DL), and give a detailed discussion of the circumstance that in underparametrized DL networks, zero loss minimization can generically not be attained. As a consequence, we conclude that the distribution of training inputs must necessarily be non-generic in order to produce zero loss minimizers, both for the method constructed in [Chen-Munoz Ewald 2023, 2024], or for gradient descent [Chen 2025] (which assume clustering of training data).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17578v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we prove that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds for $A$. We further construct a semidirect product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, and establish a correspondence between equivariant sheaves on the representation space and left $A\rtimes\mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, using the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations of a preprojective algebra and those of a quiver variety.</description>

      <title>Fiber bundle structure in Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12927v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to provide a rigorous geometric framework for the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity. As the starting point of this formulation consists in recasting General Relativity as an SU(2) gauge theory, it naturally lends itself to interpretation within the theory of principal bundles. The foundation of our framework is the spin structure, which connects the principal SU(2)-bundle construction with the Riemannian framework. The existence of the spin structure enlightens the geometric properties of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection and the topological characteristics of the manifold. Within this framework, we are able to express the constraints of the physical theory in a coordinate-free way, using vector-valued forms that acquire a clear geometric interpretation.
  Using these geometric concepts, we analyze the phase space of the theory and discuss the implementation of symmetries through the automorphism group of the principal SU(2)-bundle. In particular, we demonstrate that the description of the kinematical constraints as vector-valued forms provides a natural implementation as momentum maps for the automorphism group action.</description>

      <title>New Uncertainty Principle for a particle on a Torus Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work deals with quantum Uncertainty Relations (UR) subjected to the Standard Deviations (SD) of the relevant dynamical variables for a particle constrained to move on a torus knot. It is important to note that these variables have to obey the two distinct periodicities of the knotted paths embedded on the torus. We compute generalized forms of the SDs and the subsequent URs (following the Kennard-Robertson formalism). These quantities explicitly involve the torus parameters and the knot parameters where restrictions on the latter have to be taken into account. These induce restrictions on the possible form of wave functions that are used to calculate the SDs and URs and in our simple example, two distinct SDs and URs are possible. In a certain limit (thin torus limit), our results will reduce to the results for a particle moving in a circle.
  An interesting fact emerges that in the case of the SDs and URs, the local geometry of the knots plays the decisive role and not their topological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma sheaths are inhomogeneous stationary states that form when a plasma is in contact with an absorbing wall. We prove linear and non linear stability of a kinetic sheath stationary state for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded interval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the fluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is smaller than the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we prove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized perturbation of the equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11896v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geodesics of Kerr's metric are described by the four-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics integrable in the Arnold--Liouville sense. It can be reduced to two-dimensional one by the use of Fermat's principle. The resulting Hamiltonian is, however, rather complicated. We show how one can apply the coupling constant metamorphosis to simplify the Hamiltonian to the one quadratic in momenta and depending on the initial "energy" as parameter. It describes a simple dynamics of two non-linear oscillators and can be integrated directly or evaluated in the framework of perturbation theory by adopting the elegant Lindstedt--Poincar\'e algorithm. The idea of coupling constant metamorphosis is also applied to the Myers--Perry metric -- a five dimensional generalization of Kerr's metric. The case of single rotation parameter is considered in some detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate it in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

Abstract: In this work we establish every spherically symmetric non-Abelian Z(2) monopole generated by su(2) embeddings in the SU(4) Yang-Mills-Higgs model minimally broken to SO(4) by a symmetric second-rank tensor Higgs field. We find new monopole solutions associated with index 4 and index 10 embeddings. These solutions belong to su(2) multiplets that are higher dimensional than triplets. Properties of these monopoles such as their mass and radius are calculated in the vanishing potential limit. A parallel between this result and the Standard Model hierarchy of fermion masses is considered.</description>

      <title>High-spin measurements in an arbitrary two-qudit state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality by a bipartite quantum state is now used in many quantum applications. However, the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements is still known only for $s=1/2$. In the present article, for an arbitrary state of two spin-$s$ qudits, each of dimension $d=2s+1\geq 2$, we introduce the notion of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix, which has dimension $3\times 3$ for all $s\geq \frac{1}{2}$; establish its relation to the general correlation $(d^{2}-1)\times (d^{2}-1)$ matrix of this state within the generalized Pauli representation and derive in terms of the spin-$s$ correlation matrix the explicit analytical expression for the maximal value of the CHSH expectation under local Alice and Bob spin-$s$ measurements in this state. Specifying this general expression for the two-qudit GHZ state, the nonlocal two-qudit Werner state, and some nonseparable pure two-qudit states, we find that, under local Alice and Bob high-spin ($s\geq1$) measurements in each of these nonseparable states, including the maximally entangled one, the CHSH inequality is not violated. Moreover, unlike the case of spin-$1/2$ measurements, where each pure nonseparable two-qubit state violates the CHSH inequality and the maximal value of its CHSH expectation increases monotonically with a growth of its entanglement, the situation under high-spin measurements is quite different -- for a pure two-qudit state with a higher degree of entanglement, the maximal value of the CHSH expectation turns out to be less than for a pure two-qudit state with lower entanglement and even for a separable one.</description>

      <title>Mixed Berndt-Type Integrals and Generalized Barnes Multiple Zeta Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study four families of Berndt-type integrals, called mixed Berndt-type integrals, which contains (hyperbolic) sine and cosine functions in the integrand function. By contour integration, these integrals are first converted to some hyperbolic (infinite) sums of Ramanujan type, all of which can be calculated in closed forms by comparing both the Fourier series expansions and the Maclaurin series expansions of a few Jacobi elliptic functions. These sums can be expressed as rational polynomials of {\Gamma}(1/4) and {\pi}^{-1} which give rise to the closed formulas of the mixed Berndt-type integrals we are interested in. Moreover, we also present some interesting consequences and illustrative examples. Further, we define a generalized Barnes multiple zeta function, and find a classic integral representation of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Furthermore, we give an alternative evaluation of the mixed Berndt-type integrals in terms of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function. Finally, we obtain some direct evaluations of rational linear combinations of the generalized Barnes multiple zeta function.</description>
