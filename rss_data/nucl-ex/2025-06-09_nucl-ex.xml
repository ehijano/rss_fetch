      <title>Model Comparisons of Transverse Energy and Charged-Particle Multiplicity in A+A Collisions at Midrapidity from $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $=$ 7.7 to 200~GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparison of PHENIX measurements of transverse energy production ($dE_T/d\eta$) and charged-particle multiplicity ($dN/d\eta$) at midrapidity to simulations from PYTHIA-8, AMPT, HIJING, and SMASH. These comparisons span both small systems (d+Au, $^3$He+Au) and large systems (Cu+Cu, Cu+Au, Au+Au, and U+U) at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $\sim$ 200~GeV and Au+Au over a range of beam energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$--200~GeV. Using the Rivet framework, we assess the performance of these models. While general trends are captured, significant deviations persist, particularly in low-energy and peripheral collisions, underscoring the need for improved modeling of baryon stopping and energy deposition mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Universal Mass Equation for Equal-Quantum Excited-States Sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our recent study of the universal mass equation for equal-quantum excited-states sets reported by Roper and Strakovsky~\cite{Roper:2024ovj}. The masses of twelve baryon sets and sixteen meson sets, with only two equal-quantum excited states in each set, using Breit-Wigner PDG2024 masses and their uncertainties at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons, are fitted by a simple one-parameter logarithmic function, $M_n = \alpha Ln(n) + M_1$, where $n$ is the level of radial excitation. Two accurate masses that start a set are used to calculate four higher masses in the set accurately. It is noted that $\alpha$ values for $b\bar{b}$ equal-quantum excited-states sets accurately lie on a straight line, whose line parameters can be used to calculate $\alpha$ and predict higher mass states for $b\bar{b}$ sets that have only one known member.</description>

      <title>Removal of spallation-induced tritium from silicon through diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tritium, predominantly produced through spallation reactions caused by cosmic ray interactions, is a significant radioactive background for silicon-based rare event detection experiments, such as dark matter searches. We have investigated the feasibility of removing cosmogenic tritium from high-purity silicon intended for use in low-background experiments. We demonstrate that significant tritium removal is possible through diffusion by subjecting silicon to high-temperature (&gt; 400C) baking. Using an analytical model for the de-trapping and diffusion of tritium in silicon, our measurements indicate that cosmogenic tritium diffusion constants are comparable to previous measurements of thermally-introduced tritium, with complete de-trapping and removal achievable above 750C. This approach has the potential to alleviate the stringent constraints of cosmic ray exposure prior to device fabrication and significantly reduce the cosmogenic tritium backgrounds of silicon-based detectors for next-generation rare event searches.</description>

      <title>New Types of Hydrogenlike matter Composed of Electron(s) and Meson(s)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we predict the existence of new types of hydrogenlike matter, including hydrogenlike atoms ($\pi^+e^-$, $K^+e^-$, $D^+e^-$), hydrogenlike molecular ions ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-$) and hydrogenlike molecules ($\pi^+\pi^+e^-e^-$, $K^+K^+e^-e^-$, $D^+D^+e^-e^-$). By solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the binding energy of hydrogenlike atoms is obtained as $E_n=-\frac{1}{2n^2}$. For hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, the variational method is employed to calculate the binding energies, i.e., $E_+=-0.587$ and $E_0=-1.139$ for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules, respectively. And the bond lengths for hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules are also calculated, whose values are $2.003$ and $1.414$, respectively. Here all the quantities are in atomic unit for convenience. In additon, the strong interaction between the two constituent mesons is considered in our calculations, where we find that its influence on the hydrogenlike molecular ions and molecules can be neglected. Hopefully, these types of matter would be observed in the future with the improvement of accuracy in the high energy physical experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards a Global Search for New Physics with Isotope Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotope shifts have emerged as a sensitive probe of new bosons that couple to electrons and neutrons, and of nuclear structure. The recent Hz- or even sub-Hz-level isotope shift measurements across different elements call for a global assessment of all available data. In this work, we present the fit framework kifit that for the first time enables a combined analysis of isotope shift data from several elements, taking into account correlations. We provide a thorough comparison of analytical methods and the fit to analyse linear and nonlinear King plots and quantify their uncertainties. Finally, we provide recommendations for future measurements that could enhance the sensitivity to new physics and offer new insights into nuclear structure.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Evolution of Nuclear Excitation at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of nuclear excitation in electron-nucleus (e+A) collisions at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using the BeAGLE event generator. Leveraging the EIC's unique collider kinematics, we demonstrate the remarkable capability to separate distinct nuclear reaction stages, hard scattering, intranuclear cascade, and nuclear de-excitation, in the laboratory frame. Our systematic analysis reveals that event-by-event fluctuations in the mean transverse momentum (k) are highly sensitive to the intranuclear cascade formation time and nuclear geometry, while minimally affected by variations in electron beam energy. These findings establish k as a robust observable for constraining nuclear excitation mechanisms, providing critical benchmarks for future EIC experiments and guiding theoretical advancements in nuclear transport modeling.</description>

      <title>Angular differential and elemental fragmentation cross sections of a $400\,\text{MeV/nucleon}$ $^{16}\text{O}$ beam on a graphite target with the FOOT experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00553v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the measurements of the angular differential cross sections for the forward production of He, Li, Be, B, C and N nuclei in the fragmentation process of a 400$\text{MeV/nucleon}$ $^{16}\text{O}$ beam interacting with a graphite target. Due to the limited data available in this energy regime, these measurements of nuclear fragmentation cross sections are relevant to improve nuclear interaction models for Particle Therapy and space radioprotection applications. The data analyzed in this paper were collected during a measurement campaign carried out at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research facility in Darmstadt (Germany) by the FOOT collaboration. The results are compared with similar results found in the literature and with a previous FOOT measurement of the same process, using the same setup, from a previous pilot run performed at GSI. The pilot run data, however, had limited statistics and only allowed for the measurement of elemental fragmentation cross sections integrated in the setup acceptance. This data set, with statistics more than 100 times larger compared to the data collected in the previous run, enabled the measurement of angular differential cross sections, fully exploiting the granularity of the FOOT $\Delta \text{E}$-TOF system. Furthermore, a better comprehension of the FOOT apparatus allowed to improve the analysis techniques, leading to a reduction in the final systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>NuPECC Long Range Plan 2024 for European Nuclear Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee ( NuPECC, http://nupecc.org/ ) hosted by the European Science Foundation represents today a large nuclear physics community from 23 countries, 3 ESFRI (European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures) nuclear physics infrastructures and ECT* (European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas), as well as from 4 associated members and 10 observers.
  As stated in the NuPECC Terms of Reference one of the major objectives of the Committee is: "on a regular basis, the Committee shall organise a consultation of the community leading to the definition and publication of a Long Range Plan (LRP) of European nuclear physics". To this end, NuPECC has in the past produced five LRPs: in November 1991, December 1997, April 2004, December 2010, and November 2017.
  The LRP, being the unique document covering the whole nuclear physics landscape in Europe, identifies opportunities and priorities for nuclear science in Europe and provides national funding agencies, ESFRI, and the European Commission with a framework for coordinated advances in nuclear science. It serves also as a reference document for the strategic plans for nuclear physics in the European countries.</description>

      <title>Development and Benchmarking of JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experiments measuring fission observables encounter false coincidences arising from timing overlap of separate fission product decays. Simulations of both fission observables and particles in detector systems exist, but have not yet been combined to produce accurate event-by-event outputs in a time-dependent manner. Geant4 is a powerful simulation tool for nuclear physics studies, but it does not handle multiple initial particles in a single simulation instance, nor does it feature high fidelity fission sampling. JANGOFETT: A Novel Geant4-Operated Fission Event Tracking Tool has been developed to address this challenge. The tool utilizes simulated fission data from an external program in conjunction with Geant4, which has been modified to produce a single timeline of events over an entire simulated experiment. The physical accuracy of the simulated overlapping energy depositions within detectors has been verified via simulation of fission products from the spontaneous fission of 252Cf.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Response to Electrons and Pions in the Scintillating Fiber and Lead Calorimeter for the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of the Baby Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Baby BCAL) - a small-scale lead-scintillating-fiber (Pb/ScFi) prototype of the GlueX Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BCAL) - was tested in a dedicated beam campaign at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF). This study provides a benchmark for the Pb/ScFi component of the future Barrel Imaging Calorimeter (BIC) in the ePIC detector at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The detector response to electrons and pions was studied at beam energies between 4 and 10 GeV, extending previous GlueX tests [NIM A 596 (2008) 327-337 and arXiv:1801.03088] to a higher energy regime.
  The calibrated detector exhibits good linearity within uncertainties, and its electron energy resolution meets EIC requirements. The data further constrain the constant term in the energy resolution to below 1.9%, improving upon previous constraints at lower energies. Simulations reproduce key features of the electron and pion data within the limitations of the collected dataset and the FTBF test environment. Electron-pion separation in the test beam setup was analyzed using multiple methods, incorporating varying degrees of beam-related effects. The inclusion of longitudinal shower profile information enhanced the separation performance, underscoring its relevance for the full-scale BIC in ePIC. These results provide essential benchmarks for the Pb/ScFi section of the future BIC, validating detector simulations and guiding optimization strategies for electron-pion discrimination.</description>

Abstract: Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.</description>
