      <title>Algebraic realisation of three fermion generations with $S_3$ family and unbroken gauge symmetry from $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on previous work, we extend an algebraic realisation of three fermion generations within the complex Clifford algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, by incorporating an unbroken $U(1)_{em}$ gauge symmetry. The algebra $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ is the multiplication algebra of the complexification of the Cayley-Dickson algebra of sedenions, $\mathbb{S}$. Previous work represented three generations of fermions with $SU(3)_C$ colour symmetry, permuted by an $S_3$ symmetry of order-three. However, it proved difficult to find a $U(1)$ generator that assigns the correct electric charge to all states. By generalising the embedding of the order-three $S_3$ automorphism of $\mathbb{S}$ into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, we include an $S_3$-invariant $U(1)$ that correctly assigns electric charge. First generation states are represented in terms of two even $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$ semi-spinors, obtained from two minimal left ideals, related to each other via the order-two $S_3$ symmetry. The remaining two generations are obtained by applying the $S_3$ symmetry of order-three to the first generation. In this model, the gauge symmetries, $SU(3)_C\times U(1)_{em}$, are $S_3$-invariant and preserve the semi-spinors. As a result of the generalised embedding of the $S_3$ automorphisms of $\mathbb{S}$ into $\mathbb{C}\ell(8)$, the three generations are linearly independent, in contrast to earlier work.</description>

      <title>The M2-M5 Mohawk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the near-brane back-reaction of M2 branes ending on M5 branes has a rich "spike structure" that is determined by partitioning the numbers of M2 branes that are terminating on groups of M5 branes. The near-brane limit of the metric describing these branes has an AdS$_3$ factor, implying the existence of a dual CFT. Each partition of the M2 and M5 charges among spikes gives rise to a different "mohawk" revealing a new layer of brane fractionation. We conjecture that all these mohawks are dual to ground states of near-brane-intersection CFT's. We show that the supergravity solutions describing these mohawks are part of the large families of AdS$_3$ $\times S^3 \times S^3$ solutions described in [arXiv:1312.5477]. We identify precisely which of these families are relevant to brane intersections and show that the AdS$_3$ invariance emerges from the self-similarity of the spikes.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for black hole interiors: non-isometries, quantum extremal surfaces, and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.</description>

      <title>Free field realizations for rank-one SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the associated vertex operator algebras for all $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories of rank one. We give a uniform presentation through free-field realizations, which turns out to be a particularly suitable framework for this task. The elementary building blocks of the construction are dictated by the low energy degrees of freedom on the Higgs branch, which are well understood for rank-one theories. We further analyze the interplay between Higgs and Coulomb data on the moduli space of vacua, which tightly constrain the overall structure of the free field realizations. Our results suggest a plausible bottom-up classification scheme for low-rank SCFTs incorporating vertex algebra techniques.</description>

      <title>Semifinite von Neumann algebras in gauge theory and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

      <title>One-point thermal conformal blocks from four-point conformal integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the thermal shadow formalism to study the conformal blocks decomposition in $D$-dimensional conformal field theory on $\mathbb{S}_{\beta}^{1} \times \mathbb{S}^{D-1}$, where the temperature is $T = \beta^{-1}$. It is demonstrated that both the 1-point thermal ($T\neq 0$) conformal blocks and the 4-point plane ($T=0$) conformal blocks are defined by the same 4-point conformal integral. It is shown that up to power prefactors the 1-point thermal conformal block is given by the fourth Appell function.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hawking's black hole area theorem provides a geometric realization of the second law of thermodynamics and constrains gravitational processes. In this work we explore a one-parameter extension of this constraint formulated in terms of the monotonicity properties of R\'enyi entropies. We focus on black hole mergers in asymptotically AdS space and determine new restrictions which these R\'enyi second laws impose on the final state. We evaluate the entropic inequalities starting from the thermodynamic ensembles description of black hole geometries, and find that for many situations they set more stringent bounds than those imposed by the area increase theorem.</description>

      <title>Mean field theory and holographic Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-relativistic field theory model for the Kondo lattice. The Fierz identity and the mean-field approximation transform our model into an Anderson-like model that is stabilized by a scalar-type s-d interaction term. Numerical minimization of the thermodynamic potential shows that the Kondo condensation forms when the temperature is low, and the s-d coupling is strong. The formation of the Kondo condensation at zero temperature turns out to give a first-order quantum phase transition. Though these results are very suggestive and consistent with previous large-N studies, they work only when the mean-field theory is justified in strong coupling, as usual. We build a holographic model as an effective mean-field theory for the Kondo lattice with strong coupling, by considering interacting two-flavor spinors, one in standard quantization and the other one in the mixed quantization, both them coupled with scalar orders representing the Kondo condensation. Our model realizes the extended Fermi surface as well as the large fermion mass of heavy fermion physics in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Towards a warm holographic equation of state by an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model is employed to map state-of-the-art lattice QCD thermodynamics data from the temperature ($T$) axis towards the baryon-chemical potential ($\mu_B$) axis aimed at gaining a warm equation of state (EoS) of deconfined QCD matter which can be supplemented with a cool and confined part suitable for subsequent compact (neutron) star (merger) investigations. The model exhibits a critical end point (CEP) at $T_\mathrm{CEP} = \mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV and $\mu_{B \, \mathrm{CEP}} = 500 \ldots 700$ MeV with emerging first-order phase transition (FOPT) curve which extends to large values of $\mu_B$ without approaching the $\mu_B$ axis. We consider the impact and peculiarities of the related phase structure on the EoS for the employed dilaton potential and dynamical coupling parameterizations. These seem to prevent to design an overall trustable EoS without recourse to hybrid constructions.</description>

      <title>4D Chern-Simons theory with auxiliary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The auxiliary field sigma model (AFSM) has recently been constructed by Ferko and Smith as deformations of the principal chiral model by including auxiliary fields and the potential term given by an arbitrary univariate function. This AFSM provides an infinite family of integrable sigma models including the original $T\overline{T}$-deformation and the root $T\overline{T}$-deformation. In this paper, we propose a 4D Chern-Simons (CS) theory with auxiliary fields. Then the AFSM is derived from this CS theory with the twist function for the principal chiral model by imposing appropriate boundary conditions for the gauge field and auxiliary fields. We also derive the AFSM with the Wess-Zumino term by deforming the twist function and modifying the boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>All-loop heavy-heavy-light-light correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Heavy-Heavy-Light-Light (HHLL) correlators $\langle \mathcal{H} \mathcal{H} \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{O}_2 \rangle$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with $SU(N)$ gauge group at generic $N$. The light operator $\mathcal{O}_2$ is the dimension two superconformal primary in the stress tensor multiplet and $\mathcal{H}$ is a general half-BPS superconformal primary operator with dimension (or $R$-charge) $\Delta_{\mathcal{H}}$. We consider the large-charge 't Hooft limit, where $\Delta_{\mathcal{H}} \rightarrow \infty$ with fixed 't Hooft-like coupling $\lambda:=\Delta_{\mathcal{H}}\, g_{_{\rm YM}}^2$. We show that the $L$-loop contribution to the HHLL correlators in the leading large-charge limit is universal for any choice of the heavy operator $\mathcal{H}$, given as $\lambda^L \sum_{\ell=0}^{L} \Phi^{(\ell)} \Phi^{(L-\ell)}$ with an $SU(N)$ colour factor coefficient, where $\Phi^{(\ell)}$ is the ladder Feynman integral, which is known to all loops. The dependence on the explicit form of the heavy operator lies only in the colour factor coefficients. We determine such colour factors for several classes of heavy operators, and show that the large charge limit leads to minimal powers of $N$. For the special class of "canonical heavy operators", one can even resum the all-loop ladder integrals and determine the correlators at finite $\lambda$. Furthermore, upon integrating over the spacetime dependence, the resulting integrated HHLL correlators agree with the existing results derived from supersymmetric localisation. Finally, as an application of the all-loop analytic results, we derive exact expressions for the structure constants of two heavy operators and the Konishi operator, finding intriguing connections with the integrated HHLL correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bounds arising from the analyticity and unitarity of scattering amplitudes in the context of effective field theories with massless particles. We provide an approach that only uses dispersion relations away from the forward limit. This is suitable to derive constraints in the presence of gravity, in a way that is robust with respect to radiative corrections. Our method not only allows us to avoid the Coulomb pole, but also the singularities associated with calculable loop effects, which would otherwise diverge.</description>

      <title>Aspects of dS/CFT Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that a $dS_{d+1}$ spacetime of radius $R_{ds}$ has a holographic dual, living at future space-like infinity ${\cal I}^+$, with the bulk wave function being dual to the partition function of the boundary theory, [arXiv:astro-ph/0210603v5]. We consider some aspects of this correspondence. For under damped scalars with mass $M^2R_{ds}^2&gt;{d^2\over4}$, belonging to the principal series, we show that for the Bunch Davies vacuum a suitable source in the boundary theory can be identified in terms of the coherent state representation of the wave function. We argue that terms in the resulting correlation functions, which are independent of the late time cut-off, satisfy the Ward identities of a conformal field theory. We also discuss other ways to identify sources, both in the under damped and the over damped case, where $M^2R_{ds}^2&lt;{d^2\over4}$, and argue that these too can lead to correlators satisfying the Ward identities of a CFT. Some comments on the violation of reflection positivity, and the cut-off dependent terms, along with some explicit checks and sample calculations, are also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the unintegrated vertex operator at the first mass level of the open superstring from the OPE of massless vertices. Using BRST cohomology manipulations, the tree amplitude of two massless and one massive state is rewritten in terms of the pure spinor superspace kinematic expression of the massless four-point amplitude at the ${\alpha^\prime}^2$ level. A generalization relating the partial $n$-point tree amplitudes with one massive state and linear combinations of the ${\alpha^\prime}^2$ corrections to n+1 massless amplitudes is found and shown to be consistent with unitarity.</description>

      <title>Reflection and Transmission Amplitudes in a Digital Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how to measure in the setting of digital quantum simulations the reflection and transmission amplitudes of the one-dimensional scattering of a particle with a short-ranged potential. The main feature of the protocol is the coupling between the particle and an ancillary spin-1/2 degree of freedom. This allows us to reconstruct tomographically the scattering amplitudes, which are in general complex numbers, from the readout of one qubit. Applications of our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation in Top Anti-Top Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A top quark and an anti-top quark produced together at colliders have correlated spins. These spins constitute a quantum state that can exhibit entanglement and violate Bell's inequality. In realistic collider experiments, most analyses allow the axes, as well the Lorentz frame to vary event-by-event, thus introducing a dependence on the choice of event-dependent basis leading us to adopt "fictitious states," rather than genuine quantum states. The basis dependence of fictitious states allows for an optimization procedure, which makes the usage of fictitious states advantageous in measuring entanglement and Bell inequality violation. In this work, we show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for maximizing spin correlations, entanglement, and Bell inequality violation. We show that the optimal basis is approximately the same as the fixed beam basis (or the rotated beam basis) near the $t\bar t$ production threshold, while it approaches the helicity basis far above threshold. Using this basis, we present the sensitivity for entanglement and Bell inequality violation in $t\bar t$ events at the LHC and a future $e^+e^-$ collider. Since observing Bell inequality violation appears to be quite challenging experimentally, and requires a large dataset in collider experiments, choosing the optimal basis is crucially important to observe Bell inequality violation. Our method and general approach are equally applicable to other systems beyond $t \bar t$, including interactions beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Axion Relic Pockets -- a theory of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new theory of dark matter based on axion physics and cosmological phase transitions. We show that theories in which a gauge coupling increases through a first-order phase transition naturally result in `axion relic pockets': regions of relic false vacua stabilised by the pressure from a kinematically trapped, hot axion gas. Axion relic pockets provide a viable and highly economical theory of dark matter: the macroscopic properties of the pockets depend only on a single parameter (the phase transition temperature). We describe the formation, evolution and present-day properties of axion relic pockets, and outline how their phenomenology is distinct from existing dark matter paradigms. We briefly discuss how laboratory experiments and astronomical observations can be used to test the theory, and identify gamma-ray observations of magnetised, dark-matter-dense environments as particularly promising.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on quantum complexity of time-dependent oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum complexity, the introduction of a suitable geometrical space, based on the Lie group formed by fundamental operators, facilitates the identification of complexity through geodesic distance in the group manifold. Earlier work had shown that the computation of geodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic oscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an expansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for an upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian with time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar field on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as a function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble scales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de Sitter complexity. It provides a proof of concept for the application of Nielsen complexity in cosmology, together with a systematic setting in which higher-order terms can be included.</description>

      <title>Scattering amplitudes in the Randall-Sundrum model with brane-localized curvature terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the scattering amplitudes of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in Randall-Sundrum models with brane-localized curvature terms. We show that the presence of brane-localized curvature interactions modifies the properties of (4D) scalar fluctuations of the metric, resulting in scattering amplitudes of the massive spin-2 KK states which grow as ${\cal O}(s^3)$ instead of ${\cal O}(s)$. We uncover new constraints on the size of the brane-localized curvature interactions based on the consistency of the Sturm-Liouville mode systems of the spin-2 and spin-0 metric fluctuations. We connect the properties of the scattering amplitudes to the diffeomorphism invariance of the compactified KK theory with brane-localized curvature interactions. We verify that the scattering amplitudes involving brane-localized external sources (matter) are diffeomorphism-invariant, but show that those for matter localized at an arbitrary point in the bulk are not. We demonstrate that, in Feynman gauge, the spin-0 Goldstone bosons corresponding to helicity-0 states of the massive spin-2 KK bosons behave as a tower of Galileons, and that it is their interactions that produce the high-energy behavior of the scattering amplitudes. We also outline the correspondence between our results and those in the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model. In an appendix we discuss the analogous issue in extra-dimensional gauge theory, and show that the presence of a brane-localized gauge kinetic-energy term does not change the high-energy behavior of corresponding KK vector boson scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Localization beyond Dirac and Weyl fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, providing a natural generalization to the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-s. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions, scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and the magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for even (odd) s. Remarkably, we find the localization correction to scale exponentially with s, i.e., faster moving electrons are strongly susceptible to disorder effects. This opens up intriguing possibility for Anderson localization and many-body localization in these materials.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Glauber Phases in Non-Global LHC Observables for Large $N_c$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Glauber series for non-global jet observables at hadron colliders simultaneously includes the super-leading logarithms alongside an arbitrary number of Glauber phases. Building on the formalism of arXiv:2405.05305, it is shown that the leading terms in this series for large $N_c$ can be resummed in closed form in renormalization-group improved perturbation theory. This remarkable observation suggests that large-$N_c$ methods might also be helpful to study other aspects of non-global logarithms at hadron colliders, and to combine our analytic results with amplitude-level parton showers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how quantum geometrodynamics, a conservative approach to quantum gravity, might explain the emergence of classical spacetime and, with it, the emergence of classical time and its arrow from the universal quantum state. This follows from a particular but reasonable choice of boundary condition motivated by the structure of the Hamiltonian of the theory. This condition can also be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis' and the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum geometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to explain these observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) provides the most comprehensive characterization of bipartite entanglement in many-body quantum systems. Ground states of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are dominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium situations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field theories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this gap, we present an exact analytic result for the EH following a generic quantum quench in non-interacting fermionic models. This derivation adapts the celebrated quasiparticle picture to the EH, providing detailed insights into its physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation for engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the maximum classical energy density in fully charged quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries are anticipated to achieve significant advancements in energy storage capacity. In classical batteries, the energy density at each subsystem reaches its maximum value, denoted as $E_C$, which is determined by dividing the maximum energy by the number of subsystems. We demonstrate that this limit can be surpassed in quantum batteries by protocols of Quantum Energy Teleportaion (QET), allowing for the energy density at a subsystem to exceed the value of $E_C$. Our protocol offers enhanced efficiency, reduces experimental complexity on quantum computers, and enables instantaneous energy charging through Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC). Leveraging quantum entanglement, this protocol significantly improves quantum energy storage systems, promising advances in quantum computing and new technological applications. This work represents a crucial step towards revolutionizing quantum energy storage and transfer.</description>

      <title>Extended Uncertainty Principle: A Deeper Insight into the Hubble Tension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, known as the LambdaCDM model, has been successful in many respects, but it has some significant discrepancies, some of which have not been resolved yet. In measuring the Hubble-Lematre parameter, there is an apparent discrepancy which is known as the Hubble tension, defined as differences in values of this parameter measured by the Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) data (a model-independent method) and by the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation maps (a model-dependent method). Although many potential solutions have been proposed, the issue still remains unresolved. Recently, it was observed that the Hubble tension can be due to the concept of uncertainty in measuring cosmological parameters at large distance scales through applying the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP) in cosmological setups. Extending this pioneering idea, in the present study we plan to incorporate the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) containing a minimal fundamental measurable momentum (or equivalently, a maximal fundamental measurable length) as a candidate setup for describing large-scale effects of Quantum Gravity (QG) to address the Hubble tension and constrain the EUP length scale. In this regard, by finding a relevant formula for the effective photon rest mass in terms of the present-time value of the Hubble-Lematre parameter, we see that discrepancies in the value of photon rest mass associated with the Hubble-Lematre parameter values estimated from model-independent and model-dependent methods perhaps is the cause of Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Electroweak phase transition with the Standard Model effective field theory at finite temperature and finite density. Utilizing the dimensional reduction approach, we construct the tree dimensional thermal effective field theory at finite density and investigate the phase transition dynamics. We evaluate how the results depend on the renormalization scale and the chemical potential. Our results show that, with the tree dimensional thermal effective potential at 2-loop level, we can effectively reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the calculations of the phase transition parameters due to the renormalization scale dependence, and the new physics scale is restricted to be $\Lambda\lesssim (770-800)$ GeV by the baryon number washout avoidance condition. Meanwhile, the presence of the chemical potential would affect the phase transition parameter and make the constraints from the baryon number washout avoidance condition more strict, especially for weaker first-order phase transition scenarios at higher new physics scales.</description>

      <title>Teukolsky equation for near-extremal black holes beyond general relativity: near-horizon analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations on the near-horizon region of extremal and near-extremal rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein gravity. We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules the gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial equation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr except for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a detailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and find analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit. As an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr black holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain deformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we show lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the full modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right near-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study of quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative extensions of GR.</description>

      <title>Field Theories on Quantum Space-Times: Towards the Phenomenology of Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative geometry is a mathematical framework that expresses the structure of space-time in terms of operator algebras. By using the tools of quantum mechanics to describe the geometry, noncommutative space-times are expected to give rise to quantum gravity effects, at least in some regime. This manuscript focuses on the physical aspects of these so-called quantum space-times, in particular through the formalism of field and gauge theories. Scalar field theories are shown to possibly trigger mixed divergences in the infra-red and ultra-violet for the 2-point function at one loop. This phenomenon is generically called UV/IR mixing and stems from a diverging behaviour of the propagator. The analysis of such divergences differs from the commutative case because the momentum space is now also noncommutative. From another perspective, a gauge theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski, a quantum deformation of the Minkowski space-time, is derived. A first perturbative computation is shown to break the gauge invariance, a pathological behaviour common to other quantum space-times. A causality toy model is also developed on $\kappa$-Minkowski, in which an analogue of the speed-of-light limit emerges. The phenomenology of quantum gravity arising from quantum space-times is discussed, together with the actual constraints it imposes. Finally, a toy model for noncommutative gravity is tackled, using the former $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time to describe the tangent space. It necessitates the notion of noncommutative partition of unity specifically defined there.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes from Euclidean Correlators: Haag-Ruelle theory and approximation formulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a non-perturbative solution to the theoretical problem of extracting scattering amplitudes from Euclidean correlators in infinite volume. We work within the solid axiomatic framework of the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory and derive formulae which can be used to approximate scattering amplitudes arbitrarily well in terms of linear combinations of Euclidean correlators at discrete time separations. Our result generalizes and extends the range of applicability of a result previously obtained by Barata and Fredenhagen [Commun. Math. Phys. 138 (1991) 507-520]. We provide a concrete procedure to construct such approximations, making our formulae ready to be used in numerical calculations of non-perturbative QCD scattering amplitudes. A detailed numerical investigation is needed to assess whether the proposed strategy can lead to the calculation of scattering amplitudes with phenomenologically satisfactory precision with presently available lattice QCD data. This will be the subject of future work. Nevertheless, the numerical accuracy and precision of lattice simulations is systematically improvable, and we have little doubts that our approach will become useful in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian formalism, we compute the frequency-domain waveform generated by the gravitational scattering of two nonspinning bodies at the fourth post-Minkowskian order ($O(G^4)$, or two-loop order), and at the fractional second Post-Newtonian accuracy ($O(v^4/c^4)$). The waveform is decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics and the needed radiative multipoles, $U_{\ell m}(\omega), V_{\ell m}(\omega)$, are explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of master integrals. The basis of master integrals contains both (modified) Bessel functions, and solutions of inhomogeneous Bessel equations with Bessel-function sources. We show how to express the latter in terms of Meijer G functions. The low-frequency expansion of our results is checked againg existing classical soft theorems. We also complete our previous results on the $O(G^2)$ bremsstrahlung waveform by computing the $O(G^3)$ spectral densities of radiated energy and momentum, in the rest frame of one body, at the thirtieth order in velocity.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model Higgs potential is known to be metastable, therefore Higgs Inflation requires an extension in order to stabilise the potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$: $T$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, 2/3)$ and $B$ vector quarks transforming as $({\bf 3}, {\bf 1}, -1/3)$. Requiring stability of the finite-temperature effective potential, and assuming $m_{t}$ equals its mean value, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The corresponding absolute stability upper bounds are 4.4 TeV and 29 TeV. Small upper bounds are obtained for $B$ quarks. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger constraint on $m_{Q}$, with the $T$ quark upper bound equal to 2.4 TeV for $n_{Q} = 2$ and 13 TeV for $n_{Q} = 3$. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Topological defects of 2+1D systems from line excitations in 3+1D bulk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence of topological phases suggests strong connections between the topological features in a d+1-dimensional bulk and the potentially gapless theory on the (d-1)+1-dimensional boundary. In 2+1D topological phases, a direct correspondence can exist between anyonic excitations in the bulk and the topological point defects/primary fields in the boundary 1+1D conformal field theory. In this paper, we study how line excitations in 3+1D topological phases become line defects in the boundary 2+1D theory using the Topological Holography/Symmetry Topological Field Theory framework. We emphasize the importance of "descendent" line excitations and demonstrate in particular the effect of the Majorana chain defect: it leads to a distinct loop condensed gapped boundary state of the 3+1D fermionic Z2 topological order, and leaves signatures in the 2+1D Majorana-cone critical theory that describes the transition between the two types of loop condensed boundaries. Effects of non-invertible line excitations, such as Cheshire strings, are also discussed in bosonic 3+1D topological phases and the corresponding 2+1D critical points.</description>

      <title>Modern Tensor-Spinor Symbolic Algebra Algorithms and Computing Non-Closure Geometry &amp; Holoraumy in 11D, N = 1 Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Supersymmetry Genomics project aims to classify supermultiplets by properties like adinkras and holoraumy. The project's protocol is: 1) set up the SUSY transformation rules (and action) with unknown numerical coefficients, 2) solve those coefficients, and 3) compute desired properties, e.g., non-closure geometry (the non-closure functions in the anticommutator of supercovariant derivatives) and holoraumy (the commutator of supercovariant derivatives). This paper provides the first broadly applicable computer algorithms for completing these computations, comprising a new Cadabra module we call ``SusyPy.'' We provide a significant extension of the available tensor-arithmetic/canonicalization to include spinor-indexed expressions and NW-SE convention, and we provide a new Fierz expansion algorithm for spinor-indexed expressions. On top of this new tensor-spinor symbolic algebra, we have built algorithms for solving for the coefficients of a multiplet and its action, and for computing holoraumy, for both off-shell and on-shell N = 1 multiplets of any dimension. We apply our tools to assimilate linearized 11D, N = 1 supergravity into the Genomics project. We demonstrate solving the 11D, N = 1 multiplet, as in Cremmer, Julia, and Scherk, in a few lines of code, and we provide a comprehensive picture of the multiplet's non-closure geometry. Further, we provide the first-ever computation of the holoraumy of 11D, N = 1 supergravity.</description>

      <title>Field Theory Equivalences as Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-classically equivalent field theories are related by a quasi-isomorphism between their underlying $L_\infty$-algebras, but such a quasi-isomorphism is not necessarily a homotopy transfer. We demonstrate that all quasi-isomorphisms can be lifted to spans of $L_\infty$-algebras in which the quasi-isomorphic $L_\infty$-algebras are obtained from a correspondence $L_\infty$-algebra by a homotopy transfer. Our construction is very useful: homotopy transfer is computationally tractable, and physically, it amounts to integrating out fields in a Feynman diagram expansion. Spans of $L_\infty$-algebras allow for a clean definition of quasi-isomorphisms of cyclic $L_\infty$-algebras. Furthermore, they appear naturally in many contexts within physics. As examples, we first consider scalar field theory with interaction vertices blown up in different ways. We then show that (non-Abelian) T-duality can be seen as a span of $L_\infty$-algebras, and we provide full details in the case of the principal chiral model. We also present the relevant span of $L_\infty$-algebras for the Penrose-Ward transform in the context of self-dual Yang-Mills theory and Bogomolny monopoles.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Arrow of Time in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that time's arrow is naturally induced by quantum mechanical evolution, whenever the systems have a very large number ${\cal N}$ of non-degenerate states and a Hamiltonian bounded from below. When ${\cal N}$ is finite, the arrow is imperfect, since evolution can resurrect past states. In the limit ${\cal N} \rightarrow \infty$ the arrow is fixed by the "tooth of time": the decay of excited states induced by {\it spontaneous emission} to the ground state, mediated by interactions and a large number of decay products which carry energy and information to infinity. This applies to individual isolated atoms, and does not require a coupling to a separate large heath bath.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we calculate matrix of modular transformations of the one-point toric conformal blocks in the Neveu-Schwarz sector of $N=1$ super Liouville field theory. For this purpose we use explicit expression for this matrix as integral of product of certain elements of fusion matrix. This integral is computed using the chain of integral identities for supersymmetric hyperbolic gamma functions derived by the degeneration of the integrals of parafermionic elliptic gamma functions.</description>

      <title>Computation of Quark Masses from String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical computation, based on neural network techniques, of the physical Yukawa couplings in a heterotic string theory compactification on a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold with non-standard embedding. The model belongs to a large class of heterotic line bundle models that have previously been identified and whose low-energy spectrum precisely matches that of the MSSM plus fields uncharged under the Standard Model group. The relevant quantities for the calculation, that is, the Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau metric, the Hermitian Yang-Mills bundle metrics and the harmonic bundle-valued forms, are all computed by training suitable neural networks. For illustration, we consider a one-parameter family in complex structure moduli space. The computation at each point along this locus takes about half a day on a single twelve-core CPU. Our results for the Yukawa couplings are estimated to be within 10\% of the expected analytic result. We find that the effect of the matter field normalisation can be significant and can contribute towards generating hierarchical couplings. We also demonstrate that a zeroth order, semi-analytic calculation, based on the Fubini-Study metric and its counterparts for the bundle metric and the bundle-valued forms, leads to roughly correct results, about 25\% away from the numerical ones. The method can be applied to other heterotic line bundle models and generalised to other constructions, including to F-theory models.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reference Frames from Top-Down Crossed Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All physical observations are made relative to a reference frame, which is a system in its own right. If the system of interest admits a group symmetry, the reference frame observing it must transform commensurately under the group to ensure the covariance of the combined system. We point out that the crossed product is a way to realize quantum reference frames from the bottom-up; adjoining a quantum reference frame and imposing constraints generates a crossed product algebra. We provide a top-down specification of crossed product algebras and show that one cannot obtain inequivalent quantum reference frames using this approach. As a remedy, we define an abstract algebra associated to the system and symmetry group built out of relational crossed product algebras associated with different choices of quantum reference frames. We term this object the G-framed algebra, and show how potentially inequivalent frames are realized within this object. We comment on this algebra's analog of the classical Gribov problem in gauge theory, its importance in gravity where we show that it is relevant for semiclassical de Sitter and potentially beyond the semiclassical limit, and its utility for understanding the frame-dependence of physical notions like observables, density states, and entropies.</description>

      <title>Note on higher-group structure in 6d self-dual gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze higher-group structure of a 6d model coupled with a self-dual 2-form gauge field. This model is defined from 6d axion-electrodynamics with a 1-form Chern-Weil(CW) symmetry gauged dynamically. The gauging leads to a Green-Schwarz-West-Sagnotti(GSWS) term, which gives rise to an anomaly through a GSWS transformation acting on the 2-form gauge field. We cancel this anomaly by gauging a 3-form CW symmetry in 6d axion-electrodynamics. We find out the global symmetries in the resultant model and derive the gauge invariant action in the presence of the background gauge fields. It is argued that a discrete 1-form symmetry is anomalous because turning on the associated background gauge field causes quantum inconsistency due to an operator-valued ambiguity. Higher-group structure in this model that is manifested as a Green-Schwarz-like transformation for CW background gauge fields is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the coupling of the gravity supermultiplet (graviton and gravitino) of minimal $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA following a constructive approach. Firstly, we use the master formulae that follows from considering the scaling behavior of the spinor variables under the little group. Secondly, we derive the 4-point couplings using BFCW. Then, we verify these results for the general 3-point interactions that can be derived using the KLT-type relations, i.e., they can be written as the square of the coupling of the gluons and gluinos. Finally, we consider SUGRA Compton effect for graviton-gravitino. For completeness, we present in the appendix the $\mathcal{N}=1$ Sugra lagrangian in the 2-component Weyl formalism, including the proofs of SUSY and gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Linear-T Resistivity from Spatially Random Vector Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Patel et.al introduced a higher dimensional version of the SYK model with random coupling in Yukawa interaction to find the linear-$T$ resistivity. We test the universality of the mechanism by replacing the scalar with vector field in various dimensions. We find that it works for vector as well as scalar interaction, although the details are very different. However, this mechanism for the linear-$T$ resistivity works only in $(2+1)$ dimension not in higher dimension independent of the interaction type. Based on these results, we explore the role of spatial random disorder and find a simple understanding how such random scattering converts the Fermi liquid to the strange metal by changing the behavior of the self-energies of involved boson and fermion.</description>

      <title>The minimally extended Varying Speed of Light (meVSL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.09274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though there have been the various varying speed of light (VSL) cosmology models, they remain out of the mainstream because of their possible violation of physics laws built into fundamental physics. In order to be the VSL as a viable theory, it should inherit the success of special relativity including Maxwell equations and thermodynamics at least. Thus, we adopt that the speed of light, $\tilde c$ varies for the cosmic time not for the local time, i.e., $\tilde c[z]$ where $z$ is the cosmological redshift. When one describes the background FLRW universe, one can define the constant-time hypersurface by using physical quantities such as temperature, density, and $\tilde c$. It is because they evolve in time, and the homogeneity of the Universe demands that they must equal at the equal cosmic time. The variation of $\tilde c$ accompanies the joint variations of all related physical constants in order to satisfy the Lorentz invariance, thermodynamics, and Bianchi identity. We call this VSL model as a "minimally extended VSL (meVSL)". We derive cosmological observables of meVSL and obtain the constraints on the variation of $\tilde c$ by using the current observations. Interestingly, $z$ and all geometrical distances except the luminosity distance of meVSL are the same as those of general relativity. However, the Hubble parameter of meVSL is rescaled as $H = (1+z)^{-b/4} H^{(\rm GR)}$ which might be used as a solution for the tension of the Hubble parameter measurements. In this manuscript, we provide the main effects of meVSL on various cosmological observations including BBN, CMB, SZE, BAO, SNe, GWs, H, SL, and $\Delta \alpha$.</description>

In doing so, we reduce the problem of finding spherically symmetric hyperbolic monopoles to a problem in representation theory. Additionally, we determine constraints on the structure groups of such monopoles. Using these results, we construct novel spherically symmetric $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$ hyperbolic monopoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the behaviour of a noncommutative harmonic oscillator in a time-dependent background, as previously investigated in [1]. Specifically, we examine the system when expressed in terms of commutative variables, utilizing a generalized form of the standard Bopp-shift relations recently introduced in [2]. We solved the time dependent system and obtained the analytical form of the eigenfunction using the method of Lewis invariants, which is associated with the Ermakov-Pinney equation, a non-linear differential equation. We then obtain exact analytical solution set for the Ermakov-Pinney equation. With these solutions in place, we move on to compute the dynamics of the energy expectation value analytically and explore their graphical representations for various solution sets of the Ermakov-Pinney equation, associated with a particular choice of quantum number. Finally, we determined the generalized form of the uncertainty equality relations among the operators for both commutative and noncommutative cases. Expectedly, our study is consistent with the findings in [1], specifically in a particular limit where the coordinate mapping relations reduce to the standard Bopp-shift relations.</description>

      <title>Realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in Galileon inflation and PBH overproduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the explicit realisation of the ultra-slow roll phase in the framework of the effective field theory of single-field Galileon inflation. The pulsar timing array (PTA) collaboration hints at the scalar-induced gravity waves (SIGW) from the early universe as an explanation for the origin of the observed signal, which, however, leads to an enhancement in the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum giving rise to the overproduction of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the setup under consideration, we examine the generation of SIGW consistent with PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) data, in addition to which we also consider the impact from QCD crossover at the nHz frequencies and address the PBH overproduction issue assuming linear approximations for the over-density without incorporating non-Gaussian effects from the comoving curvature perturbation. The framework is shown to give rise to SIGWs well consistent with the PTA signal with comfortable PBH abundance, $10^{-3} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} &lt; 1$, of near solar-mass black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flavor deconstruction refers to ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model where the gauge group is split into multiple factors under which fermions transform non-universally. We propose a mechanism for charging same-family fermions into different factors of a deconstructed gauge theory in a way that gauge anomalies are avoided. The mechanism relies in the inclusion of a strongly-coupled sector, responsible of both anomaly cancellation and the breaking of the non-universal gauge symmetry. As an application, we propose different flavor deconstructions of the Standard Model that, instead of complete families, uniquely identify specific third-family fermions. All these deconstructions allow for a new physics scale that can be as low as few TeV and provide an excellent starting point for the explanation of the Standard Model flavor hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Glue in hadrons at medium resolution and the QCD instanton vacuum</title>

Abstract: We discuss a general framework for the evaluation of the gluonic form factors in light hadrons at low momentum transfer, in the QCD instanton vacuum. At medium resolution of the order of the inverse mean instanton size, the glue is mostly localized in single or pair of pseudoparticles, and globally constrained by the fluctuations of their topological charges. These pseudoparticles trap light quarks, giving rise to emerging multiflavor 't Hooft interactions. We explicitly evaluate the gluonic scalar, pseudoscalar, energy-momentum tensor (EMT), and the leading C-odd and C-even three gluons hadronic form factors, at next to leading order (NLO) in the instanton density, including molecular clusters of like and unlike instantons. We use the results for the EMT to address the contribution of the gluons in Ji$^\prime$s mass and spin sum rules, at low resolution. When evolved, our results for the mass and spin composition of the nucleon, are shown to be in good agreement with the recently reported lattice results at higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed information flow through a wormhole in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter aims to advance unexplored properties of a new class of Closed Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity, reported in Universe 9, 467 (2023) and Eur.$\,$Phys.$\,$J.$\,$C 83, 626 (2023). Therein, it was shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of spacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of two-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially, due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time. This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for timelike paths that experience time reversal.</description>
