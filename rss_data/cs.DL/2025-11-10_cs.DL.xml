      <title>AI-Powered Citation Auditing: A Zero-Assumption Protocol for Systematic Reference Verification in Academic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic citation integrity faces persistent challenges, with research indicating 20% of citations contain errors and manual verification requiring months of expert time. This paper presents a novel AI-powered methodology for systematic, comprehensive reference auditing using agentic AI with tool-use capabilities. We develop a zero-assumption verification protocol that independently validates every reference against multiple academic databases (Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, CrossRef) without assuming any citation is correct. The methodology was validated across 30 academic documents (2,581 references) spanning undergraduate projects to doctoral theses and peer-reviewed publications. Results demonstrate 91.7% average verification rate on published PLOS papers, with successful detection of fabricated references, retracted articles, orphan citations, and predatory journals. Time efficiency improved dramatically: 90-minute audits for 916-reference doctoral theses versus months of manual review. The system achieved &lt;0.5% false positive rate while identifying critical issues manual review might miss. This work establishes the first validated AI-agent methodology for academic citation integrity, demonstrating practical applicability for supervisors, students, and institutional quality assurance.</description>

      <title>The Drain of Scientific Publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domination of scientific publishing in the Global North by major commercial publishers is harmful to science. We need the most powerful members of the research community, funders, governments and Universities, to lead the drive to re-communalise publishing to serve science not the market.</description>

      <title>The use of social media among library professionals and patrons: A review of literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focused on the utilization of social media by library professionals and library users. It provides an understanding of social media, the most popular social media platforms utilized in the libraries. It also mentions the reasons for the adoption of social media in libraries be it academic, public, school libraries and other types of libraries. This is a review paper on the use of social media among library professionals and patrons. The findings reveal the contributions of social media to the libraries. Social media makes things easy for library professionals and library users. It enables them to connect, create awareness to new information, disseminate information instantly, and helps to market the library resources and services. Therefore, it is recommended amongst others that the library management board should encourage the use of social media in libraries.</description>

      <title>Mapping Research Productivity of BRICS Countries with Special Reference to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): A Scientometric Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of research productivity on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) among the BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, using data retrieved from the Web of Science database for the period 1990 to 2019. A total of 50,036 records were analyzed to assess publication growth trends, authorship patterns, collaboration levels, and citation impact. The findings reveal a steady increase in CAD-related publications, with China emerging as the leading contributor, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa. English dominated as the primary language of communication, accounting for over 93% of publications. Authorship and collaboration analysis indicate a high degree of joint research, with 97.91% of studies being co-authored and a degree of collaboration of 0.98, underscoring the collective nature of scientific inquiry in this domain. The study validates the applicability of Lotkas Law for author productivity, Bradfords Law for journal distribution, and Zipfs Law for keyword frequency, while the Price Square Root Law was found inapplicable. The predominant publication format was journal articles (79.7%), and Kardiologiya (Russia) emerged as the most prolific journal. The results demonstrate significant growth in CAD research output and collaboration within BRICS, though notable disparities persist among member nations. The study recommends enhancing individual author productivity, expanding international collaboration, and supporting CAD research through strategic institutional and governmental initiatives. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, funding agencies, and the academic community to strengthen cardiovascular research capacity within developing economies.</description>

      <title>Generating CodeMeta through declarative mapping rules: An open-ended approach using ShExML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, software is one of the cornerstones when conducting research in several scientific fields which employ computer-based methodologies to answer new research questions. However, for these experiments to be completely reproducible, research software should comply with the FAIR principles, yet its metadata can be represented following different data models and spread across different locations. In order to bring some cohesion to the field, CodeMeta was proposed as a vocabulary to represent research software metadata in a unified and standardised manner. While existing tools can help users to generate CodeMeta files for some specific use cases, they fall short on flexibility and adaptability. Hence, in this work, I propose the use of declarative mapping rules to generate CodeMeta files, illustrated through the implementation of three crosswalks in ShExML which are then expanded and merged to cover the generation of CodeMeta files for two existing research software artefacts. Moreover, the outputs are validated using SHACL and ShEx and the whole generation workflow is automated requiring minimal user intervention upon a new version release. This work can, therefore, be used as an example upon which other developers can include a CodeMeta generation workflow in their repositories, facilitating the adoption of CodeMeta and, ultimately, increasing research software FAIRness.</description>
