      <title>Delivery of DART Impact Ejecta to Mars and Earth: Opportunity for Meteor Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's DART and ESA's Hera missions offer a unique opportunity to investigate the delivery of impact ejecta to other celestial bodies. We performed ejecta dynamical simulations using 3 million particles categorized into three size populations (10 cm, 0.5 cm, and 30 $\mu$m) and constrained by early post-impact LICIACube observations. The main simulation explored ejecta velocities ranging from 1 to 1,000 m/s, while a secondary simulation focused on faster ejecta with velocities from 1 to 2 km/s. We identified DART ejecta orbits compatible with the delivery of meteor-producing particles to Mars and Earth. Our results indicate the possibility of ejecta reaching the Mars Hill sphere in 13 years for launch velocities around 450 m/s, which is within the observed range. Some ejecta particles launched at 770 m/s could reach Mars's vicinity in 7 years. Faster ejecta resulted in a higher flux delivery towards Mars and particles impacting the Earth Hill sphere above 1.5 km/s. The delivery process is slightly sensitive to the initial observed cone range and driven by synodic periods. The launch locations for material delivery to Mars were predominantly northern the DART impact site, while they displayed a southwestern tendency for the Earth-Moon system. Larger particles exhibit a marginally greater likelihood of reaching Mars, while smaller particles favor delivery to Earth-Moon, although this effect is insignificant. To support observational campaigns for DART-created meteors, we provide comprehensive information on the encounter characteristics (orbital elements and radiants) and quantify the orbital decoherence degree of the released meteoroids.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Photometry from Multiple Sources to Mitigate Stellar Variability in Precise Radial Velocities: A Case Study of Kepler-21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis of Kepler-21, the brightest (V = 8.5) Kepler system with a known transiting exoplanet, Kepler-21 b. Kepler-21 b is a radius valley planet ($R = 1.6\pm 0.2 R_{\oplus}$) with an Earth-like composition (8.38$\pm$1.62 g/cc), though its mass and radius fall in the regime of possible "water worlds." We utilize new Keck/HIRES and WIYN/NEID radial velocity (RV) data in conjunction with Kepler and TESS photometry to perform a detailed study of activity mitigation between photometry and RVs. We additionally refine the system parameters, and we utilize Gaia astrometry to place constraints on a long-term RV trend. Our activity analysis affirms the quality of Kepler photometry for removing correlated noise from RVs, despite its temporal distance, though we reveal some cases where TESS may be superior. Using refined orbital parameters and updated composition curves, we rule out a ``water world" scenario for Kepler-21 b, and we identify a long period super-Jupiter planetary candidate, Kepler-21 (c).</description>

      <title>Characterizing the current systems in the Martian ionosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the solar wind interacts with the ionosphere of an unmagnetized planet, it induces currents that form an induced magnetosphere. These currents and their associated magnetic fields play a pivotal role in controlling the movement of charged particles, which is essential for understanding the escape of planetary ions. Unlike the well-documented magnetospheric current systems, the ionospheric current systems on unmagnetized planets remain less understood, which constrains the quantification of electrodynamic energy transfer from stars to these planets. Here, utilizing eight years of data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we investigate the global distribution of ionospheric currents on Mars. We have identified two distinct current systems in the ionosphere: one aligns with the solar wind electric field yet exhibits hemispheric asymmetry perpendicular to the electric field direction; the other corresponds to the flow pattern of annually-averaged neutral winds. We propose that these two current systems are driven by the solar wind and atmospheric neutral winds, respectively. Our findings reveal that Martian ionospheric dynamics are influenced by the neutral winds from below and the solar wind from above, highlighting the complex and intriguing nature of current systems on unmagnetized planets.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review on Cislunar Expansion and Space Domain Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cislunar region is crucial for expanding human presence in space in the forthcoming decades. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent and anticipated Earth-Moon missions, and ongoing space domain awareness initiatives. An introduction to the dynamics as well as periodic trajectories in the Cislunar realm is presented. Then, a review of modern Cislunar programs as well as smaller missions are compiled to provide insights into the key players pushing towards the Moon. Trends of Cislunar missions and practices are identified, including the identification of regions of interest, such as the South Pole and the Near-rectilinear halo orbit. Finally, a review of the current state and short-comings of space domain awareness (SDA) in the region is included, utilizing the regions of interest as focal points for required improvement. The SDA review is completed through the analysis of the Artemis 1 trajectory.</description>

      <title>The characterisation of water ice in debris discs: implications for JWST scattered light observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water ice plays a crucial role throughout the different stages of planetary evolution and is abundant in the Universe. However, its presence and nature in debris discs of exoplanetary systems are not yet strongly established observationally. In this study, we quantify and discuss the impact of ice parameters such as volume fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$, blow-out grain size, size distribution, and its phase on the observational appearance of debris discs, considering the diverse nature of these systems around stellar spectral types ranging from A to M. Our findings reveal that the prominent ice features at approximately 2.7 and 3.3\,$\mu$m depend on both the water ice fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$ and the scattering angle, with backscattering geometries yielding the most prominent signatures. When the phase function is considered and data are not background limited, strong forward and backward scattering (near edge-on discs) are expected to yield the strongest detections in images/spectra for A or F-type stars, while scattering angle matters less for later type stars. The Fresnel peak at 3.1\,$\mu$m serves as a viable discriminant for the transitional phase (crystalline/amorphous), while simultaneously constraining the water ice temperature. For JWST imaging, we find that the F356W and F444W filter combination is most effective for constraining the grain size distribution, while the F356W and F277W filter combination provides better constraints on the ice fraction ${\mathcal{F}}_{\rm ice}$ in debris discs. However, degeneracy between the grain size distribution and ice fraction when using photometric flux ratios means that obtaining robust constraints will likely require more than two filters, or spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>A framework for incorporating binding energy distribution in gas-ice astrochemical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most serious limitations of current astrochemical models with the rate equation (RE) approach is that only a single type of binding site is considered in grain surface chemistry, although laboratory and quantum chemical studies have found that surfaces contain various binding sites with different potential energy depths. When various sites exist, adsorbed species can be trapped in deep potential sites, increasing the resident time on the surface. On the other hand, adsorbed species can be populated in shallow sites, activating thermal hopping and thus two-body reactions even at low temperatures, where the thermal hopping from deeper sites is not activated. Such behavior cannot be described by the conventional RE approach. In this work, I present a framework for incorporating various binding sites (i.e., binding energy distribution) in gas-ice astrochemical models as an extension of the conventional RE approach. I propose a simple method to estimate the probability density function for the occupation of various sites by adsorbed species, assuming a quasi-steady state. By using thermal desorption and hopping rates weighted by the probability density functions, the effect of binding energy distribution is incorporated into the RE approach without increasing the number of ordinary differential equations to be solved. This method is found to be accurate and computationally efficient and enables us to consider binding energy distribution even for a large gas-ice chemical network, which contains hundreds of icy species. The impact of the binding energy distribution on interstellar ice composition is discussed quantitatively for the first time.</description>

      <title>The BANANA Project. VII. High Eccentricity Predicts Spin-Orbit Misalignment in Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degree of spin-orbit alignment in a population of binary stars can be determined from measurements of their orbital inclinations and rotational broadening of their spectral lines. Alignment in a face-on binary guarantees low rotational broadening, while alignment in an edge-on binary maximizes the rotational broadening. In contrast, if spin-orbit angles ($\psi$) are random, rotational broadening should not depend on orbital inclination. Using this technique, we investigated a sample of 2{,}727 astrometric binaries from Gaia DR3 with F-type primaries and orbital periods between 50 and 1000 days (separations 0.3--2.7~au). We found that $\psi$ is strongly associated with $e$, the orbital eccentricity. When $e&lt;0.15$, the mean spin-orbit angle is $\langle\psi\rangle = 6.9_{-4.1}^{+5.4}$\,degrees, while for $e&gt;0.7$, it rises to $\langle\psi\rangle = 46_{-24}^{+26}$\,degrees. These results suggest that some binaries are affected by processes during their formation or evolution that excite both orbital eccentricity and inclination.</description>

      <title>The possibility of panspermia in the deep cosmos by means of the planetary dust grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By obtaining the assumption that planetary dust particles can escape from the gravitational attraction of a planet, we consider the possibility for the dust grains to leave the star's system by means of the radiation pressure. By taking the typical dust parameters into account, we consider their dynamics and show that they can reach the deep cosmos, taking part in panspermia. It has been shown that, during $5$ billion years, the dust grains will reach $10^5$ stellar systems, and by taking the Drake equation into account, it has been shown that the whole galaxy will be full of planetary dust particles.</description>

      <title>Resolved ALMA observations of water in the inner astronomical units of the HL Tau disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The water molecule is a key ingredient in the formation of planetary systems, with the water snowline being a favourable location for the growth of massive planetary cores. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array data of the ringed protoplanetary disk orbiting the young star HL Tauri that show centrally peaked, bright emission arising from three distinct transitions of the main water isotopologue. The spatially and spectrally resolved water content probes gas in a thermal range down to the water sublimation temperature. Our analysis implies a stringent lower limit of 3.7 Earth oceans of water vapour available within the inner 17 astronomical units of the system. We show that our observations are limited to probing the water content in the atmosphere of the disk, due to the high dust column density and absorption, and indicate that the main water isotopologue is the best tracer to spatially resolve water vapour in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>V892 Tau: A tidally perturbed circumbinary disc in a triple stellar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V892 Tau is a young binary star surrounded by a circumbinary disc which show hints of interaction with the low-mass nearby star V892 Tau NE. The goal of this paper is to constrain the orbit of V892 Tau NE and to determine the resulting circumbinary disc dynamics. We present new ALMA observations of the V892 Tau circumbinary disc at a twice higher angular and spectral resolution. We model the data with V892 Tau as a triple system and perform a grid of hydrodynamical simulations testing several orbits of the companion. The simulation outputs are then post-processed to build synthetic maps that we compare to the observations. The 12CO emission of the disc shows clear non-Keplerian features such as spiral arms. When comparing the data with our synthetic observations, we interpret these features as ongoing interactions with the companion. Our simulations indicate that an eccentricity of 0.5 of the companion is needed to reproduce the observed disc extent and that a mutual inclination of approximately 60{\deg} with the inner binary reproduces the measured disc tilt. In order to explain most of the features of the circumbinary disc, we propose that V892 Tau NE follows a misaligned eccentric orbit, with an eccentricity between 0.2 and 0.5 and a mutual inclination between 30{\deg} and 60{\deg}. Such a misaligned companion suggests the disc is oscillating and precessing with time, stabilising in an intermediate plane with a non-zero mutual inclination with the inner binary. Given that orbital configuration, we show that the stability of future planets is compromised in the second half of the disc once the gas has dissipated.</description>

      <title>Theoretical evidence of H-He demixing under Jupiter and Saturn conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immiscibility of hydrogen-helium mixture under the temperature and pressure conditions of planetary interiors is crucial for understanding the structures of gas giant planets (e.g., Jupiter and Saturn). While the experimental probe at such extreme conditions is challenging, theoretical simulation is heavily relied in an effort to unravel the mixing behavior of hydrogen and helium. Here we develop a method via a machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics simulation to quantify the physical separation of hydrogen and helium under the conditions of planetary interiors. The immiscibility line achieved with the developed method yields substantially higher demixing temperatures at pressure above 1.5 Mbar than earlier theoretical data, but matches better to the experimental estimate. Our results suggest a possibility that H-He demixing takes place in a large fraction of the interior radii of Jupiter and Saturn, i.e., 27.5% in Jupiter and 48.3% in Saturn. This indication of an H-He immiscible layer hints at the formation of helium rain and offers a potential explanation for the decrease of helium in the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn.</description>

      <title>cortecs: A Python package for compressing opacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absorption and emission of light by exoplanet atmospheres encode details of atmospheric composition, temperature, and dynamics. Fundamentally, simulating these processes requires detailed knowledge of the opacity of gases within an atmosphere. When modeling broad wavelength ranges at high resolution, such opacity data, for even a single gas, can take up multiple gigabytes of system random-access memory (RAM). This aspect can be a limiting factor when considering the number of gases to include in a simulation, the sampling strategy used for inference, or even the architecture of the system used for calculations. Here, we present cortecs, a Python tool for compressing opacity data. cortecs provides flexible methods for fitting the temperature, pressure, and wavelength dependencies of opacity data and for evaluating the opacity with accelerated, GPU-friendly methods. The package is actively developed on GitHub (https://github.com/arjunsavel/cortecs), and it is available for download with pip and conda.</description>
