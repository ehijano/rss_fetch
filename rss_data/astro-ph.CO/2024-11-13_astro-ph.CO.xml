      <title>Cosmography from accurate mass modeling of the lens group SDSS J0100+1818: five sources at three different redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems where multiple sources at different redshifts are strongly lensed by the same deflector allow one to directly investigate the evolution of the angular diameter distances with redshift, and thus to learn about the geometry of the Universe. We present measurements of the values of the total matter density, $\Omega_m$, and of the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$, through a strong lensing analysis of SDSSJ0100+1818, a group-scale system at $z=0.581$ with five lensed sources, from $z=1.698$ to $4.95$. We use new MUSE data to securely measure the redshift of 65 sources, including the five multiply imaged background sources (lensed into a total of 18 multiple images) and 19 galaxies on the deflector plane (the brightest group galaxy, BGG, and 18 fainter members), all employed to build robust strong lensing models with the software GLEE. We measure $\Omega_m = 0.14^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$ in a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) model, and $\Omega_m = 0.19^{+0.17}_{-0.10}$ and $w=-1.27_{-0.48}^{+0.43}$ in a flat $w$CDM model. We quantify, through a multi-plane approach, the impact of different sources angularly close in projection on the inferred values of the cosmological parameters. We obtain consistent median values, with uncertainties for only $\Omega_m$ increasing by a factor of 1.5. We accurately measure a total mass of $(1.55 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{13}$ M$_\odot$ within 50 kpc and a stellar over total mass profile decreasing from $45.6^{+8.7}_{-8.3}\%$ at the BGG effective radius to $(6.6\pm 1.1)\%$ at $R\approx 77$ kpc. Our results confirm that SDSSJ0100+1818 is one of the most massive (lens) galaxies known at intermediate redshift and that group-scale systems that act as lenses for $\geq 3$ background sources at different redshifts enable to estimate the values of the cosmological parameters with an accuracy that is competitive with that obtained from lens galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat $\Lambda$CDM models where the cosmological constant varies between $\Lambda = 0$ and $10^5$ times the observed value, $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at $\sim$27% for $0.01 \lesssim \Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs} \lesssim 1$. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of $\Lambda$ is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as $\Lambda$ increases, falling below 5% only for $\Lambda&gt;100 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on $\Lambda$, the median posterior value of $\Lambda$ is $539 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Furthermore, the probability of observing $\Lambda\leq \Lambda_{\rm obs}$ is only $0.5\%$. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with $\Lambda&lt;0$, the indication is thus that $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than $\Lambda$ alone must vary within the ensemble.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Reformation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can arise in a wide range of scenarios, from inflation to first-order phase transitions. Light PBHs, such as those produced during preheating or at the GUT scale, could induce an early matter-dominated phase given a moderate initial abundance. During the early matter-domination, the growth of initial PBH density perturbations can trigger collapse on horizon scales, producing much heavier PBHs. While the remaining original PBHs evaporate and reheat the Universe, these massive reformed PBHs survive for an extended period of time, producing potentially observable signatures at the present. We study this PBH reformation scenario and show that those reformed PBHs can emit significant quantities of gamma rays detectable by the next generation of experiments. The rapid reheating after matter domination generates a coincident stochastic gravitational wave background, which could be within range of the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment. The PBH reformation scenario provides an intriguing possibility of decoupling the current PBH population and the initial formation mechanism from early Universe physics, while providing opportunities for observation through multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 3500 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and induced gravitational waves from logarithmic non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black hole (PBH) based on numerical relativity simulations and peak theory as well as the corresponding scalar induced gravitational wave (SIGW) signals in the presence of \emph{logarithmic non-Gaussianities} which has recently been confirmed in a wide class of inflation models. Through numerical calculations, we find certain parameter spaces of the critical thresholds for the type A PBH formation and reveal a maximum critical threshold value. We also find that there is a region where no PBH is produced from type II fluctuations contrary to a previous study. We then confirm that SIGW signals originated from the logarithmic non-Gaussianity are detectable in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna if PBHs account for whole dark matter. Finally, we discuss the SIGW interpretation of the nHz stochastic gravitational wave background reported by the recent pulsar timing array observations. We find that PBH overproduction is a serious problem for most of the parameter space, while this tension might still be alleviated in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Some Times in Standard Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model is sufficiently well constrained that precise estimates can be provided for the redshift of various physically defined times in the chronology of the Universe. For example, it is well known that matter-radiation equality, recombination and reionisation happen at redshifts of around 3000, 1000 and 10, respectively, and these can be specified more precisely by fitting to data. What is less well known are the times in years (and their uncertainties) for these and other epochs in the history of the Universe. Here we provide precise time determinations for six epochs in cosmological history within the standard model, using data from the Planck satellite. Our main results are illustrated in a figure.</description>

      <title>Detecting ultralight axions from multifrequency observations of neutral hydrogen intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of ultralight axions (ULAs) on the differential brightness temperature fluctuations of neutral hydrogen at the post-reionization stage. Unique structure suppression features under the influence of ULAs are studied from angular correlations of the neutral hydrogen signals observed at different frequencies. Moreover, ULAs can behave like dark energy or dark matter at different mass regimes, implying that the fraction of the ULA energy density would be correlated with the sum of neutrino masses and the parameters of the dark energy equation of state for dark matter and dark energy like ULAs, respectively. We have explored the parameter space for the ULA physics and possible degeneracies among dark energy, neutrinos, and ULAs using the theoretical angular correlation functions expected from future intensity mapping surveys.</description>

      <title>MUltiplexed Survey Telescope: Perspectives for Large-Scale Structure Cosmology in the Era of Stage-V Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07970v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST) is a 6.5-meter telescope under development. Dedicated to highly-multiplexed, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, MUST observes over 20,000 targets simultaneously using 6.2-mm pitch positioning robots within a ~5 deg2 field of view. MUST aims to carry out the first Stage-V spectroscopic survey in the 2030s to map the 3D Universe with over 100 million galaxies and quasars, spanning from the nearby Universe to redshift z~5.5, corresponding to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. To cover this extensive redshift range, we present an initial conceptual target selection algorithm for different types of galaxies, from local bright galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and emission line galaxies to high-redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 5.5) Lyman-break galaxies. Using Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that MUST can address fundamental questions in cosmology, including the nature of dark energy, test of gravity theories, and investigations into primordial physics. This is the first paper in the series of science white papers for MUST, with subsequent developments focusing on additional scientific cases such as galaxy and quasar evolution, Milky Way physics, and dynamic phenomena in the time-domain Universe.</description>

      <title>Large Field Polynomial Inflation in Palatini $f(R,\phi)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Phase Space of Binary Black Holes from Gravitational Wave Observations to Unveil its Formation History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources offer a valuable window to the physical processes that govern the formation of binary compact objects (BCOs). However, deciphering such information from GW data is substantially challenging due to the difficulty in mapping from the space of observation to the space of numerous theoretical models. We introduce the concept of BCO Phase-Space that connects the observable space to the evolution trajectories of the BCO formation channels with cosmic time and apply it to the third GW transient catalog (GWTC-3) that brings new insights into probable astrophysical formation scenarios of nearly $90$ events. Our study reveals that two events, GW190425 and GW230529, show an overlap with a $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ trajectory of the same formation channel arising from a sub-solar mass black hole scenario that has grown into a higher mass by accretion, hinting towards the common primordial origin of both these sources. Though the actual formation channel is yet to be confirmed, with the availability of more GW events, the $\texttt{BCO Phase Space}$ can delve into distinguishing features of different formation channels for both astrophysical and primordial origin and opens the possibility of bringing new and deeper insights on the formation and evolution of BCOs across all observable masses over most of the cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: laboratory beam characterization for the first small aperture telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory is a ground-based telescope array located at an elevation of 5200 meters, in the Atacama Desert in Chile, designed to measure the temperature and polarization of the cosmic microwave background. It comprises four telescopes: three 0.42-meter small aperture telescopes (SATs), focused on searching for primordial gravitational waves, and one 6-meter large aperture telescope, focused on studying small-scale perturbations. Each of the SATs will field over 12,000 TES bolometers, with two SATs sensitive to both 90 and 150GHz frequency bands (SAT-MF1, and SAT-MF2), while the third SAT is sensitive to 220 and 280GHz frequency bands. Prior to its deployment in 2023, the optical properties of SAT-MF1 were characterized in the laboratory. We report on measurements of near-field beam maps acquired using a thermal source along with measurements using a holographic method that enables characterization of the amplitude and phase of the beam response, yielding an estimate of the far-field radiation pattern received by SAT-MF1. We find that the near-field half-width-half-maximum (HWHM) requirements are met across the focal plane array for the 90GHz frequency band, and through most of the focal plane array for the 150GHz frequency band. The mean of the bandpass averaged HWHM of the edge-detector focal plane modules match the simulated HWHM to 10.4%, with the discrepancy caused by fringing in the simulation. The measured beam profiles match simulations to within 2dB from the beam center to at least the -10dB level. Holography estimates of the far-field 90GHz beams match the full-width-half-maximum from simulation within 1%, and the beam profiles deviate by less than 2dB inside the central lobe. The success of the holography and thermal beam map experiments confirmed the optical performance was sufficient to meet the science requirements. On-site observations are currently underway.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way and M31 Orbital History: Did the Local Group evolve in isolation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use new measurements of the M31 proper motion to examine the Milky Way (MW) - M31 orbit and angular momentum. For Local Group (LG) mass consistent with measured values, and assuming the system evolves in isolation, we show a wide range of orbits is possible. We compare to a sample of LG-like systems in the Illustris simulation and find that $\sim 13\%$ of these pairs have undergone a pericentric passage. Using the simulated sample, we examine how accurately an isolated, two-body model describes the MW-M31 orbit, and show that $\sim 10\%$ of the analogues in the simulation are well-modeled by such an orbit. Systems that evolve in isolation by this definition are found to have a lower rate of major mergers and, in particular, have no major mergers since $z \approx 0.3$. For all systems, we find an increase in the orbital angular momentum, which is fairly independent of the merger rate and is possibly explained by the influence of tidal torques on the LG. Given the likely quiet recent major merger history of the MW, it is plausible that the isolated two-body model appropriately describes the orbit, though recent evidence for a major merger in M31 may complicate this interpretation.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses are valuable objects for a variety of astrophysical and cosmological applications. Strong lensing galaxies are rare, so efficient search methods, such as convolutional neural networks, are often used on large imaging datasets. In this work, we apply a new technique to improve the performance of supervised neural networks by subtracting the central (lensing) galaxy light from both the training and test datasets. We use multiband imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) as our training and test datasets. By subtracting the lensing galaxy light, we increase the contrast of the lensed source compared to the original imaging data. We also apply the light subtraction to non-lenses in order to compare them to the light-subtracted lenses. Residual features resulting from poor light subtraction can adversely affect the performance of networks trained on the subtracted images alone. We find that combining the light-subtracted images with the original gri-band images for training and classification can overcome this and improve the overall classification accuracy. We find the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve can be improved to 0.841 using the combination of the fiducial images and light-subtracted images, compared to 0.808 for the fiducial imaging dataset alone. This may be a promising technique for improving future lens searches using CNNs.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Xu \&amp; Jing (2022) reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass (\(M_h\)) and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index (\(n\)), at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of \(11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7\), using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on \(n\), we confirm a positive correlation between \(n\) and \(M_h\), and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of \(n\) and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between \(M_h\) and \(n\). Furthermore, disabling jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback in SIMBA simulations results in the disappearance of the positive \(n-M_h\) relationship, suggesting that the star formation history influenced by black holes may be a contributing factor.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the global structure of the recently discovered family of $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant potentials describing inflationary $\alpha$-attractors. These potentials have an inflationary plateau consisting of the fundamental domain and its images fully covering the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane. Meanwhile, the lower part of the half-plane is covered by an infinitely large number of ridges, which, at first glance, are too sharp to support inflation. However, we show that this apparent sharpness is just an illusion created by hyperbolic geometry, and each of these ridges is physically equivalent to the inflationary plateau in the upper part of the Poincar\'e half-plane.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation from Type II Fluctuations with Primordial Non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations with large amplitudes and non-Gaussianity. Ref. \cite{Uehara:2024yyp} showed that fluctuations with large amplitudes lead to the formation of type B PBHs, characterized by the existence of the bifurcating trapping horizons, distinct from the more common type A PBHs without a bifurcating trapping horizon. We focus on the local type non-Gaussianity characterized by the curvature perturbation $\zeta$ given by a function of a Gaussian random variable $\zeta_{\rm G}$ as $\beta\zeta=-\ln(1-\beta \zeta_{\rm G})$ with a parameter $\beta$. Then we examine how the non-Gaussianity influences the dynamics and the type of PBH formed, particularly focusing on type II fluctuations, where the areal radius varies non-monotonically with the coordinate radius. Our findings indicate that, for $\beta&gt;-2$, the threshold for distinguishing between type A and type B PBHs decreases with increasing $\beta$ similarly to the threshold for black hole formation. Additionally, for large positive values of $\beta$, the threshold for type B PBHs approaches that for type II fluctuations. We also find that, for a sufficiently large negative value of $\beta\lesssim-4.0$, the threshold value is in the type II region of $\mu$, i.e., there are fluctuations of type II that do not form black holes. Lastly, we calculate the PBH mass for several values of $\beta$. Then we observe that the final mass monotonically increases with the initial amplitude within the parameter region of type A PBHs, which differs from previous analytical expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced ALP Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-perturbative gravitational effects induce explicit global symmetry breaking terms within axion models. These exponentially suppressed terms in the potential give a mass contribution to the axion-like particles (ALPs). In this work we investigate this scenario with a scalar field charged under a global $U(1)$ symmetry and having a non-minimal coupling to gravity. Given the exponential dependence, the ALP can retain a mass spanning a wide range, which can act as a dark matter component. We specify pre-inflationary and post-inflationary production mechanisms of these ALPs, with the former from the misalignment mechanism and the latter from both the misalignment and cosmic-string decay. We identify the allowed parameter ranges that explain the dark matter abundance for both a general inflation case and a case where the radial mode scalar drives inflation, each in metric and Palatini formalisms. We show that the ALP can be the dominant component of the dark matter in a wide range of its mass, $m_{a} \in [10^{-21}~\mathrm{eV},\, \mathrm{TeV}]$, depending on the inflationary scenario and the $U(1)$ breaking scale. These results indicate that ALPs can be responsible for our dark matter abundance within a setup purely from non-perturbative gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>From Dark Matter Minihalos to Large-Scale Radiative Feedback: A Self-Consistent 3D Simulation of the First Stars and Galaxies using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key obstacle to accurate models of the first stars and galaxies is the vast range of distance scales that must be considered. While star formation occurs on sub-parsec scales within dark matter (DM) minihalos, it is influenced by large-scale baryon-dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm bc}$) and Lyman-Werner (LW) radiative feedback which vary significantly on scales of $\sim$100 Mpc. We present a novel approach to this issue in which we utilize artificial neural networks (NNs) to emulate the Population III (PopIII) and Population II (PopII) star formation histories of many small-scale cells given by a more complex semi-analytic framework based on DM halo merger trees. Within each simulation cell, the NN takes a set of input parameters that depend on the surrounding large-scale environment, such as the cosmic overdensity, $\delta(\vec{x})$, and $v_{\rm bc}$ of the cell, then outputs the resulting star formation far more efficiently than is possible with the semi-analytic model. This rapid emulation allows us to self-consistently determine the LW background intensity on $\sim$100 Mpc scales, while simultaneously including the detailed merger histories (and corresponding star formation histories) of the low-mass minihalos that host the first stars. Comparing with the full semi-analytic framework utilizing DM halo merger trees, our NN emulators yield star formation histories with redshift-averaged errors of $\sim$10.2\% and $\sim$9.2\% for PopII and PopIII, respectively. When compared to a simpler sub-grid star formation prescription reliant on halo mass function integration, we find that the diversity of halo merger histories in our simulation leads to enhanced spatial fluctuations, an earlier transition from PopIII to PopII dominated star formation, and more scatter in star formation histories overall.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Effects in Black Hole Ringdown Made Simple: Quasi-Normal Modes as Adiabatic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear nature of general relativity manifests prominently throughout the merger of two black holes, from the inspiral phase to the final ringdown. Notably, the quasi-normal modes generated during the ringdown phase display significant nonlinearities. We show that these nonlinear effects can be effectively captured by zooming in on the photon ring through the Penrose limit. Specifically, we model the quasi-normal modes as null particles trapped in unstable circular orbits around the black holes and show that they can be interpreted as adiabatic modes, perturbations that are arbitrarily close to large diffeomorphisms. This enables the derivation of a simple analytical expression for the QNM nonlinearities for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes which reproduces well the existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Scale Multi-Phase Circumgalactic Medium: Observed and Simulated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are exciting times for studies of galaxy formation and the growth of structures. New observatories and advanced simulations are revolutionising our understanding of the cycling of matter into, through, and out of galaxies. This chapter first describes why baryons are essential for galaxy evolution, providing a key test of Lambda-Cold Dark Matter cosmological model. In particular, we describe a basic framework to convert measurements of the gas properties observed in absorption spectra into global estimates of the condensed (stars and cold gas) matter mass densities. We then review our current understanding of the cycling of baryons from global to galactic scales, in the so-called circumgalactic medium. The final sections are dedicated to future prospects, identifying new techniques and up-coming facilities as well as key open questions. This chapter is complemented with a series of hands-on exercises which provide a practical guide to using publicly available hydrodynamical cosmological simulations. Beyond providing a direct connection between new observations and advanced simulations, these exercises give the reader the necessary tools to make use of these theoretical models to address their own science questions. Ultimately, our increasingly accurate description of the circumgalactic medium reveals its crucial role in transforming the pristine early Universe into the rich and diverse Universe of the present day.</description>

      <title>$\tilde\xi$-attractors in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of inflationary attractors in metric-affine gravity. Such class features a non-minimal coupling $\tilde\xi \, \Omega(\phi)$ with the Holst invariant $\tilde{R}$ and an inflaton potential proportional to $\Omega(\phi)^2$. The attractor behaviour of the class takes place with two combined strong coupling limits. The first limit is realized at large $\tilde\xi$, which makes the theory equivalent to a $\tilde{R}^2$ model. Then, the second limit considers a very small Barbero-Immirzi parameter which leads the inflationary predictions of the $\tilde{R}^2$ model towards the ones of Starobinsky inflation. Because of the analogy with the renown $\xi$-attractors, we label this new class as $\tilde\xi$-attractors.</description>

      <title>Simulating continuum-based redshift measurement in the \textit{Roman's} High Latitude Spectroscopy Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the \textit{Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's (Roman)} Wide-Field Instrument (WFI) G150 slitless grism to detect red, quiescent galaxies based on the current reference survey. We simulate dispersed images for \textit{Roman} reference High-Latitude Spectroscopic Survey (HLSS) and analyze two-dimensional spectroscopic data using the grism Redshift and Line Analysis (\verb|Grizli|) software. This study focus on assessing \textit{Roman} grism's capability for continuum-level redshift measurement for a redshift range of $0.5 \leq z \leq 2.5$. The redshift recovery is assessed by setting three requirements of: $\sigma_z = \frac{\left|z-z_{\mathrm{true}}\right|}{1+z}\leq0.01$, signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) $\geq 5$ and the presence of a single dominant peak in redshift likelihood function. We find that, for quiescent galxaies, the reference HLSS can reach a redshift recovery completeness of $\geq50\%$ for F158 magnitude brighter than 20.2 mag. We also explore how different survey parameters, such as exposure time and the number of exposures, influence the accuracy and completeness of redshift recovery, providing insights that could optimize future survey strategies and enhance the scientific yield of the \textit{Roman} in cosmological research.</description>

      <title>Superhorizon isocurvature fluctuations relax tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new class of models that have potential to alleviate tensions present in the cosmological data today. We postulate about variation in the sound horizon scale on superhorizon scales, i.e., on scales that are larger than that of the present observable low-redshift Universe ($\gtrsim 1\,$Gpc) while at the same time smaller than the largest scales probed by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) ($\lesssim10\,$Gpc). In this scenario, CMB peaks are naturally smoothed as preferred by the Planck data, while at the same time the low-redshift baryon acoustic oscillation calibration is partially decoupled from the CMB. Taking superhorizon variations in baryon fraction as an example and using approximate modeling, we find improvement in the best fit Planck power spectrum model $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 6$ for 1 extra degree of freedom with the relevant extension parameter $10^3 \sigma_b = 2.10 \pm 0.60 $, implying about 10\% variations in baryon fraction across the Universe. At the same time, $S_8$ drops by about 1 sigma, easing tension with weak lensing surveys. We find that the combination of Planck 2018 data, eBOSS BAO data, and Riess \textit{et al.} distance ladder Hubble parameter determination produce a satisfactory fit in our model if we allow for a phantom dark energy equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the second order energy density perturbation $\delta^{(2)}$ induced by small-scale Gaussian and local-type non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbations. The relative abundance of primordial black hole is calculated in terms of the probability density function of total energy density perturbation $\delta_r=\delta^{(1)}+\frac{1}{2}\delta^{(2)}$. The effects of second order density perturbation greatly reduce the upper bounds of small-scale power spectra of primordial curvature perturbations by one to two orders of magnitude. For log-normal primordial power spectrum, its amplitude $A_{\zeta}$ is constrained to be about $A_{\zeta}\sim 3\times10^{-3}$. And for local-type non-Gaussianity with $f_{\mathrm{NL}}=10$, the upper bound of $A_{\zeta}$ is about $2.5\times10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Super-resolution of Cosmological Simulations with Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully employed for augmenting low-resolution cosmological simulations with small-scale information, a task known as "super-resolution". So far, these cosmological super-resolution models have relied on generative adversarial networks (GANs), which can achieve highly realistic results, but suffer from various shortcomings (e.g. low sample diversity). We introduce denoising diffusion models as a powerful generative model for super-resolving cosmic large-scale structure predictions (as a first proof-of-concept in two dimensions). To obtain accurate results down to small scales, we develop a new "filter-boosted" training approach that redistributes the importance of different scales in the pixel-wise training objective. We demonstrate that our model not only produces convincing super-resolution images and power spectra consistent at the percent level, but is also able to reproduce the diversity of small-scale features consistent with a given low-resolution simulation. This enables uncertainty quantification for the generated small-scale features, which is critical for the usefulness of such super-resolution models as a viable surrogate model for cosmic structure formation.</description>

Abstract: One of the surprising aspects of the present Universe, is the absence of any noticeable observable effects of higher-rank antisymmetric tensor fields in any natural phenomena. Here, we address the possible explanation of the absence of the higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We explore the cosmological evolution of the scalar degrees of freedom associated with higher curvature term in a general $f(R)$ gravity model $f (R) = R +\alpha_n R^n$. We show that while different cosmological parameters mimic standard behaviour at different epochs for different forms of higher curvature gravity (i.e. different values of n ), only Starobinsky model (n = 2) gives a natural justification for the invisibility of the signatures of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric fields. In contrast, for other models ($n\neq2$), despite their agreement with standard cosmology, the scalar degree of freedom induces an enhancement in the coupling of the antisymmetric fields and thereby contradicts the observation. The result does not change even with the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant. Thus, our result reveals that among different $f(R)$ models, Starobinsky model successfully explains the suppression of the massless modes of higher rank antisymmetric tensor fields leading to their invisibility in the present universe.</description>

      <title>A Cohesive Deep Drilling Field Strategy for LSST Cosmology</title>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will image billions of astronomical objects in the wide-fast-deep primary survey and in a set of minisurveys including intensive observations of a group of deep drilling fields (DDFs). The DDFs are a critical piece of three key aspects of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) cosmological measurements: they provide a required calibration for photometric redshifts and weak gravitational lensing measurements and they directly contribute to cosmological constraints from the most distant type Ia supernovae. We present a set of cohesive DDF strategies fulfilling science requirements relevant to DESC and following the guidelines of the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee. We propose a method to estimate the observing strategy parameters and we perform simulations of the corresponding surveys. We define a set of metrics for each of the science case to assess the performance of the proposed observing strategies. We show that the most promising results are achieved with deep rolling surveys characterized by two sets of fields: ultradeep fields (z&lt;1.1) observed at a high cadence with a large number of visits over a limited number of seasons; deep fields (z&lt;0.7), observed with a cadence of ~3 nights for ten years. These encouraging results should be confirmed with realistic simulations using the LSST scheduler. A DDF budget of ~8.5% is required to design observing strategies satisfying all the cosmological requirements. A lower DDF budget lead to surveys that either do not fulfill photo-z/WL requirements or are not optimal for SNe Ia cosmology.</description>

      <title>The Three Hundred project: Estimating the dependence of gas filaments on the mass of galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are located in the densest areas of the universe and are intricately connected to larger structures through the filamentary network of the Cosmic Web. In this scenario, matter flows from areas of lower density to higher density. As a result, the properties of galaxy clusters are deeply influenced by the filaments that are attached to them, which are quantified by a parameter known as connectivity. We explore the dependence of gas-traced filaments connected to galaxy clusters on the mass and dynamical state of the cluster. Moreover, we evaluate the effectiveness of the cosmic web extraction procedure from the gas density maps of simulated cluster regions. Using the DisPerSE cosmic web finder, we identify filamentary structures from 3D gas particle distribution in 324 simulated regions of $30 \, h^{-1}$ Mpc side from The Three Hundred hydrodynamical simulation at redshifts z=0, 1, and 2. We estimate the connectivity at various apertures for $\sim3000$ groups and clusters spanning a mass range from $10^{13} \, h^{-1} \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{15} \, h^{-1} \, M_{\odot}$. Relationships between connectivity and cluster properties like radius, mass, dynamical state and hydrostatic mass bias are explored. We show that the connectivity is strongly correlated with the mass of galaxy clusters, with more massive clusters being on average more connected. This finding aligns with previous studies in literature, both from observational and simulated data sets. Additionally, we observe a dependence of the connectivity on the aperture at which it is estimated. We find that connectivity decreases with cosmic time, while no dependencies on the dynamical state and hydrostatic mass bias of the cluster are found. Lastly, we observe a significant agreement between the connectivity measured from gas-traced and mock-galaxies-traced filaments in the simulation.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference post DESI DR1 BAO measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we implement Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe in a model-agnostic manner, using the Pantheon-Plus SN-Ia compilation in combination with two different BAO measurements (SDSS-IV and DESI DR1). In both the reconstructions, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included in the 95\% confidence intervals. We find evidence that the DESI LRG data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ is not an outlier within our model-independent framework. We study the $\mathcal{O}m$-diagnostics and the evolution of the total equation of state (EoS) of our universe, which hint towards the possibility of a quintessence-like dark energy scenario with a very slowly varying EoS, and a phantom-crossing in higher $z$. The entire exercise is later complemented by considering two more SN-Ia compilations - DES-5YR and Union3 - in combination with DESI BAO. Reconstruction with the DESI BAO + DES-5YR SN data sets predicts that the $\Lambda$CDM model lies outside the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels, whereas with DESI BAO + Union3 data, the $\Lambda$CDM model is always included within 1$\sigma$. We also report constraints on $H_0 r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics. Our results point towards an $\approx$ 2$\sigma$ discrepancy between the DESI + Pantheon-Plus and DESI + DES-5YR data sets, which calls for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Constraining small-scale primordial magnetic fields from the abundance of primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of magnetic fields in the early universe affects the cosmological processes, leading to the distinct signature, which allows constraining their properties and the genesis mechanisms. In this study, we revisit the method to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic fields on small scales in the radiation-dominated era from the abundance of primordial black holes. Constraints in the previous work were based on the fact that the density perturbations sourced by stronger magnetic fields become large enough to gravitationally collapse to form PBHs. However, we demonstrate that this picture is incomplete because magnetic fields also increase the threshold value of the density contrast required for PBH formation. The increase in threshold density contrast is more pronounced on smaller scales, and in extreme cases, it might even prevent PBH production despite the presence of significant magnetic field. Taking into account the relevant physical effects on the magnetized overdense region, we establish an upper-limit on the amplitude of comoving magnetic fields, approximately $0.13-0.15 {\rm \mu G}$ at a scale of $10^{17} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare our constraints with various small-scale probes.</description>

Abstract: Since about a decade, we have finally entered the era of discoveries of multiply-imaged gravitationally lensed supernovae. To date, all cluster lensed supernovae, very distant, faint and spatially resolved, have been found from space. In contrast, those deflected by individual galaxies have been very compact and bright enough to be identified with wide-field ground-based surveys through the magnification of "standard candles" method, i.e., without the need of spatially resolving the individual images. We review the challenges in identifying these extremely rare events, as well as the unique opportunities they offer for two major applications: time-delay cosmography and the study of the properties of the deflecting bodies acting as lenses.</description>

Abstract: We consider three cosmological models with non-power-law spectra of primordial density perturbations and test them against $\Lambda$CDM in density profiles of dark matter halos. We found that, despite the significant difference in initial conditions, the mean density profiles of all models are still close to the Navarro-Frenk-White one, albeit with some dispersion. We demonstrate that the density profile slopes in the innermost part of halo have a significant evolution with $z$, which can be used to identify the cosmological model. We also present a toy model resulting in the appearance of core in the central part of dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Modelling the BOSS void-galaxy cross-correlation function using a neural-network emulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an emulator-based method to model the cross-correlation between cosmological voids and galaxies. This allows us to model the effect of cosmology on void finding and on the shape of the void-galaxy cross-correlation function, improving on previous template-based methods. We train a neural network using the AbacusSummit simulation suite and fit to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey sample. We recover information on the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions (RSD), and the geometry of the Universe through the Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) effect, measuring $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.330\pm 0.020$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.777^{+0.047}_{-0.062}$ for a $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$ cosmology. Comparing to results from a template-based method, we find that fitting the shape of the void-galaxy cross-correlation function provides more information and leads to an improvement in constraining power. In contrast, we find that errors on the AP measurements were previously underestimated if void centres were assumed to have the same response to the AP effect as galaxies - a common simplification. Overall, we recover a $28\%$ reduction in errors for $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ and similar errors on $\sigma_8$ with our new, more comprehensive, method. Given the statistical power of future surveys including DESI and Euclid, we expect the method presented to become the new baseline for the analysis of voids in these data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Interacting Dark Energy Models from the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and DES Supernovae Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent results from the first year baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernova (SN) data, have shown a detection of significant deviation from a cosmological constant for dark energy. In this work, we utilize the latest DESI BAO data in combination with the SN data from the full five-year observations of the Dark Energy Survey and the CMB data from the Planck satellite to explore potential interactions between dark energy and dark matter. We consider four typical forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our findings suggest that interacting dark energy (IDE) models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ support the presence of an interaction where dark energy decays into dark matter. Specifically, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM for the IDE model with $Q=\beta H_0\rho_{\rm de}$ reaches the $3\sigma$ level. These models yield a lower value of Akaike information criterion than the $\Lambda$CDM model, indicating a preference for these IDE models based on the current observational data. For IDE models with $Q\propto\rho_{\rm c}$, the existence of interaction depends on the form of the proportionality coefficient $\Gamma$. The IDE model with $Q=\beta H\rho_{\rm c}$ yields $\beta=0.0003\pm 0.0011$, which essentially does not support the presence of the interaction. In general, whether the observational data support the existence of interaction is closely related to the model. Our analysis helps to elucidate which type of IDE model can better explain the current observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate Friedmann's equations as second-order linear differential equations. This is done using techniques related to the Schwarzian derivative that selects the $\beta$-times $t_\beta:=\int^t a^{-2\beta}$, where $a$ is the scale factor. In particular, it turns out that Friedmann's equations are equivalent to the eigenvalue problems $$ O_{1/2} \Psi=\frac{\Lambda}{12}\Psi \ , \qquad O_1 a =\frac{\Lambda}{3} a \ , $$ which is suggestive of a measurement problem. $O_{\beta}(\rho,p)$ are space-independent Klein-Gordon operators, depending only on energy density and pressure, and related to the Klein-Gordon Hamilton-Jacobi equations. The $O_\beta$'s are also independent of the spatial curvature, labeled by $k$, and absorbed in $$ \Psi=\sqrt a e^{\frac{i}{2}\sqrt{k}\eta} \ . $$ The above pair of equations is the unique possible linear form of Friedmann's equations unless $k=0$, in which case there are infinitely many pairs of linear equations. Such a uniqueness just selects the conformal time $\eta\equiv t_{1/2}$ among the $t_\beta$'s, which is the key to absorb the curvature term. An immediate consequence of the linear form is that it reveals a new symmetry of Friedmann's equations in flat space.</description>

      <title>Listening to the Universe with Next Generation Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we use simple performance metrics to assess the science capabilities of future ground-based gravitational-wave detector networks -- composed of A+ or Voyager upgrades to the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories and proposed next generation observatories such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. These metrics refer to coalescences of binary neutron stars (BNSs) and binary black holes (BBHs) and include: (i) network detection efficiency and detection rate of cosmological sources as a function of redshift, (ii) signal-to-noise ratios and the accuracy with which intrinsic and extrinsic parameters would be measured, and (iii) enabling multimessenger astronomy with gravitational waves by accurate 3D localization and early warning alerts. We further discuss the science enabled by the small population of rare and extremely loud events. While imminent upgrades will provide impressive advances in all these metrics, next generation observatories will deliver an improvement of an order-of-magnitude or more in most metrics. In fact, a network containing two or three such facilities will detect half of all the BNS and BBH mergers up to a redshift of $z=1$ and $z=20$, respectively, give access to hundreds of BNSs and ten thousand BBHs with signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 100, readily localize hundreds to thousands of mergers to within $1\,{\rm deg^2}$ on the sky and better than 10% in luminosity distance, respectively, and consequently, enable mutlimessenger astronomy through follow-up surveys in the electromagnetic spectrum several times a week. Such networks will further shed light on potential cosmological merger populations and detect an abundance of high-fidelity BNS and BBH signals which will allow investigations of the high-density regime of matter at an unprecedented level and enable precision tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime, respectively.</description>

      <title>Minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a nonminimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main limitation for preinflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with grand unified theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. We propose a mechanism that explicitly breaks PQ symmetry via nonminimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the nonminimal coupling, before it moves to its true $CP$-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA, DMRadio or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed array of next-generation inertial sensors to monitor the response of the Moon to gravitational waves (GWs). Given the size of the Moon and the expected noise produced by the lunar seismic background, the LGWA would be able to observe GWs from about 1 mHz to 1 Hz. This would make the LGWA the missing link between space-borne detectors like LISA with peak sensitivities around a few millihertz and proposed future terrestrial detectors like Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer. In this article, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of the LGWA science case including its multi-messenger aspects and lunar science with LGWA data. We also describe the scientific analyses of the Moon required to plan the LGWA mission.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons Induced Thermal Friction on Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions of the solitonic domain walls that occur in realistic axion electrodynamics models including the Chern-Simons interaction, $a\epsilon_{\mu\nu\lambda\sigma}F^{\mu\nu} F^{\lambda\sigma}$, between an axion $a(x)$ of mass $m_a$, and a massless U(1) gauge field, e.g. EM, interacting with strength $\alpha=e^2/4\pi$ with charged matter, e.g. electron-positron pairs. In particular, in the presence of a U(1) gauge-and-matter relativistic thermal plasma we study the friction experienced by the walls due to the Chern-Simons term. Utilizing the linear response method we include the collective effects of the plasma, as opposed to purely particle scattering across the wall (as is done in previous treatments) which is valid only in the thin wall regime that is rarely applicable in realistic cases. We show that the friction depends on the Lorentz-$\gamma$-factor-dependent inverse thickness of the wall in the plasma frame, $\ell^{-1} \sim \gamma m_a$, compared to the three different plasma scales, the temperature $T$, the Debye mass $m_D\sim\sqrt{\alpha} T$, and the damping rate $\Gamma \sim \alpha^2 T$, and elucidate the underlying physical intuition for this behavior. (For friction in the thin-wall-limit we correct previous expressions in the literature.) We further consider the effects of long-range coherent magnetic fields that are possibly present in the early universe and compare their effect with that of thermal magnetic fields. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible early universe consequences of our results for domain wall motion and network decay, stochastic gravitational wave production from domain wall networks, and possible primordial black hole production from domain wall collapse, though a more complete discussion of these topics is reserved for a companion paper.</description>
