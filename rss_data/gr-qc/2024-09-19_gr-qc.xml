      <title>Elucidating the z-dependence of the MOND acceleration (a_0) within the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper: ``On the time dependency of $a_0$" the authors claim that they have tested ``one of the predictions of the Scale Invariant Vacuum (SIV) theory on MOND" by studying the dependence of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) acceleration at two data sets, low-$z$ ($3.2\times10^{-4}\le z\le 3.2\times10^{-2}$) and high-$z$ ($0.5\le z\le 2.5$). They claim ``both samples show a dependency of $a_0$ from $z$". Here, the work mentioned above is revisited. The explicit analytic expression for the $z$-dependence of the $a_0$ within the SIV theory is given. Furthermore, the first estimates of the $\Omega_m$ within SIV theory give $\Omega_{m}=0.28\pm 0.04$ using the low-z data only, while a value of $\Omega_{m}=0.055$ is obtained using both data sets. This much lower $\Omega_m$ leaves no room for non-baryonic matter! Unlike in the mentioned paper above, the slope in the $z$-dependence of $A_0=\log_{10}(a_0)$ is estimated to be consistent with zero Z-slope for the two data sets. Finally, the statistics of the data are consistent with the SIV predictions; in particular, the possibility of change in the sign of the slopes for the two data sets is explainable within the SIV paradigm; however, the uncertainty in the data is too big for the clear demonstration of a $z$-dependence yet.</description>

      <title>Knot invariants and indefinite causal order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore indefinite causal order between events in the context of quasiclassical spacetimes in superposition. We introduce several new quantifiers to measure the degree of indefiniteness of the causal order for an arbitrary finite number of events and spacetime configurations in superposition. By constructing diagrammatic and knot-theoretic representations of the causal order between events, we find that the definiteness or maximal indefiniteness of the causal order is topologically invariant. This reveals an intriguing connection between the field of quantum causality and knot theory. Furthermore, we provide an operational encoding of indefinite causal order and discuss how to incorporate a measure of quantum coherence into our classification.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Approach to Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations of black hole spacetimes exhibit divergent behavior toward the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. This divergence can be understood as a consequence of the geometry in these spacetime regions. In contrast, black-hole oscillations are regular when evaluated toward the event horizon and null infinity. Hyperboloidal surfaces naturally connect these regions, providing a geometric regularization of time-harmonic oscillations called quasinormal modes (QNMs). This review traces the historical development of the hyperboloidal approach to QNMs. We discuss the physical motivation for the hyperboloidal approach and highlight current developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous scalarization of Bardeen black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spontaneous scalarization of Bardeen black holes, whose tachyonic instability triggers the formation of scalarized charged black holes (SCBHs). In this case, we find infinite ($n=0,1,2,\cdots$) branches of SCBHs with magnetic charge $g$. The $n = 0$ branch of SCBHs can be found for the coupling parameter $\alpha \geq \alpha_{n=0}(g)$ with both quadratic (1-$\alpha \varphi^2$) and exponential ($e^{-\alpha \varphi^2}$) couplings, where $\alpha_{n=0}(g)$ represents the threshold of tachyonic instability for the Bardeen black holes. Furthermore, it is shown that the $n = 0$ branch for both couplings is stable against radial perturbations. This stability shows that this branch can be used for further observational implications.</description>

      <title>New canonical analysis for consistent extension of $\lambda R$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical analysis of the $\lambda R$ model extended with the term due to Blas, Pujolas, and Sibiryakov $[BPS]$ is performed. The analysis is developed for any value of $\lambda$, but particular attention is paid to the point $\lambda=\frac{1}{3}$ because of the closeness with linearized General Relativity [GR]. Then, we add the higher-order conformal term, the so-called Cotton-square term, to study the constraint structure of what constitutes an example of kinetic-conformal Horava's gravity. At the conformal point, an extra second-class constraint appears; this does not arise at other values of $\lambda$. Then, the Dirac brackets are constructed, and we will observe that the $\lambda R$-Cotton-square model shares the same number of degrees of freedom with linearized $GR$.</description>

      <title>Extended Metric-Affine $f(R)$ Gravity with Dynamical Connection in Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the usual vacuum Metric-Affine $f(R)$ Gravity by supplementing it with all parity even quadratic invariants in torsion and non-metricity. As we show explicitly this supplementation drastically changes the status of the Theory which now propagates an additional scalar degree of freedom on top of the graviton. This scalar degree of freedom has a geometric origin as it relates to spacetime torsion and non-metricity. The resulting Theory can be written equivalently as a metric and torsionless Scalar-Tensor Theory whose potential and kinetic term coupling depend on the choice of the function $f(R)$ and the dimensionless parameters of the quadratic invariants respectively.</description>

      <title>Analyzing gravitational wave effects in general modified gravity: an example based on the most general vector-tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Isaacson picture provides a general method for describing the effects of gravitational waves, established on two sets of basic equations. The first set of equations describes the propagation of gravitational waves within a given background, while the second set elucidates the interaction between the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves and the background metric. These two sets of equations are typically derived by expanding the field equations to second-order perturbations. In addition to the method of perturbing field equations, there is an alternative method: obtaining the two sets of basic equations by expanding the action to the second-order of perturbations. In this paper, we elaborate on this method, establishing its foundations more rigorously. Especially, the second-order perturbation action, with the Minkowski metric as the background, contains all necessary information to construct the Isaacson picture far from the source. We outline the derivation of the two sets of basic equations to describe the gravitational wave effects in the Isaacson picture, based on the second-order perturbation action. This will enable us to analyze the following effects: polarizations of gravitational waves, the wave speed for each polarization mode, the effective energy-momentum tensor of gravitational waves, and the nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves. We illustrate this method by applying it to the most general second-order vector-tensor theory including parity-breaking terms. We further analyze the polarization modes of gravitational waves in this theory. We highlight that this method facilitates model-independent research on various gravitational wave effects in general modified gravity theories. These effects are anticipated to be identified by the upcoming generation of gravitational wave detectors, aimed at testing potential modifications to gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Holographic Einstein Rings of AdS Black Holes in Horndeski Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11885v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence and wave optics techniques, we conducted an extensive study of the imaging properties of holographic Einstein rings in the context of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes (BHs) in Horndeski theory. Our results indicate that the optical characteristics of these holographic Einstein rings are significantly influenced by the observer's position, the physical parameters of the BH, the nature of the wave source, and the configuration of the optical system. Specifically, when the observer is positioned at the north pole of the AdS boundary, the holographic image prominently displays a ring structure aligning with the BH's photon sphere. We thoroughly analyzed how various physical parameters -- including the observation position, event horizon radius, temperature, and the parameter $\gamma$ in Horndeski theory -- affect the holographic Einstein rings. These parameters play a crucial role in determining the rings' radius and brightness, with variations potentially causing the ring structures to deform or even transform into bright spots. Furthermore, our comparative analysis between wave optics and geometric optics reveals a strong agreement in predicting the positions and brightnesses of both the photon ring and the Einstein ring. This research offers new insights into the spacetime geometry of BHs in Horndeski theory and proposes a promising framework for exploring the gravitational duals of strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>On the Euler-type gravitomagnetic orbital effects in the field of a precessing body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To the first post-Newtonian order, the gravitational action of mass-energy currents is encoded by the off-diagonal gravitomagnetic components of the spacetime metric tensor. If they are time-dependent, a further acceleration enters the equations of motion of a moving test particle. Let the source of the gravitational field be an isolated, massive body rigidly rotating whose spin angular momentum experiences a slow precessional motion. The impact of the aforementioned acceleration on the orbital motion of a test particle is analytically worked out in full generality. The resulting averaged rates of change are valid for any orbital configuration of the satellite; furthermore, they hold for an arbitrary orientation of the precessional velocity vector of the spin of the central object. In general, all the orbital elements, with the exception of the mean anomaly at epoch, undergo nonvanishing long-term variations which, in the case of the Juno spacecraft currently orbiting Jupiter and the double pulsar PSR J0737-3039 A/B turn out to be quite small. Such effects might become much more relevant in a star-supermassive black hole scenario; as an example, the relative change of the semimajor axis of a putative test particle orbiting a Kerr black hole as massive as the one at the Galactic Centre at, say, 100 Schwarzschild radii may amount up to about $7\%$ per year if the hole's spin precessional frequency is $10\%$ of the particle's orbital one.</description>

Abstract: The light rays trajectories in Kerr metric, resulting from Fermat's principle, are considered from the point of view of integrable systems.

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection and Energy Extraction from a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, magnetic reconnection has attracted considerable attention as a novel energy extraction mechanism, relying on the rapid reconnection of magnetic field lines within the ergosphere. We have investigated the properties of the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole spacetime with an extra deformation parameter. Our results show that the positive deformation parameter expands the possible region of energy extraction and improves the maximum power, maximum efficiency, and the maximum ratio of energy extraction between magnetic reconnection and the Blandford-Znajek process. This means that in the Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole spacetime one can extract more energy via magnetic reconnection than in the Kerr black hole case. These effects of the deformation parameter may provide valuable clues for future astronomical observations of black holes and verification of gravity theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider theories which break the invariance under diffeomorphisms (Diff) down to transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) in the matter sector, consisting of multiple scalar fields. In particular, we regard shift-symmetric models with two free TDiff scalar fields in a flat Robertson-Walker spacetime and use the perfect fluid approach to study their dynamics. As a consequence of the symmetry breaking, an effective interaction between the fields is induced from the conservation of the total energy-momentum tensor, without the necessity to introduce any explicit interacting term in the Lagrangian. We study the different single-field domination regimes and analyze the energy exchange between the fields. Thereupon, we introduce an application of these models for the description of interactions in the dark sector, and compare the theoretical predictions of our model to observational data from Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Leading Logarithm Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continual production of long wavelength gravitons during primordial inflation endows graviton loop corrections with secular growth factors. During a prolonged period of inflation these factors eventually overwhelm the small loop-counting parameter of $G H^2$, causing perturbation theory to break down. A technique was recently developed for summing the leading secular effects at each order in non-linear sigma models, which possess the same kind of derivative interactions as gravity. This technique combines a variant of Starobinsky's stochastic formalism with a variant of the renormalization group. We generalize the new technique to quantum gravity, resulting in a Langevin equation in which secular changes in gravitational phenomena are driven by stochastic fluctuations of the graviton field.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a massive, rotating object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a massive, rotating body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied first to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit. While its gravitoelectric shifts occurred close to the Sun's flyby are less than some tens of milliarcseconds, those due to the solar oblateness and angular momentum are of the order of microarcseconds throughout the whole trajectory. Comparable values occur for the post-Newtonian shifts of the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth, while those due to the oblateness of the latter are nominally several orders of magnitude larger. The current (formal) uncertainty in the quadrupole mass moment of the geopotential would bring the mismodeling of such classical effects below the nominal value of the predicted relativistic disturbances. The hyperbolic excess velocity is not changed by any of the post--Keplerian accelerations considered. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>

      <title>Field Sources for $f(R,R_{\mu\nu})$ Black-Bounce Solutions: The Case of K-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of Simpson-Visser, the search for field sources that produce black bounces in alternative gravity theories has remained unresolved. In this paper, the first in a series exploring sources for alternative theories of gravity, we identify such a source for the $2+1$ dimensional K-gravity black bounce. The K-gravity black hole is notable for allowing asymptotically locally flat solutions in lower-dimensional spacetime, yet it possesses curvature singularities concealed within the event horizon. Using the Simpson-Visser regularization technique, we eliminate this singularity, constructing asymptotically locally flat black-bounce solutions in $2+1$ dimensions. We explore the causal structure of these solutions, identifying the conditions under which they describe regular black holes or wormholes. By calculating curvature invariants, we confirm the absence of singularities within the event horizon. Additionally, we demonstrate that, beyond non-linear electrodynamics, a non-linear scalar field is required to source the solution. Finally, we investigate the geodesic structure of this spacetime, analyzing the trajectories of both massive and massless particles. We also confirm the existence of circular orbits and assess their stability.</description>

      <title>From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the primordial black hole reheating scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas, especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any early matter-dominated universe scenario.</description>

      <title>Matter Geometry Coupling and Casimir Wormhole Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate traversable wormhole solutions within the setup of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity, a modified theory of gravity where the gravitational action relies upon the matter Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{m}$ and the Ricci scalar $R$. In General Relativity (GR), stability issues in traversable wormholes necessitate the existence of exotic matter that violates the null energy condition (NEC). In contrast, we explore wormhole solutions that align with the criteria for Casimir wormholes, which do not necessarily require NEC violation. Our analysis demonstrates that in the context of $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity, exotic matter can sustain these wormholes. We further examine the traversability conditions of the wormhole, considering both scenarios with and without the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) correction. Additionally, the stability of the wormhole is assessed based on equilibrium conditions. Our findings suggest that $f(R,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity offers a viable framework for the existence of stable, traversable wormholes sustained by exotic matter, potentially expanding the landscape of viable wormhole solutions beyond the confines of GR.</description>

      <title>Assessing the potential of LIGO-India in resolving the Hubble Tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the Hubble constant (H0), a fundamental parameter describing cosmic expansion, remains a challenge due to conflicting measurements from the early and late universe. Gravitational wave (GW) observations from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, with identified host galaxies through electromagnetic (EM) follow-up, offer an independent method to measure H0. However, this requires detection of numerous events, which could take decades with current GW detectors. LIGO-India can dramatically accelerate this effort. With sensitivity comparable to the existing LIGO detectors, its addition to the LIGO-Virgo network could increase detected events by 70%. This improvement nearly doubles when accounting for the detector's 70% duty cycle, increasing the probability of simultaneous operation of three detectors by a factor of ~2. We perform end-to-end simulations to estimate triple-coincidence detection rates and sky localization, considering realistic BNS populations, lightcurves, and EM observatory specifications. Our findings suggest LIGO-India could increase BNS events with observed kilonovae by ~2-7 times. The factor of few improvements in source localization precision with LIGO-India can allow much deeper EM follow-up campaigns (not considered in the simulations), potentially increasing the overall rate of detection of EM counterparts by a factor of ~20, which can have an enormous impact in addressing critical questions in different areas of astronomy. We evaluate the impact of LIGO-India in the context of H0 measurement and argue that it can cut down the required observation time of several decades by a factor of few and possibly to just few years with regular sensitivity upgrades.</description>

      <title>The long freeze: an asymptotically static universe from holographic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that some holographic dark energy models can lead to a future evolution of the universe in which the scale factor $a$ is asymptotically constant, while $\dot a \rightarrow 0$ and the corresponding energy and pressure densities also vanish. We provide specific examples of such models and general conditions that can lead to an asymptotically static universe, which we have called the ``long freeze." We show that in some cases, such evolution can follow an arbitrarily long exponential expansion essentially identical to the asymptotic evolution of $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topological classes of the rotating, accelerating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work [D. Wu, Phys. Rev. D 108, 084041 (2023)] to more general cases by including a rotation parameter. We investigate the topological numbers for the rotating, accelerating neutral black hole and its AdS extension, as well as the rotating, accelerating charged black hole and its AdS extension. We find that the topological number of an asymptotically flat accelerating black hole consistently differs by one from that of its non-accelerating counterpart. Furthermore, we show that for an asymptotically AdS accelerating black hole, the topological number is reduced by one compared to its non-accelerating AdS counterpart. In addition, we demonstrate that within the framework of general relativity, the acceleration parameter and the negative cosmological constant each independently add one to the topological number. However, when both factors are present, their effects neutralize each other, resulting in no overall change to the topological number.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Dark Photon Constraints from CMB Spectral Distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral distortions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide stringent constraints on energy and entropy production in the post-BBN (Big Bang Nucleosynthesis) era. This has been used to constrain dark photon models with COBE/FIRAS and forecast the potential gains with future CMB spectrometers. Here, we revisit these constraints by carefully considering the photon to dark photon conversion process and evolution of the distortion signal. Previous works only included the effect of CMB energy density changes but neglected the change to the photon number density. We clearly define the dark photon distortion signal and show that in contrast to previous analytic estimates the distortion has an opposite sign and a $\simeq 1.5$ times larger amplitude. We furthermore extend the treatment into the large distortion regime to also cover the redshift range $\simeq 2\times 10^6-4\times 10^7$ between the $\mu$-era and the end of BBN using CosmoTherm. This shows that the CMB distortion constraints for dark photon masses in the range $10^{-4}\,{\rm eV}\lesssim m_{\rm dp}\lesssim 10^{-3}\,{\rm eV}$ were significantly underestimated. We demonstrate that in the small distortion regime the distortion caused by photon to dark photon conversion is extremely close to a $\mu$-type distortion independent of the conversion redshift. This opens the possibility to study dark photon models using CMB distortion anisotropies and the correlations with CMB temperature anisotropies as we highlight here.</description>

      <title>Establishing significance of gravitational-wave signals from a single observatory in the PyCBC offline search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of compact binary coalescences are allowing us to see black holes and neutron stars further into the universe and recent results represent the most sensitive searches for compact objects ever undertaken. Most searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescence currently rely on detecting coincident triggers from multiple detectors. In this paper, we describe a new method for extrapolating significance of single-detector signals beyond the live-time of the analysis. Using this method, we can recover loud signals which only triggered in a single detector. We demonstrate this method in a search of O3 data, and recover seven single-detector events with a false alarm rate less than two per year. These were the same events as discovered in the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 searches in a single detector, and all but one event from 3-OGC and 4-OGC. Through a campaign of injected signals, we estimate that the total time--volume sensitivity increases by a factor of up to $1.20 \pm 0.02$ at a false alarm rate of one per two years compared to completely ignoring single-detector events.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the use of harmonic analysis techniques to perform measurements of the angular power spectrum on mock pulsar timing data for an isotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a dimensionless strain amplitude $A_{\text{gw}}=2 \times 10^{-15}$ and spectral index $\gamma_{\text{gw}}=13/3$. We examine the sensitivity of our harmonic analysis to the number of pulsars (50, 100, and 150) and length of pulsar observation time (10, 20, and 30 years) for an isotropic distribution of pulsars. We account for intrinsic pulsar red noise and use an average value of white noise of ~100 ns. We are able to detect the quadrupole for all our mock harmonic analyses, and for the analysis with 150 pulsars observed for 30 years, we are able to detect up to the $\ell = 5$ multipole. We provide scaling laws for the SGWB amplitude, the quadrupole, and $\ell = 3$ as a function of pulsar observation time and as a function of number of pulsars. We estimate the sensitivity of our harmonic approach to deviations of general relativity that produce subluminal gravitational wave propagation speeds.</description>

      <title>First constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by neutron star binaries probe the physics of matter at supra nuclear densities. During the late inspiral, tidal deformations raised on each star by the gravitational field of its companion depend crucially on the star's internal properties. The misalignment of a star's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the strength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the gravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary neutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on the dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint, \emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an order of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\zeta$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\zeta \lesssim 10^{31} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\eta \lesssim 10^{28} \mathrm{g}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{s}^{-1} $. We forecast that these bounds could be improved by two orders of magnitude with third-generation detectors, like Cosmic Explorer, using inspiral data. These constraints already inform nuclear physics models and motivate further theoretical work to better understand the interplay between viscosity and temperature in the late inspiral of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative tidal interactions can be used to probe the out-of-equilibrium physics of neutron stars using gravitational wave observations. In this paper, we present the first post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the orbital dynamics of a binary system containing objects whose tidal interactions have a dissipative contribution. We derive the 1PN-accurate equations of motion in the center-of-mass frame and a generalized energy-balance law that is valid for dissipative tidal interactions. We show how mass and energy loss due to the absorption of orbital energy change the orbital dynamics and derive the next-to-leading order correction to the gravitational wave phase of a binary system in a quasi-circular orbit containing initially non-spinning components. We then use this waveform model to constrain, for the first time, the individual dissipative tidal deformabilities of each of the binary components that generated the GW170817 event using real data. We find that the GW170817 data requires $\Xi_{1} \lesssim 1121$ and $\Xi_{2} \lesssim 1692$ at 90\% confidence, where $\Xi_{1,2}$ are the individual tidal deformabilities of the primary and secondary binary components that produced the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle from the Regularized Self-Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Schr\"odinger--Newton equation to calculate the regularized self-energy of the particle using a regular self-gravitational and electrostatic potential derived in the string T-duality. The particle mass $M$ is no longer concentrated into a point but it is diluted and described by a quantum-corrected smeared energy density resulting in corrections to the energy of the particle which is interpreted as a regularized self-energy. We extend our results and find corrections to the relativistic particles using the Klein-Gordon, Proca, and Dirac equations. An important finding is that we extract a form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) from the corrected energy. The form of GUP is shown to depend on the nature of particles; namely, for bosons (spin $0$ and spin $1$) we obtain a quadratic form of GUP, while for fermions (spin $1/2$) we obtain a linear form of GUP. The correlation we found between spin and GUP may offer insights into investigating quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Weyl conformal geometry vs Weyl anomaly</title>

Abstract: Weyl conformal geometry is a gauge theory of scale invariance that naturally brings together the Standard Model (SM) and Einstein gravity. The SM embedding in this geometry is possible without new degrees of freedom beyond SM and Weyl geometry, while Einstein gravity is generated by the broken phase of this symmetry. This follows a Stueckelberg breaking mechanism in which the Weyl gauge boson becomes massive and decouples, as discussed in the past (arXiv:1812.08613, 1904.06596, 2104.15118). However, Weyl anomaly could break explicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We first note that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to a new differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariant formulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism that enables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather than use a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariance in $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of their derivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet term. A natural, Weyl-invariant dimensional regularisation of quantum corrections exists and Weyl gauge symmetry is then maintained and manifest at the quantum level, in $d$ dimensions. This is related to a non-trivial current of this symmetry, the divergence of which cancels the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The "usual" Weyl anomaly and Riemannian geometry are recovered in the (spontaneously) broken phase. The relation to holographic Weyl anomaly is discussed.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole compaction function from stochastic fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) with ultra-slow-roll inflation when stochastic effects are important. We use the $\Delta N$ formalism and simplify the stochastic equations with an analytical constant-roll approximation. Considering a viable inflation model, we find the spatial profile of the PBH compaction function numerically for each stochastic patch, without assumptions about Gaussianity or the radial profile. The stochastic effects that lead to an exponential tail for the density distribution also make the compaction function very spiky, unlike assumed in the literature. Naively using collapse thresholds found for smooth profiles, the PBH abundance is enhanced by up to a factor of $10^9$, and the PBH mass distribution is spread over three orders of magnitude in mass. The results point to a need to redo numerical simulations of PBH formation with spiky profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the classical Regge growth conjecture in the 4d effective field theory that results from compactifying $D$-dimensional General Relativity on a compact, Ricci-flat manifold. While the higher dimensional description is given in terms of pure Einstein gravity and the conjecture is automatically satisfied, it imposes several non-trivial constraints in the 4d spectrum. Namely, there must be either none or an infinite number of massive spin-2 modes, and the mass ratio between consecutive Kaluza-Klain spin-2 replicas is bounded by the 4d coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Explanation for the absence of secondary peaks in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <title>Smooth reheating and dark matter via non-Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how a dark sector can provide a crucial link between a vacuum-dominated early universe and the later radiation-dominated epoch. As an example, we consider a feeble axion-like coupling of dark non-Abelian gauge fields with a single inflaton. In this scenario, a dark heat bath emerges at the end of inflation. As the dark sector cools down, its gauge fields confine into composite glueball states. The reheating of the visible sector is realized through portal interactions. After confinement, discrete symmetries protect part of the glueball states that form relic dark matter, while the others keep decaying into Standard Model degrees of freedom. The dark relic abundance depends mostly on the departure from equilibrium dynamics after the phase transition, constraining the confinement scale of the dark sector. Moreover, indirect detection and Big-Bang nucleosynthesis set bounds on the scale of portal interactions. We show that in a narrow but non-vanishing region of the parameter space, the correct dark matter abundance and sufficient reheating temperature are simultaneously reached.</description>

      <title>Revisiting evolution of domain walls and their gravitational radiation with CosmoLattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the publicly available CosmoLattice code, we conduct numerical simulations of a domain wall network and the resulting gravitational waves (GWs) in a radiation-dominated Universe in the $Z_2$-symmetric scalar field model. In particular, the domain wall evolution is investigated in detail both before and after reaching the scaling regime, using the combination of numerical and theoretical methods. We demonstrate that the total area of closed walls is negligible compared to that of a single long wall stretching throughout the simulation box. Therefore, the closed walls are unlikely to have a significant impact on the overall network evolution. This is in contrast with the case of cosmic strings, where formation of loops is crucial for maintaining the system in the scaling regime. To obtain the GW spectrum, we develop a technique that separates physical effects from numerical artefacts arising due to finite box size and non-zero lattice spacing. Our results on the GW spectrum agree well with Refs. [29, 30], which use different codes. Notably, we observe a peak at the Hubble scale, an exponential falloff at scales shorter than the wall width, and a plateau/bump at intermediate scales. We also study sensitivity of obtained results on the choice of initial conditions. We find that different types of initial conditions lead to qualitatively similar domain wall evolution in the scaling regime, but with important variations translating into different intensities of GWs.</description>

      <title>In LIGO's Sight? Vigorous Coherent Gravitational Waves from Cooled Collapsar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first numerical study of gravitational waves (GWs) from collapsar disks, using state-of-the-art 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars. These simulations incorporate a fixed Kerr metric for the central black hole (BH) and employ simplified prescriptions for disk cooling. We find that cooled disks with an expected scale height ratio of $H/R\gtrsim0.1$ at $\sim10$ gravitational radii induce Rossby instability in compact, high-density rings. The trapped Rossby vortices generate vigorous coherent emission regardless of disk magnetization and BH spin. For BH mass of $\sim10\,M_\odot$, the GW spectrum peaks at $\sim100\,{\rm Hz}$ with some breadth due to various nonaxisymmetric modes. The spectrum shifts toward lower frequencies as the disk viscously spreads and the circularization radius of the infalling gas increases. Weaker-cooled disks with $H/R\gtrsim0.3$ form a low-density extended structure of spiral arms, resulting in a broader, lower-amplitude spectrum. Assuming an optimistic detection threshold with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 20 and a rate similar to Type Ib/c supernovae, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) could detect $\lesssim1$ event annually, suggesting that GW events may already be hidden in observed data. Third-generation GW detectors could detect dozens to hundreds of collapsar disks annually, depending on the cooling strength and the disk formation rate. The GW amplitudes from collapsar disks are $\gtrsim100$ times higher with a substantially greater event rate than those from core-collapse supernovae, making them potentially the most promising burst-type GW class for LVK and Cosmic Explorer. This highlights the importance of further exploration and modeling of disk-powered GWs, promising insights into collapsing star physics.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological emergent dark energy in the light of DESI Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript revisits the phenomenological emergent dark energy model (PEDE) by confronting it with recent cosmological data from early and late times. In particular we analyze PEDE model by using the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements coming from both Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) data release 1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Additionally, the measurements from cosmic chronometers, supernovae type Ia (Pantheon+), quasars, hydrogen II galaxies and cosmic background radiation distance priors are considered. By performing a Bayesian analysis based on Monte Carlo Markov Chain, we find consistent results on the constraints when SDSS and DESI are considered. However, we find higher values on the Hubble constant than Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State (SH0ES) does although it is still in agreement, within $1\sigma$ confidence level, when BAO measurements are added. Furthermore, we estimate the age of the Universe younger $\sim3\%$ than the one predicted by the standard cosmology. Additionally, we report values of $q_0 = -0.771^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$, $z_T = 0.764^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ for the deceleration parameter today and the deceleration-acceleration transition redshift, respectively. However, PEDE cosmology is disfavoured by the combined samples.</description>

      <title>String Scattering and Evolution of Ryu-Takayanagi Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to illustrate that the process of open string scattering corresponds to the evolution of the entanglement wedge, where the scattering distance is identified as the entanglement wedge cross-section. Moreover, open-closed string scattering, specifically the disk-disk interaction, works for the evolution of the reflected entanglement wedge, with the circumference of the waist cross-section equating to the reflected entropy. It therefore provides evidence for the deep connections between the string worldsheet and the Ryu-Takayanagi surface. This connection is not only a coincidence rooted in hyperbolic geometry; it also reflects an additional correspondence between two distinct theories: mutual information and the geometric BV master equation.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Deformations of (Semi-)Symmetric Space Sigma Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>

      <title>Cosmological gravity on all scales IV: 3x2pt Fisher forecasts for pixelised phenomenological modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stage IV large scale structure surveys are promising probes of gravity on cosmological scales. Due to the vast model-space in the modified gravity literature, model-independent parameterisations represent useful and scalable ways to test extensions of $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we use a recently validated approach of computing the non-linear $3\times 2$pt observables in modified gravity models with a time-varying effective gravitational constant $\mu$ and a gravitational slip $\eta$ that is binned in redshift to produce Fisher forecasts for an LSST Y10-like survey. We also include in our modelling an effective nulling scheme for weak-lensing by applying the BNT transformation that localises the weak-lensing kernel enabling well-informed scale cuts. We show that the combination of improved non-linear modelling and better control of the scales that are modelled/cut yields high precision constraints on the cosmological and modified gravity parameters. We find that 4 redshift bins for $\mu$ of width corresponding to equal incremental $\Lambda$CDM growth is optimal given the state-of-the-art modelling and show how the BNT transformation can be used to mitigate the impact of small-scale systematic effects, such as baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>Charting the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Sky with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the summer of 2023, the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) announced a compelling evidence for the existence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Despite this breakthrough, however, several critical questions remain unanswered: What is the source of the signal? How can cosmic variance be accounted for? To what extent can we constrain nanohertz gravity? When will individual supermassive black hole binaries become observable? And how can we achieve a stronger detection? These open questions have spurred significant interests in PTA science, making this an opportune moment to revisit the astronomical and theoretical foundations of the field, as well as the data analysis techniques employed. In this review, we focus on the theoretical aspects of the SGWB as detected by PTAs. We provide a comprehensive derivation of the expected signal and its correlation, presented in a pedagogical manner, while also addressing current constraints. Looking ahead, we explore future milestones in the field, with detailed discussions on emerging theoretical considerations such as cosmic variance, the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions, subluminal gravitational waves, and the anisotropy and polarization of the SGWB.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Primordial Black Hole Abundance through Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Advanced LIGO and Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ are supposed to have evaporated by today through Hawking radiation. This scenario is challenged by the memory burden effect, which suggests that the evaporation of black holes may slow down significantly after they have emitted about half of their initial mass. We explore the astrophysical implications of the memory burden effect on the PBH abundance by today and the possibility for PBHs lighter than $\sim10^{-18}M_{\odot}$ to persist as dark matter. Our analysis utilizes current LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data to constrain the primordial power spectrum and infer the PBH abundance. We find a null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves that accompanied the formation of the PBHs. Then we find that PBHs are ruled out within the mass range $\sim[10^{-24},10^{-19}]M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, we expect that next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer, will provide even more stringent constraints. Our results indicate that future detectors can reach sensitivities that could rule out PBH as dark matter within $\sim[10^{-29}M_{\odot},10^{-16}M_{\odot}]$ in the null detection of scalar-induced gravitational waves.</description>
