      <title>Weak Independence and Coupled Parallelism in Biological Petri Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Biological Petri Nets (Bio-PNs) model biochemical pathways where multiple reactions simultaneously affect shared metabolites through convergent production or regulatory coupling. However, classical Petri net independence theory requires transitions to share no places -- a constraint that fails to capture biological reality. This mismatch prevents parallel simulation and incorrectly flags biologically valid models as structurally problematic.
  Results: To resolve this fundamental limitation, we introduce weak independence -- a novel formalization distinguishing resource conflicts from biological coupling. Building on this theory, we extend the Bio-PN definition from a classical 5-tuple to a 12-tuple by adding regulatory structure, environmental exchange classification, dependency taxonomy, heterogeneous transition types, and biochemical formula tracking. This extended formalism enables systematic classification of three place-sharing modes: competitive (conflict), convergent (superposition), and regulatory (read-only). Validating our approach on 100 diverse BioModels (1,775 species, 2,234 reactions across metabolism, signaling, and gene regulation), we find that 96.93% of transition pairs exhibit weak independence -- confirming that biological networks inherently favor cooperation over competition. Our SHYpn implementation demonstrates the practical impact, achieving up to 2.6x speedup on 30% of evaluated models.

      <title>DiffeoMorph: Learning to Morph 3D Shapes Using Differentiable Agent-Based Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems can form complex three-dimensional structures through the collective behavior of identical agents -- cells that follow the same internal rules and communicate without central control. How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.</description>

      <title>Biosecurity-Aware AI: Agentic Risk Auditing of Soft Prompt Attacks on ESM-Based Variant Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), have demonstrated remarkable success in variant effect prediction. However, their security and robustness under adversarial manipulation remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Secure Agentic Genomic Evaluator (SAGE), an agentic framework for auditing the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs. SAGE functions through an interpretable and automated risk auditing loop. It injects soft prompt perturbations, monitors model behavior across training checkpoints, computes risk metrics such as AUROC and AUPR, and generates structured reports with large language model-based narrative explanations. This agentic process enables continuous evaluation of embedding-space robustness without modifying the underlying model. Using SAGE, we find that even state-of-the-art GFMs like ESM2 are sensitive to targeted soft prompt attacks, resulting in measurable performance degradation. These findings reveal critical and previously hidden vulnerabilities in genomic foundation models, showing the importance of agentic risk auditing in securing biomedical applications such as clinical variant interpretation.</description>

      <title>From Classical Machine Learning to Emerging Foundation Models: Review on Multimodal Data Integration for Cancer Research</title>

Abstract: Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models (FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration. We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale, pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology, while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era of large-scale AI models in cancer research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Modeling of Single-Cell transcriptomes: Capturing Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies. No existing simulator jointly models gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel quantum computing-based simulator that employs entanglement to model intra- and inter-cellular interactions, generating realistic single-cell transcriptomes with cellular heterogeneity. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) as well as cell-cell communication topologies with explicit causal directionality. The resulting synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies: standard correlation-based analyses (Pearson and Spearman) fail to recover the programmed causal pathways and instead report spurious associations driven by high baseline gene-expression probabilities. Furthermore, applying cell-cell communication detection to the simulated data validates the true mechanistic links, revealing a robust, up to 75-fold relative increase in inferred communication probability only when quantum entanglement is active. These results demonstrate that the quantum kernel is essential for producing high-fidelity ground-truth datasets and highlight the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>On the performance of multi-fidelity and reduced-dimensional neural emulators for inference of physiological boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11683</link>

Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.</description>
