      <title>Possibility Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional semantics for classical logic and its extensions, such as modal logic, propositions are interpreted as subsets of a set, as in discrete duality, or as clopen sets of a Stone space, as in topological duality. A point in such a set can be viewed as a "possible world," with the key property of a world being primeness--a world makes a disjunction true only if it makes one of the disjuncts true--which classically implies totality--for each proposition, a world either makes the proposition true or makes its negation true. This chapter surveys a more general approach to logical semantics, known as possibility semantics, which replaces possible worlds with possibly partial "possibilities." In classical possibility semantics, propositions are interpreted as regular open sets of a poset, as in set-theoretic forcing, or as compact regular open sets of an upper Vietoris space, as in the recent theory of "choice-free Stone duality." The elements of these sets, viewed as possibilities, may be partial in the sense of making a disjunction true without settling which disjunct is true. We explain how possibilities may be used in semantics for classical logic and modal logics and generalized to semantics for intuitionistic logics. The goals are to overcome or deepen incompleteness results for traditional semantics, to avoid the nonconstructivity of traditional semantics, and to provide richer structures for the interpretation of new languages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arranging the bits of a random string or real into k columns of a two-dimensional array or higher dimensional structure is typically accompanied with loss in the Kolmogorov complexity of the columns, which depends on k. We quantify and characterize this phenomenon for arrays and trees and its relationship to negligible classes.</description>

      <title>Definable compactness in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the notion of definable compactness for topological spaces definable in o-minimal structures, answering questions of Peterzil and Steinhorn (1999) and Johnson (2018). Specifically, we prove the equivalence of various definitions of definable compactness in the literature, including those in terms of definable curves, definable types and definable downward directed families of closed sets.</description>

      <title>Definable separability and second-countability in o-minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that separability and second-countability are first-order properties among topological spaces definable in o-minimal expansions of $(\mathbb{R},&lt;)$. We do so by introducing first-order characterizations -- definable separability and definable second-countability -- which make sense in a wider model-theoretic context. We prove that within o-minimality these notions have the desired properties, including their equivalence among definable metric spaces, and conjecture a definable version of Urysohn's Metrization Theorem.</description>

      <title>Primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank and affine type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a review of one of the lines in development of the theory of groups of finite Morley rank. These groups naturally appear in model theory as model-theoretic analogues of Galois groups, therefore their actions and their role as permutation groups is of primary interest. We restrict our story to the study of connected groups of finite Morley rank $G$ acting in a definably primitive way on a set $X$ and containing a definable abelian normal subgroup $V$ which acts on $X$ regularly -- the so-called \emph{primitive groups of affine type}. For reasons explained in the paper, this case plays a central role in the theory.</description>

      <title>A cyclic proof system for Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT for short) is an efficient fragment of Kleene Algebra with Tests, suitable for reasoning about simple imperative while-programs. Following earlier work by Das and Pous on Kleene Algebra, we study GKAT from a proof-theoretical perspective. The deterministic nature of GKAT allows for a non-well-founded sequent system whose set of regular proofs is complete with respect to the guarded language model. This is unlike the situation with Kleene Algebra, where hypersequents are required. Moreover, the decision procedure induced by proof search runs in NLOGSPACE, whereas that of Kleene Algebra is in PSPACE.</description>

      <title>On automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\lambda)/[\lambda]^{&lt;\lambda}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the statement ``all automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\lambda)/[\lambda]^{&lt;\lambda}$ are trivial''. We show that MA implies the statement for regular uncountable $\lambda&lt;2^{\aleph_0}$; that the statement is false for measurable $\lambda$ if $2^\lambda=\lambda^+$; and that for ``densely trivial'' it can be forced (together with $2^\lambda=\lambda^{++}$) for inaccessible $\lambda$.</description>

      <title>State-based Modal Logics for Free Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mathematical properties of bilateral state-based modal logic (BSML), a modal logic employing state-based semantics (also known as team semantics), which has been used to account for free choice inferences and related linguistic phenomena. This logic extends classical modal logic with a nonemptiness atom which is true in a state if and only if the state is nonempty. We introduce two extensions of BSML and show that the extensions are expressively complete, and develop natural deduction axiomatizations for the three logics.</description>

      <title>On countable isotypic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain several results concerning the concept of isotypic structures. Namely we prove that any field of finite transcendence degree over a prime subfield is defined by types; then we construct isotypic but not isomorphic structures with countable underlying sets: totally ordered sets, fields, and groups. This answers an old question by B. Plotkin for groups.</description>

      <title>Wetzel families and the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide answers to a question brought up by Erd\H{o}s about the construction of Wetzel families in the absence of the continuum hypothesis - a Wetzel family is a family $\mathcal{F}$ of entire functions on the complex plane which pointwise assumes fewer than $\vert \mathcal{F} \vert$ values. To be more precise, we show that the existence of a Wetzel family is consistent with all possible values $\kappa$ of the continuum and, if $\kappa$ is regular, also with Martin's Axiom. In the particular case of $\kappa = \aleph_2$ this answers an open question asked by Kumar and Shelah. In the buildup to this result, we are also solving an open question of Zapletal on strongly almost disjoint functions. We also study a strongly related notion of sets exhibiting a universality property via mappings by entire functions and show that these consistently exist while the continuum equals $\aleph_2$.</description>

      <title>The Pebble-Relation Comonad in Finite Model Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pebbling comonad, introduced by Abramsky, Dawar and Wang, provides a categorical interpretation for the k-pebble games from finite model theory. The coKleisli category of the pebbling comonad specifies equivalences under different fragments and extensions of infinitary k-variable logic. Moreover, the coalgebras over this pebbling comonad characterise treewidth and correspond to tree decompositions. In this paper we introduce the pebble-relation comonad, which characterises pathwidth and whose coalgebras correspond to path decompositions. We further show that the existence of a coKleisli morphism in this comonad is equivalent to truth preservation in the restricted conjunction fragment of k-variable infinitary logic. We do this using Dalmau's pebble-relation game and an equivalent all-in-one pebble game. We then provide a similar treatment to the corresponding coKleisli isomorphisms via a bijective version of the all-in-one pebble game. Finally, we show as a consequence a new Lov\'asz-type theorem relating pathwidth to the restricted conjunction fragment of k-variable infinitary logic with counting quantifiers.</description>
