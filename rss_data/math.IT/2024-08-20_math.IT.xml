      <title>Identification via Gaussian Multiple Access Channels in the Presence of Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate message identification over a K-sender Gaussian multiple access channel (K-GMAC). Unlike conventional Shannon transmission codes, the size of randomized identification (ID) codes experiences a doubly exponential growth in the code length. Improvements in the ID approach can be attained through additional resources such as quantum entanglement, common randomness (CR), and feedback. It has been demonstrated that an infinite capacity can be attained for a single-user Gaussian channel with noiseless feedback, irrespective of the chosen rate scaling. We establish the capacity region of both the K-sender Gaussian multiple access channel (K-GMAC) and the K-sender state-dependent Gaussian multiple access channel (K-SD-GMAC) when strictly causal noiseless feedback is available.</description>

      <title>On Binary Shadow Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the shadow codes of Cherubini and Micheli to include basic polynomials having arbitrary degree, and show that restricting basic polynomials to have degree one or less can result in improved code parameters. The resulting codes improve upon the well-known Delsarte-Goethals codes only in the regime of extremely long block lengths ($\geq 2^{20}$, say), and so are likely to be of practical interest only for very noisy channels.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Enhancing Privacy-Utility Tradeoff in the Privacy Funnel and Other Lift-based Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the privacy funnel, a privacy-utility tradeoff problem in which mutual information quantifies both privacy and utility. The objective is to maximize utility while adhering to a specified privacy budget. However, the privacy funnel represents a non-convex optimization problem, making it challenging to achieve an optimal solution. An existing proposed approach to this problem involves substituting the mutual information with the lift (the exponent of information density) and then solving the optimization. Since mutual information is the expectation of the information density, this substitution overestimates the privacy loss and results in a final smaller bound on the privacy of mutual information than what is allowed in the budget. This significantly compromises the utility. To overcome this limitation, we propose using a privacy measure that is more relaxed than the lift but stricter than mutual information while still allowing the optimization to be efficiently solved. Instead of directly using information density, our proposed measure is the average of information density over the sensitive data distribution for each observed data realization. We then introduce a heuristic algorithm capable of achieving solutions that produce extreme privacy values, which enhances utility. The numerical results confirm improved utility at the same privacy budget compared to existing solutions in the literature. Additionally, we explore two other privacy measures, $\ell_{1}$-norm and strong $\chi^2$-divergence, demonstrating the applicability of our algorithm to these lift-based measures. We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing its output with previous works. Finally, we validate our heuristic approach with a theoretical framework that estimates the optimal utility for strong $\chi^2$-divergence, numerically showing a perfect match.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triorthogonal matrices were introduced in Quantum Information Theory in connection with distillation of magic states (Bravyi and Haah (2012)). We give an algorithm to construct binary triorthogonal matrices from binary self-dual codes. Further, we generalize to this setting the classical coding techniques of shortening and extending. We also give some simple propagation rules.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Multiple Access: A Coding Paradigm for Massive Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a tutorial introduction to the field of unsourced multiple access (UMAC) protocols. We first provide a historical survey of the evolution of random access protocols, focusing specifically on the case in which uncoordinated users share a wireless broadcasting medium. Next, we highlight the change of perspective originated by the UMAC model, in which the physical and medium access layer's protocols cooperate, thus reframing random access as a novel coding-theoretic problem. By now, a large variety of UMAC protocols (codes) emerged, necessitating a certain classification that we indeed propose here. Although some random access schemes require a radical change of the physical layer, others can be implemented with minimal changes to existing industry standards. As an example, we discuss a simple modification to the 5GNR Release 16 random access channel that builds on the UMAC theory and that dramatically improves energy efficiency for systems with even moderate number of simultaneous users (e.g., $5-10$ dB gain for $10-50$ users), and also enables handling of high number of users, something completely out of reach of the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Optimal Few-GHW Linear Codes and Their Subcode Support Weight Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-weight codes have been constructed and studied for many years, since their fascinating relations to finite geometries, strongly regular graphs and Boolean functions. Simplex codes are one-weight Griesmer $[\frac{q^k-1}{q-1},k ,q^{k-1}]_q$-linear codes and they meet all Griesmer bounds of the generalized Hamming weights of linear codes. All the subcodes with dimension $r$ of a $[\frac{q^k-1}{q-1},k ,q^{k-1}]_q$-simplex code have the same subcode support weight $\frac{q^{k-r}(q^r-1)}{q-1}$ for $1\leq r\leq k$. In this paper, we construct linear codes meeting the Griesmer bound of the $r$-generalized Hamming weight, such codes do not meet the Griesmer bound of the $j$-generalized Hamming weight for $1\leq j&lt;r$. Moreover these codes have only few subcode support weights. The weight distribution and the subcode support weight distributions of these distance-optimal codes are determined. Linear codes constructed in this paper are natural generalizations of distance-optimal few-weight codes.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) have recently emerged as a promising technology, which can realize transmit precoding in the wave domain. In this paper, we investigate a SIM-aided integrated sensing and communications system, in which SIM is capable of generating a desired beam pattern for simultaneously communicating with multiple downlink users and detecting a radar target. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the spectrum efficiency, while satisfying the power constraint of the desired direction. This requires jointly designing the phase shifts of the SIM and the power allocation at the base station. By incorporating the sensing power constraint into the objective functions as a penalty term, we further simplify the optimization problem and solve it by customizing an efficient gradient ascent algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed wave-domain precoder for automatically mitigating the inter-user interference and generating a desired beampattern for the sensing task, as multiple separate data streams transmit through the SIM.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Progress Measures reveal Grokking is an Emergent Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies emergent phenomena in neural networks by focusing on grokking where models suddenly generalize after delayed memorization. To understand this phase transition, we utilize higher-order mutual information to analyze the collective behavior (synergy) and shared properties (redundancy) between neurons during training. We identify distinct phases before grokking allowing us to anticipate when it occurs. We attribute grokking to an emergent phase transition caused by the synergistic interactions between neurons as a whole. We show that weight decay and weight initialization can enhance the emergent phase.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Good Quantum Codes with Transversal Non-Clifford Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct quantum codes that support transversal $CCZ$ gates over qudits of arbitrary prime power dimension $q$ (including $q=2$) such that the code dimension and distance grow linearly in the block length. The only previously known construction with such linear dimension and distance required a growing alphabet size $q$ (Krishna &amp; Tillich, 2019). Our codes imply protocols for magic state distillation with overhead exponent $\gamma=\log(n/k)/\log(d)\rightarrow 0$ as the block length $n\rightarrow\infty$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the code dimension and distance respectively. It was previously an open question to obtain such a protocol with a contant alphabet size $q$.
  We construct our codes by combining two modular components, namely,
  (i) a transformation from classical codes satisfying certain properties to quantum codes supporting transversal $CCZ$ gates, and
  (ii) a concatenation scheme for reducing the alphabet size of codes supporting transversal $CCZ$ gates. For this scheme we introduce a quantum analogue of multiplication-friendly codes, which provide a way to express multiplication over a field in terms of a subfield.
  We obtain our asymptotically good construction by instantiating (i) with algebraic-geometric codes, and applying a constant number of iterations of (ii). We also give an alternative construction with nearly asymptotically good parameters ($k,d=n/2^{O(\log^*n)}$) by instantiating (i) with Reed-Solomon codes and then performing a superconstant number of iterations of (ii).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove bounds on statistical distances between high-dimensional exchangeable mixture distributions (which we call permutation mixtures) and their i.i.d. counterparts. Our results are based on a novel method for controlling $\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is tighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical level, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for elementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper bound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. Our results imply a de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and Freedman, 1987) and general asymptotic results for compound decision problems, generalizing and strengthening a result of Hannan and Robbins (1955).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental yet challenging task in data science and machine learning. This work proposes a new estimator for mutual information. Our main discovery is that a preliminary estimate of the data distribution can dramatically help estimate. This preliminary estimate serves as a bridge between the joint and the marginal distribution, and by comparing with this bridge distribution we can easily obtain the true difference between the joint distributions and the marginal distributions. Experiments on diverse tasks including non-Gaussian synthetic problems with known ground-truth and real-world applications demonstrate the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Interleaved Pilots to Extend the Region of Predictable Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the delay period of the Zak-OTFS carrier is greater than the delay spread of the channel, and the Doppler period of the carrier is greater than the Doppler spread of the channel, the effective channel filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single pilot carrier waveform. The input-output (I/O) relation can then be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. We introduce a framework for pilot design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain which makes it possible to support users with very different delay-Doppler characteristics when it is not possible to choose a single delay and Doppler period to support all users. The method is to interleave single pilots in the DD domain, and to choose the pilot spacing so that the I/O relation can be reconstructed by solving a small linear system of equations.</description>

      <title>GRLinQ: An Intelligent Spectrum Sharing Mechanism for Device-to-Device Communications with Graph Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device-to-device (D2D) spectrum sharing in wireless communications is a challenging non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, involving entangled link scheduling and power control in a large-scale network. The state-of-the-art methods, either from a model-based or a data-driven perspective, exhibit certain limitations such as the critical need for channel state information (CSI) and/or a large number of (solved) instances (e.g., network layouts) as training samples. To advance this line of research, we propose a novel hybrid model/datadriven spectrum sharing mechanism with graph reinforcement learning for link scheduling (GRLinQ), injecting information theoretical insights into machine learning models, in such a way that link scheduling and power control can be solved in an intelligent yet explainable manner. Through an extensive set of experiments, GRLinQ demonstrates superior performance to the existing model-based and data-driven link scheduling and/or power control methods, with a relaxed requirement for CSI, a substantially reduced number of unsolved instances as training samples, a possible distributed deployment, reduced online/offline computational complexity, and more remarkably excellent scalability and generalizability over different network scenarios and system configurations.</description>

      <title>Error minimization for fidelity estimation of GHZ states with arbitrary noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fidelity estimation is a crucial component for the quality control of entanglement distribution networks. This work studies a scenario in which multiple nodes share noisy Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. Due to the collapsing nature of quantum measurements, the nodes randomly sample a subset of noisy GHZ states for measurement and then estimate the average fidelity of the unsampled states conditioned on the measurement outcome. By developing a fidelity-preserving diagonalization operation, analyzing the Bloch representation of GHZ states, and maximizing the Fisher information, the proposed estimation protocol achieves the minimum mean squared estimation error in a challenging scenario characterized by arbitrary noise and the absence of prior information. Additionally, this protocol is implementation-friendly as it only uses local Pauli operators according to a predefined sequence. Numerical studies demonstrate that, compared to existing fidelity estimation protocols, the proposed protocol reduces estimation errors in both scenarios involving independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise and correlated noise.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Interpretable Transformers Using PDEs and Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel unified theoretical framework for understanding Transformer architectures by integrating Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), Neural Information Flow Theory, and Information Bottleneck Theory. We model Transformer information dynamics as a continuous PDE process, encompassing diffusion, self-attention, and nonlinear residual components. Our comprehensive experiments across image and text modalities demonstrate that the PDE model effectively captures key aspects of Transformer behavior, achieving high similarity (cosine similarity &gt; 0.98) with Transformer attention distributions across all layers. While the model excels in replicating general information flow patterns, it shows limitations in fully capturing complex, non-linear transformations. This work provides crucial theoretical insights into Transformer mechanisms, offering a foundation for future optimizations in deep learning architectural design. We discuss the implications of our findings, potential applications in model interpretability and efficiency, and outline directions for enhancing PDE models to better mimic the intricate behaviors observed in Transformers, paving the way for more transparent and optimized AI systems.</description>

      <title>Confirmation Bias in Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confirmation bias, the tendency to interpret information in a way that aligns with one's preconceptions, can profoundly impact scientific research, leading to conclusions that reflect the researcher's hypotheses even when the observational data do not support them. This issue is especially critical in scientific fields involving highly noisy observations, such as cryo-electron microscopy.
  This study investigates confirmation bias in Gaussian mixture models. We consider the following experiment: A team of scientists assumes they are analyzing data drawn from a Gaussian mixture model with known signals (hypotheses) as centroids. However, in reality, the observations consist entirely of noise without any informative structure. The researchers use a single iteration of the K-means or expectation-maximization algorithms, two popular algorithms to estimate the centroids. Despite the observations being pure noise, we show that these algorithms yield biased estimates that resemble the initial hypotheses, contradicting the unbiased expectation that averaging these noise observations would converge to zero. Namely, the algorithms generate estimates that mirror the postulated model, although the hypotheses (the presumed centroids of the Gaussian mixture) are not evident in the observations. Specifically, among other results, we prove a positive correlation between the estimates produced by the algorithms and the corresponding hypotheses. We also derive explicit closed-form expressions of the estimates for a finite and infinite number of hypotheses. This study underscores the risks of confirmation bias in low signal-to-noise environments, provides insights into potential pitfalls in scientific methodologies, and highlights the importance of prudent data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Towards a Field Based Bayesian Evidence Inference from Nested Sampling Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling (NS) is a stochastic method for computing the log-evidence of a Bayesian problem. It relies on stochastic estimates of prior volumes enclosed by likelihood contours, which limits the accuracy of the log-evidence calculation. We propose to transform the prior volume estimation into a Bayesian inference problem, which allows us to incorporate a smoothness assumption for likelihood-prior volume relations. As a result, we aim to increase the accuracy of the volume estimates and thus improve the overall log-evidence calculation using NS. The method presented works as a post-processing step for NS and provides posterior samples of the likelihood-prior-volume relation, from which the log-evidence can be calculated. We demonstrate an implementation of the algorithm and compare its results with plain NS on two synthetic datasets for which the underlying evidence is known. We find a significant improvement in accuracy for runs with less than one hundred active samples in NS, but are prone to numerical problems beyond this point.</description>

      <title>Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes and their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new variant of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed variant of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</description>

      <title>ProductAE: Toward Deep Learning Driven Error-Correction Codes of Large Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While decades of theoretical research have led to the invention of several classes of error-correction codes, the design of such codes is an extremely challenging task, mostly driven by human ingenuity. Recent studies demonstrate that such designs can be effectively automated and accelerated via tools from machine learning (ML), thus enabling ML-driven classes of error-correction codes with promising performance gains compared to classical designs. A fundamental challenge, however, is that it is prohibitively complex, if not impossible, to design and train fully ML-driven encoder and decoder pairs for large code dimensions. In this paper, we propose Product Autoencoder (ProductAE) -- a computationally-efficient family of deep learning driven (encoder, decoder) pairs -- aimed at enabling the training of relatively large codes (both encoder and decoder) with a manageable training complexity. We build upon ideas from classical product codes and propose constructing large neural codes using smaller code components. ProductAE boils down the complex problem of training the encoder and decoder for a large code dimension $k$ and blocklength $n$ to less-complex sub-problems of training encoders and decoders for smaller dimensions and blocklengths. Our training results show successful training of ProductAEs of dimensions as large as $k = 300$ bits with meaningful performance gains compared to state-of-the-art classical and neural designs. Moreover, we demonstrate excellent robustness and adaptivity of ProductAEs to channel models different than the ones used for training.</description>

      <title>Distributed Precoding for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks Without Sharing CSIT: A Rate-Splitting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06325v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs) are promising architecture for providing global coverage. In STINs, full frequency reuse between a satellite and a terrestrial base station (BS) is encouraged for aggressive spectrum reuse, which induces non-negligible amount of interference. To address the interference management problem in STINs, this paper proposes a novel distributed precoding method. Key features of our method are: i) a rate-splitting (RS) strategy is incorporated for efficient interference management and ii) the precoders are designed in a distributed way without sharing channel state information between a satellite and a terrestrial BS. Specifically, to design the precoders in a distributed fashion, we put forth a spectral efficiency decoupling technique, that disentangles the total spectral efficiency function into two distinct terms, each of which is dependent solely on the satellite's precoder and the terrestrial BS's precoder, respectively. Then, to resolve the non-smoothness raised by the RS strategy, we approximate the spectral efficiency expression as a smooth function by using the LogSumExp technique; thereafter we develop a generalized power iteration inspired optimization algorithm built based on the first-order optimality condition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method offers considerable spectral efficiency gains compared to the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Capacity Maximization for FAS-assisted Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a multiuser millimeter-wave (mmWave) uplink system in which each user is equipped with a multi-antenna fluid antenna system (FAS) while the base station (BS) has multiple fixed-position antennas. Our primary objective is to maximize the system capacity by optimizing the transmit covariance matrices and the antenna position vectors of the users jointly. To gain insights, we start by deriving upper bounds and approximations for the capacity. Then we delve into the capacity maximization problem. Beginning with the simple scenario of a single user equipped with a single-antenna FAS, we demonstrate that a closed-form optimal solution exists when there are only two propagation paths between the user and the BS. In the case where multiple propagation paths are present, a near-optimal solution can also be obtained through a one-dimensional search method. Expanding our focus to multiuser cases, in which users are equipped with either single- or multi-antenna FAS, we show that the original capacity maximization problems can be reformulated into distinct rank-one programmings. Then, we propose alternating optimization algorithms to deal with the transformed problems. Simulation results indicate that FAS can improve the capacity of the multiple access channel (MAC) greatly, and the proposed algorithms outperform all the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Towards Near-Field 3D Spot Beamfocusing: Possibilities, Challenges, and Use-cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spot beamfocusing (SBF) is the process of focusing the signal power in a small spot-like region in the 3D space, which can be either hard-tuned (HT) using traditional tools like lenses and mirrors or electronically reconfigured (ER) using modern large-scale intelligent surface phased arrays. ER-SBF can be a key enabling technology (KET) for the next-generation 6G wireless networks offering benefits to many future wireless application areas such as wireless communication and security, mid-range high-power and safe wireless chargers, medical and health, physics, etc. Although near-field HT-SBF and ER-beamfocusing have been studied in the literature and applied in the industry, there is no comprehensive study of different aspects of ER-SBF and its future applications, especially for nonoptical (mmWave, sub-THz, and THz) electromagnetic waves in the next generation wireless technology, which is the aim of this paper. The theoretical concepts behind ER-SBF, different antenna technologies for implementing ER-SBF, employing machine learning (ML)-based schemes for enabling channel-state-information (CSI)-independent ER-SBF, and different practical application areas that can benefit from ER-SBF will be explored.</description>

      <title>The Markov-Chain Polytope with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding a minimum-cost $m$-state Markov chain $(S_0,\ldots,S_{m-1})$ in a large set of chains. The chains studied have a reward associated with each state. The cost of a chain is its "gain", i.e., its average reward under its stationary distribution.
  Specifically, for each $k=0,\ldots,m-1$ there is a known set ${\mathbb S}_k$ of type-$k$ states. A permissible Markov chain contains exactly one state of each type; the problem is to find a minimum-cost permissible chain.
  The original motivation was to find a cheapest binary AIFV-$m$ lossless code on a source alphabet of size $n$. Such a code is an $m$-tuple of trees, in which each tree can be viewed as a Markov Chain state. This formulation was then used to address other problems in lossless compression. The known solution techniques for finding minimum-cost Markov chains were iterative and ran in exponential time.
  This paper shows how to map every possible type-$k$ state into a type-$k$ hyperplane and then define a "Markov Chain Polytope" as the lower envelope of all such hyperplanes. Finding a minimum-cost Markov chain can then be shown to be equivalent to finding a "highest" point on this polytope.
  The local optimization procedures used in the previous iterative algorithms are shown to be separation oracles for this polytope. Since these were often polynomial time, an application of the Ellipsoid method immediately leads to polynomial time algorithms for these problems.</description>

      <title>Indirect Lossy Source Coding with Observed Source Reconstruction: Nonasymptotic Bounds and Second-Order Asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the joint compression of a pair of correlated sources, where the encoder is allowed to access only one of the sources. The objective is to recover both sources under separate distortion constraints for each source while minimizing the rate. This problem generalizes the indirect lossy source coding problem by also requiring the recovery of the observed source. In this paper, we aim to study the nonasymptotic and second-order asymptotic properties of this problem. Specifically, we begin by deriving nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds valid for general sources and distortion measures. The source dispersion (Gaussian approximation) is then determined through asymptotic analysis of the nonasymptotic bounds. We further examine the case of erased fair coin flips (EFCF) and provide its specific nonasymptotic achievability and converse bounds. Numerical results under the EFCF case demonstrate that our second-order asymptotic approximation closely approximates the optimum rate at appropriately large blocklengths.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Sum-Rate Maximization Algorithm for Fluid Antenna-Assisted ISAC System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter investigates a fluid antenna (FA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, with joint antenna position optimization and waveform design. We consider enhancing the sum-rate maximization (SRM) and sensing performance with the aid of FAs. Although the introduction of FAs brings more degrees of freedom for performance optimization, its position optimization poses a non-convex programming problem and brings great computational challenges. This letter contributes to building an efficient design algorithm by the block successive upper bound minimization and majorization-minimization principles, with each step admitting closed-form update for the ISAC waveform design. In addition, the extrapolation technique is exploited further to speed up the empirical convergence of FA position design. Simulation results show that the proposed design can achieve state-of-the-art sum-rate performance with at least 60% computation cutoff compared to existing works with successive convex approximation (SCA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping Index Modulation Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) significantly enhances the spectral efficiency of fluid antennas (FAs) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is named FA-IM. However, due to the dense distribution of ports on the FA, the wireless channel exhibits a high spatial correlation, leading to severe performance degradation in the existing FA-IM-assisted MIMO systems. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel fluid antenna grouping index modulation (FA-GIM) scheme to mitigate the high correlation between the activated ports. Specifically, considering the characteristics of the FA two-dimensional (2D) surface structure and the spatially correlated channel model in FA-assisted MIMO systems, a block grouping method is adopted, where adjacent ports are assigned to the same group. Consequently, different groups independently perform port index selection and constellation symbol mapping, with only one port being activated within each group during each transmission interval. Then, a closed-form average bit error probability (ABEP) upper bound for the proposed scheme is derived. Numerical results show that, compared to state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed FA-GIM scheme consistently achieves significant bit error rate (BER) performance gains under various conditions. The proposed scheme is both efficient and robust, enhancing the performance of FA-assisted MIMO systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for generic decoding of convolutional codes, which allows us to do cryptanalysis of code-based systems that use convolutional codes. We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 60 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the demand for wireless connectivity continues to soar, the fifth generation and beyond wireless networks are exploring new ways to efficiently utilize the wireless spectrum and reduce hardware costs. One such approach is the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly access the spectrum. Recent ISAC studies have focused on upper millimeter-wave and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies, hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture, which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC beamformers by first estimating both radar and communications parameters by developing beam-split-aware algorithms. Then, we propose to employ a family of hybrid beamforming techniques such as hybrid, SI, and subcarrier-dependent analog-only, and beam-split-aware beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed SPIM-ISAC approach exhibits significantly improved spectral efficiency performance in the presence of beam-split than that of even fully digital non-SPIM beamformers.</description>

      <title>Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): the development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine their relationship in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of "intelligence", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by average benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a novel and practical next-generation cellular network where two modes of semantic communication (SemCom) and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist, namely hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we comprehensively develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with several practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by employing a Lagrange primal-dual method and devising a preference list-based heuristic algorithm. Finally, numerical results validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>
