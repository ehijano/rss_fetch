      <title>Bicombing the mapping class group and Teichm\"uller space via stable cubical intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this mostly expository article, we provide a new account of our proof with Minsky and Sisto that mapping class groups and Teichm\"uller spaces admit bicombings. More generally, we explain how the hierarchical hull of a pair of points in any colorable hierarchically hyperbolic space is quasi-isometric to a finite CAT(0) cube complex of bounded dimension, with the added property that perturbing the pair of points results in a uniformly bounded change to the cubical structure. Our approach is simplified and new in many aspects.</description>

      <title>Instanton 2-torsion and fibered knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the unreduced singular instanton homology $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{Z})$ has $2$-torsion for any null-homologous fibered knot $K$ of genus $g&gt;0$ in a closed $3$-manifold $Y$ except for $\#^{2g}S^1\times S^2$. The main technical result is a formula of $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{C})$ via sutured instanton theory, by which we can compare the dimensions of $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $I^\sharp(Y,K;\mathbb{C})$. As a byproduct, we show that $I^\sharp(S^3,K;\mathbb{C})$ for a knot $K\subset S^3$ admitting lens space surgeries is determined by the Alexander polynomial, while some special cases of torus knots have been previously studied by many people. Another byproduct is that the next-to-top Alexander grading summand of instanton knot homology $KHI(S^3,K,g(K)-1)$ is non-vanishing when $K$ has unknotting number one, which generalizes the Baldwin--Sivek's result in the fibered case. Finally, we discuss the relation to the Heegaard Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Property (T) and Poincar\'e duality in dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a recent result of Bader and Sauer on coboundary expansion to prove residually finite three-dimensional Poincar\'e duality groups never have property (T). This implies such groups are never K\"ahler. The argument applies to fundamental groups of (possibly non-aspherical) compact 3-manifolds, giving a new proof of a theorem of Fujiwara that states if the fundamental group of a compact 3-manifold has property (T), then that group is finite. The only consequence of geometrization needed in the proof is that 3-manifold groups are residually finite.</description>

      <title>Manifold classification from the descriptive viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider classification problems for manifolds and discrete subgroups of Lie groups from a descriptive set-theoretic point of view. This work is largely foundational in conception and character, recording both a framework for general study and Borel complexity computations for some of the most fundamental classes of manifolds. We show, for example, that for all $n\geq 0$, the homeomorphism problem for compact topological $n$-manifolds is Borel equivalent to the relation $=_{\mathbb{N}}$ of equality on the natural numbers, while the homeomorphism problem for noncompact topological $2$-manifolds is of maximal complexity among equivalence relations classifiable by countable structures. A nontrivial step in the latter consists of proving Borel measurable formulations of the Jordan--Schoenflies and surface triangulation theorems. Turning our attention to groups and geometric structures, we show, strengthening results of Stuck--Zimmer and Andretta--Camerlo--Hjorth, that the conjugacy relation on discrete subgroups of any noncompact semisimple Lie group is essentially countable universal. So too, as a corollary, is the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds for any $n\geq 2$, generalizing a result of Hjorth--Kechris. We then show that the isometry relation for complete hyperbolic $n$-manifolds with finitely generated fundamental group is, in contrast, Borel equivalent to the equality relation $=_{\mathbb{R}}$ on the real numbers when $n=2$, but that it is not concretely classifiable when $n=3$; thus there exists no Borel assignment of numerical complete invariants to finitely generated Kleinian groups up to conjugacy. We close with a survey of the most immediate open questions.</description>

      <title>Knot surgery formulae for instanton Floer homology II: applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a companion paper to earlier work of the authors, which proved an integral surgery formula for framed instanton homology. First, we present an enhancement of the large surgery formula, a rational surgery formula for null-homologous knots in any 3-manifold, and a formula encoding a large portion of $I^\sharp(S^3_0(K))$. Second, we use the integral surgery formula to study the framed instanton homology of many 3-manifolds: Seifert fibered spaces with nonzero orbifold degrees, especially nontrivial circle bundles over any orientable surface, surgeries on a family of alternating knots and all twisted Whitehead doubles, and splicings with twist knots. Finally, we use the previous techniques and computations to study almost L-space knots, ${\it i.e.}$, the knots $K\subset S^3$ with $\dim I^\sharp(S_n^3(K))=n+2$ for some $n\in\mathbb{N}_+$. We show that an almost L-space knot of genus at least $2$ is fibered and strongly quasi-positive, and a genus-one almost L-space knot must be either the figure eight or the mirror of the $5_2$ knot in Rolfsen's knot table.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of meander-like diagrams of knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that each knot has a semimeander diagram (i. e. a diagram composed of two smooth simple arcs), however the number of crossings in such a diagram can only be roughly estimated. In the present paper we provide a new estimate of the complexity of the semimeander diagrams. We prove that for each knot $K$ with more than 10 crossings, there exists a semimeander diagram with no more than $0.31 \cdot 1.558^{\operatorname{cr}(K)}$ crossings, where $\operatorname{cr}(K)$ is the crossing number of $K$. As a corollary, we provide new estimates of the complexity of other meander-like types of knot diagrams, such as meander diagrams and potholders. We also describe an efficient algorithm for constructing a semimeander diagram from a given one.</description>

Abstract: We prove vanishing results for Witten genera of string generalized complete intersections in homogeneous $\text{Spin}^c$-manifolds and in other $\text{Spin}^c$-manifolds with Lie group actions. By applying these results to Fano manifolds with second Betti number equal to one we get new evidence for a conjecture of Stolz.</description>

      <title>Approaches to critical point theory via sequential and parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space was introduced to obtain a lower bound on the number of critical points of a $C^1$-function on a given manifold. Related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and motivated by topological robotics, the topological complexity (TC) of a space is a numerical homotopy invariant whose topological properties are an active field of research. The notions of sequential and parametrized topological complexity extend the ideas of topological complexity. While the definition of TC is closely related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the connections of sequential and parametrized TC to critical point theory have not been fully explored yet. In this article we apply methods from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory to establish various lower bounds on numbers of critical points of functions in terms of sequential and parametrized TCs. We carry out several consequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the parametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.</description>

      <title>Graph quandles: Generalized Cayley graphs of racks and right quasigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian subgraphs on right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes of finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. We prove that there is always at least one Eulerian cycle of this type and introduce a transformation of a cycle along conjugated vertices allowing to build new cycles from a given one. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. It corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle on this polytope via the A.D. Mednykh's construction. We show that any Hamiltonian cycle on a compact right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope arises in this way, while in the finite volume case the necessary and sufficient condition is that at each ideal vertex it does not go straight. The link corresponding to a Hamiltonian cycle on a simple $3$-polytope always contains the Hopf link consisting of two circles. We consider links corresponding to Hamiltonian theta-graphs and Hamiltonian $K_4$-graphs on simple $3$-polytopes introduced by A.D. Mednykh and A.Yu. Vesnin. We give a criterion when such a link consists of mutually unlinked circles and when it is trivial. We give a necessary condition for such a link to be hyperbolic. The simplest example is the Borromean rings corresponding to the Hamiltonian theta-graph on the cube. We introduce the notions of a nonselfcrossing Eulerian theta-graph and $K_4$-graph on a right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope of finite volume with $2$ or $4$ finite vertices and construct the corresponding hyperbolic link.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Dehn function of every finitely presented Bestvina-Brady group grows as a linear, quadratic, cubic, or quartic polynomial. In fact, we provide explicit criteria on the defining graph to determine the degree of this polynomial. As a consequence, we identify an obstruction that prevents certain Bestvina-Brady groups from admitting a CAT(0) structure.</description>

      <title>Compressed data structures for Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heegaard splittings provide a natural representation of closed 3-manifolds by gluing two handlebodies along a common surface. These splittings can be equivalently given by two finite sets of meridians lying on the surface, which define a Heegaard diagram. We present a data structure to effectively represent Heegaard diagrams as normal curves with respect to triangulations of a surface, where the complexity is measured by the space required to express the normal coordinates' vectors in binary. This structure can be significantly more compact than triangulations of 3-manifolds, yielding exponential gains for certain families. Even with this succinct definition of complexity, we establish polynomial-time algorithms for comparing and manipulating diagrams, performing stabilizations, detecting trivial stabilizations and reductions, and computing topological invariants of the underlying manifolds, such as their fundamental and homology groups. We also contrast early implementations of our techniques with standard software programs for 3-manifolds, achieving faster algorithms for the average cases and exponential gains in speed for some particular presentations of the inputs.</description>
