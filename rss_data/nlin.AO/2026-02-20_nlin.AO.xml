      <title>Graphs are maximally expressive for higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that graph-based models are fully capable of representing higher-order interactions, and have a long history of being used for precisely this purpose. This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on "higher-order networks" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to "pairwise" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems.</description>

      <title>A Phase Description of Mutually Coupled Chaotic Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synchronization of rhythms is ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems, and the demand for data-driven analysis is growing. When rhythms arise from limit cycles, phase reduction theory shows that their dynamics are universally modeled as coupled phase oscillators under weak coupling. This simple representation enables direct inference of inter-rhythm coupling functions from measured time-series data. However, strongly rhythmic chaos can masquerade as noisy limit cycles. In such cases, standard estimators still return plausible coupling functions even though a phase-oscillator model lacks a priori justification. We therefore extend the phase description to the chaotic oscillators. Specifically, we derive a closed equation for the phase difference by defining the phase on a Poincar\'e section and averaging the phase dynamics over invariant measures of the induced return maps. Numerically, the derived theoretical functions are in close agreement with those inferred from time-series data. Consequently, our results justify the applicability of phase description to coupled chaotic oscillators and show that data-driven coupling functions retain clear dynamical meaning in the absence of limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium maximum entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.</description>
