      <title>gsaot: an R package for Optimal Transport-based sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: gsaot is an R package for Optimal Transport-based global sensitivity analysis. It provides a simple interface for indices estimation using a variety of state-of-the-art Optimal Transport solvers such as the network simplex and Sinkhorn-Knopp. The package is model-agnostic, allowing analysts to perform the sensitivity analysis as a post-processing step. Moreover, gsaot provides functions for indices and statistics visualization. In this work, we provide an overview of the theoretical grounds, of the implemented algorithms, and show how to use the package in different examples.</description>

      <title>Sliding Window Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that demonstrates this capability.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Variable Selection in Multivariate Regression Under Collinearity in the Design Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of variable selection in Bayesian multivariate linear regression models, involving multiple response and predictor variables, under multivariate normal errors. In the absence of a known covariance structure, specifying a model with a non-diagonal covariance matrix is appealing. Modeling dependency in the random errors through a non-diagonal covariance matrix is generally expected to lead to improved estimation of the regression coefficients. In this article, we highlight an interesting exception: modeling the dependency in errors can significantly worsen both estimation and prediction. We demonstrate that Bayesian multi-outcome regression models using several popular variable selection priors can suffer from poor estimation properties in low-information settings--such as scenarios with weak signals, high correlation among predictors and responses, and small sample sizes. In such cases, the simultaneous estimation of all unknown parameters in the model becomes difficult when using a non-diagonal covariance matrix. Through simulation studies and a dataset with measurements from NIR spectroscopy, we illustrate that a two-step procedure--estimating the mean and the covariance matrix separately--can provide more accurate estimates in such cases. Thus, a potential solution to avoid the problem altogether is to routinely perform an additional analysis with a diagonal covariance matrix, even if the errors are expected to be correlated.</description>

      <title>Large-scale entity resolution via microclustering Ewens--Pitman random partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the microclustering Ewens--Pitman model for random partitions, obtained by scaling the strength parameter of the Ewens--Pitman model linearly with the sample size. The resulting random partition is shown to have the microclustering property, namely: the size of the largest cluster grows sub-linearly with the sample size, while the number of clusters grows linearly. By leveraging the interplay between the Ewens--Pitman random partition with the Pitman--Yor process, we develop efficient variational inference schemes for posterior computation in entity resolution. Our approach achieves a speed-up of three orders of magnitude over existing Bayesian methods for entity resolution, while maintaining competitive empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate of Efficient MCMC with Ancillarity-Sufficiency Interweaving Strategy for Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm efficiency is essential for enhancing computational speed and inferential accuracy in Bayesian analysis. These improvements can be effectively achieved using the ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy (ASIS), an effective means of achieving such gains. Herein, we provide the first rigorous theoretical justification for applying ASIS in Bayesian hierarchical panel data models. Asymptotic analysis demonstrated that when the product of prior variance of unobserved heterogeneity and cross-sectional sample size N is sufficiently large, the latent individual effects can be sampled almost independently of their global mean. This near-independence accounts for ASIS's rapid mixing behavior and highlights its suitability for modern "tall" panel datasets. We derived simple inequalities to predict which conventional data augmentation scheme-sufficient augmentation (SA) or ancillary augmentation (AA)-yields faster convergence. By interweaving SA and AA, ASIS achieves optimal geometric rate of convergence and renders the Markov chain for the global mean parameter asymptotically independent and identically distributed. Monte Carlo experiment confirm that this theoretical efficiency ordering holds even for small panels (e.g., N=10). These findings confirm the empirical success of ASIS application across finance, marketing, and sports, laying the groundwork for its extension to models with more complex covariate structures and nonGaussian specifications.</description>

      <title>Tuning Sequential Monte Carlo Samplers via Greedy Incremental Divergence Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers heavily depends on the tuning of the Markov kernels used in the path proposal. For SMC samplers with unadjusted Markov kernels, standard tuning objectives, such as the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rate or the expected-squared jump distance, are no longer applicable. While stochastic gradient-based end-to-end optimization has been explored for tuning SMC samplers, they often incur excessive training costs, even for tuning just the kernel step sizes. In this work, we propose a general adaptation framework for tuning the Markov kernels in SMC samplers by minimizing the incremental Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the proposal and target paths. For step size tuning, we provide a gradient- and tuning-free algorithm that is generally applicable for kernels such as Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). We further demonstrate the utility of our approach by providing a tailored scheme for tuning kinetic LMC used in SMC samplers. Our implementations are able to obtain a full schedule of tuned parameters at the cost of a few vanilla SMC runs, which is a fraction of gradient-based approaches.</description>
