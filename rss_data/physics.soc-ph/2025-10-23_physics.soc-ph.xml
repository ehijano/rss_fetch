      <title>Prejudice driven spite: A discontinuous phase transition in ultimatum game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a mix of prejudiced and unprejudiced individuals engaged in strategic interactions, the individual intensity of prejudice is expected to have effect on overall level of societal prejudice. High level of prejudice should lead to discrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In this paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum game which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of players, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of spiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition -- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold value of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes progressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where deterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics, approximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is also found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the mutation-selection dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Mapping Resilience and Inequality: A Spatial Analysis of Refugee Communities in Seattle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seattle has long been a center for refugee resettlement in the United States, creating multicultural neighborhoods with complex social and spatial dynamics. This study analyzes the refugee experience in Seattle by examining patterns of housing cost burden, language isolation, religious infrastructure, and crime incidence. These spatial findings are combined with insights from literature on refugee integration, social vulnerability, and community safety. Results show that White Center and Rainier Valley experience severe housing cost burdens and high social vulnerability, indicating significant financial stress and exposure to economic risks. Language isolation is pronounced, as many residents lack English fluency, limiting access to jobs and essential services. Access to religious and cultural institutions is also uneven, affecting community cohesion and cultural preservation. While citywide crime maps show scattered incidents, evidence indicates that refugees are more often victims than offenders, and that their communities do not increase local crime rates. The paper concludes by recommending policies that strengthen affordable housing, expand language assistance, support community and cultural spaces, and promote inclusive public safety programs. These findings aim to inform policymakers, educators, and community organizations about the spatial and social dimensions of refugee life in Seattle.</description>

      <title>Sync or Sink: Bounds on Algorithmic Collective Action with Noise and Multiple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective action against algorithmic systems, which enables groups to promote their own interests, is poised to grow. Hence, there will be growth in the size and the number of distinct collectives. Currently, there is no formal analysis of how coordination challenges within a collective can impact downstream outcomes, or how multiple collectives may affect each other's success. In this work, we aim to provide guarantees on the success of collective action in the presence of both coordination noise and multiple groups. Our insight is that data generated by either multiple collectives or by coordination noise can be viewed as originating from multiple data distributions. Using this framing, we derive bounds on the success of collective action. We conduct experiments to study the effects of noise on collective action. We find that sufficiently high levels of noise can reduce the success of collective action. In certain scenarios, large noise can sink a collective success rate from $100\%$ to just under $60\%$. We identify potential trade-offs between collective size and coordination noise; for example, a collective that is twice as big but with four times more noise experiencing worse outcomes than the smaller, more coordinated one. This work highlights the importance of understanding nuanced dynamics of strategic behavior in algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>A Class of Markovian Self-Reinforcing Processes with Power-Law Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares, email exchanges, and many natural or social systems exhibit bursty dynamics, with periods of intense activity separated by long inactivity. These patterns often follow power- law distributions in inter-event intervals or event rates. Existing models typically capture only one of these features and rely on non-local memory, which complicates analysis and mechanistic interpretation. We introduce a novel self-reinforcing point process whose event rates are governed by local, Markovian nonlinear dynamics and post-event resets. The model generates power-law tails for both inter-event intervals and event rates over a broad range of exponents observed empirically across natural and human phenomena. Compared to non-local models such as Hawkes processes, our approach is mechanistically simpler, highly analytically tractable, and also easier to simulate. We provide methods for model fitting and validation, establishing this framework as a versatile foundation for the study of bursty phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Transient Dynamics in Heterogeneous Networks under Various Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how transient dynamics unfold in response to localized inputs is central to predicting and controlling signal propagation in network systems, including neural processing, epidemic intervention, and power-grid resilience. Existing theoretical frameworks typically assume homogeneous network structures and constant or pulse-like inputs, overlooking how heterogeneity in structure and variety of input shape transient responses, often leading to discrepancies between theory and observation. Here, we develop a general theoretical framework that establishes quantitative relationships between the strength and timing of transient dynamics to various inputs in heterogeneous networks. Using a Neumann series expansion, we disentangle the distinct roles of self-dynamics and network structures beyond the scope of standard spectral theory, yielding intuitive and interpretable formulations. We show that node-to-node propagation can be represented as the cumulative effect of all directed walks, each weighted recursively by the self-dynamics of participating nodes. This framework further quantifies how heterogeneity, such as broad degree distributions or additional motifs, amplifies both response strength and time. Our results advance the understanding of transient dynamics across network structures and input types, extend the existing theory to more general settings, and provide practical guidance for optimizing transient responses.</description>

      <title>When Your AI Agent Succumbs to Peer-Pressure: Studying Opinion-Change Dynamics of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how peer pressure influences the opinions of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across a spectrum of cognitive commitments by embedding them in social networks where they update opinions based on peer perspectives. Our findings reveal key departures from traditional conformity assumptions. First, agents follow a sigmoid curve: stable at low pressure, shifting sharply at threshold, and saturating at high. Second, conformity thresholds vary by model: Gemini 1.5 Flash requires over 70% peer disagreement to flip, whereas ChatGPT-4o-mini shifts with a dissenting minority. Third, we uncover a fundamental "persuasion asymmetry," where shifting an opinion from affirmative-to-negative requires a different cognitive effort than the reverse. This asymmetry results in a "dual cognitive hierarchy": the stability of cognitive constructs inverts based on the direction of persuasion. For instance, affirmatively-held core values are robust against opposition but easily adopted from a negative stance, a pattern that inverts for other constructs like attitudes. These dynamics echoing complex human biases like negativity bias, prove robust across different topics and discursive frames (moral, economic, sociotropic). This research introduces a novel framework for auditing the emergent socio-cognitive behaviors of multi-agent AI systems, demonstrating their decision-making is governed by a fluid, context-dependent architecture, not a static logic.</description>

      <title>Time delay embeddings to characterize the timbre of musical instruments using Topological Data Analysis: a study on synthetic and real data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timbre allows us to distinguish between sounds even when they share the same pitch and loudness, playing an important role in music, instrument recognition, and speech. Traditional approaches, such as frequency analysis or machine learning, often overlook subtle characteristics of sound. Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can capture complex patterns, but its application to timbre has been limited, partly because it is unclear how to represent sound effectively for TDA. In this study, we investigate how different time delay embeddings affect TDA results. Using both synthetic and real audio signals, we identify time delays that enhance the detection of harmonic structures. Our findings show that specific delays, related to fractions of the fundamental period, allow TDA to reveal key harmonic features and distinguish between integer and non-integer harmonics. The method is effective for synthetic and real musical instrument sounds and opens the way for future works, which could extend it to more complex sounds using higher-dimensional embeddings and additional persistence statistics.</description>

      <title>Political Stress Index of Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the political stress index as introduced by Goldstone (1991) and implemented by Turchin (2013), to the case study of Poland. The approach quantifies political and social unrest as a single quantity based on a multitude of economic and demographic variables. The present-day data allow us to directly apply index without the need of simulating the elite component, as was done previously. Neither model version shows appreciable unrest levels for the present, while the simulated model applied to partial historical data yields the index in remarkable agreement with the fall of communism in Poland. We next analyze the model's sensitive dependence on its parameters (the hallmark of chaos), which limits its utility and application to other countries. The original equations cannot, by construction, describe the elite fraction for longer time-periods; and we propose a modification to remedy this problem. The model still holds some predictive power, but we argue that some components should be reinterpreted if one wants to keep its dynamical equations.</description>

      <title>Learning when to rank: Estimation of partial rankings from sparse, noisy comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ranking items based on pairwise comparisons is common, from using match outcomes to rank sports teams to using purchase or survey data to rank consumer products. Statistical inference-based methods such as the Bradley-Terry model, which extract rankings based on an underlying generative model, have emerged as flexible and powerful tools to tackle ranking in empirical data. In situations with limited and/or noisy comparisons, it is often challenging to confidently distinguish the performance of different items based on the evidence available in the data. However, most inference-based ranking methods choose to assign each item to a unique rank or score, suggesting a meaningful distinction when there is none. Here, we develop a principled nonparametric Bayesian method, adaptable to any statistical ranking method, for learning partial rankings (rankings with ties) that distinguishes among the ranks of different items only when there is sufficient evidence available in the data. We develop a fast agglomerative algorithm to perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference of partial rankings under our framework and examine the performance of our method on a variety of real and synthetic network datasets, finding that it frequently gives a more parsimonious summary of the data than traditional ranking, particularly when observations are sparse.</description>

      <title>How to measure the uncertainty of a tournament draw: The case of European football's Champions League</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent empirical studies, the group draw of major sports tournaments can imply a high level of uncertainty, and some lucky teams enjoy an unfair advantage over the other teams. We propose a novel technique to quantify this draw uncertainty, which, arguably, has an optimal level of zero. Our simulation-based approach requires generating a high number of random draws to compute the variance of qualifying probabilities for each team. The method is applied to compare draw uncertainty in the former group stage and the current incomplete round-robin league phase of the UEFA Champions League. We also break down the impact of the 2024/25 reform into various components. The new format is found to decrease draw uncertainty; the reduction can mainly be attributed to the inaccurate seeding system used by UEFA. Our results reveal that the primary benefit of an incomplete round-robin tournament compared to the standard group stage lies in the robustness of its draw uncertainty to the seeding of the teams, which is a crucial aspect of fairness.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>
