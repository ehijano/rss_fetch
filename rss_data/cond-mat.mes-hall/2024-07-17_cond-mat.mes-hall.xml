      <title>High-quality poor man's Majorana bound states from cavity embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poor man's Majorana Bound States (MBS) arise in minimal Kitaev chains when the parameters are fine-tuned to a sweet spot. We consider an interacting two-site Kitaev chain coupled to a single-mode cavity and show that the sweet spot condition can be controlled with the cavity frequency and the hopping between sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that photon-mediated effective interactions can be used to screen intrinsic interactions, improving the original quality of the MBS. We describe experimental signatures in the cavity transmission to detect their presence and quality. Our work proposes a new way to tune poor man's MBS in a quantum dot array coupled to a cavity.</description>

      <title>Theory of phonon spectroscopy with the quantum twisting microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of probing phonon modes of van-der-Waals materials using the quantum twisting microscope. While elastic tunneling dominates the tunneling current at small twist angles, the momentum mismatch between the K-points of tip and sample at large twist angles can only be bridged by inelastic scattering. This allows for probing phonon dispersions along certain lines in reciprocal space by measuring the tunneling current as a function of twist angle and bias voltage. We illustrate this modality of the quantum twisting microscope by developing a systematic theory for graphene-graphene junctions. We show that beyond phonon dispersions, the tunneling current also encodes the strength of electron-phonon couplings. Extracting the coupling strengths for individual phonon modes requires careful consideration of various inelastic tunneling processes. These processes are associated with the intralayer and interlayer electron-phonon couplings and appear at different orders in a perturbative calculation of the tunneling current. We find that the dominant process depends on the particular phonon mode under consideration. Our results inform the quest to understand the origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and provide a case study for quantum-twisting-microscope investigations of collective modes.</description>

      <title>Skew-scattering Pockels effect and metallic electro-optics in gapped bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that a range of strong metallic electro-optic (EO) effects can be naturally realized from non-Drude dynamics of free carriers in metals. In particular, in clean metals we identify skew-scattering and a "Snap" (third-order derivative of velocity) dominating the Pockels and Kerr EO behavior of metals in the clean limit. Strikingly, we find that both Pockels and Kerr EO in metals play critical roles in metallic EO phenomena: for instance, metallic Pockels and Kerr EO effectively compete to produce a field-activated birefringence that is non-reciprocal in applied DC fields. Similarly, both contribute to sizeable field-induced modulations to transmission and reflection across a range of frequencies. We find metallic EO effects can be naturally realized in layered 2D materials such as gapped bilayer graphene producing pronounced values of EO coefficients in the terahertz -- an interesting new metallic platform for terahertz electro-optic modulation.</description>

      <title>Acoustic modulation of individual nanowire quantum dots integrated into a hybrid thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are a powerful tool for controlling a wide range of quantum systems, particularly quantum dots (QDs) via their oscillating strain fields. The resulting energy modulation of these single photon sources can be harnessed to achieve spectral overlap between two QDs otherwise emitting at different wavelengths. In this study, we integrate InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dots onto a thin-film lithium niobate platform, a strong piezoelectric material, and embed them within Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$-loaded waveguides. We demonstrate emission wavelength modulation of 0.70 nm at 13 dBm with a single focused interdigital transducer (FIDT) operating at 400 MHz, and achieve twice this modulation by using two FIDTs as an acoustic cavity. Additionally, we bring two QDs with an initial wavelength difference of 0.5 nm into resonance using SAWs. This scalable strain-tuning approach represents a significant step towards producing indistinguishable single photons from remote emitters heterogeneously integrated on a single photonic chip, and paves the way for large scale on-chip quantum information processing using photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum beats of a macroscopic polariton condensate in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe experimentally the harmonic oscillations of a macroscopic many-body wavefunction of the bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined in an elliptical trap. The oscillations are caused by quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the polariton condensate split in energy due to the ellipticity of the trap. The eigen-functions of these states are $p$-shape orbitals tilted with respect to the main and the short axes of the trap. The beats between these states manifest themselves in a macroscopic periodical redistribution of the polariton density in real space. The control of frequency, amplitude and phase of the beats is achieved by sending non-resonant laser pulses to specific spots inside the trap. We visualize the condensate wave-function dynamics on a streak-camera and map them to the Bloch sphere demonstrating the implementation of Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. The decay time of the observed oscillations is on a nanosecond scale. It exceeds the individual exciton-polariton life-time by two orders of magnitude and the coherence-time of the condensate by one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Inverse participation ratio and entanglement of edge states in HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and entanglement properties of edge states of HgTe quantum wells in a finite strip geometry of width $L$ are studied under quantum information concepts such as: 1) inverse participation ratio (IPR), which measures localization, and 2) entropies of the reduced density matrix (RDM) for the spin sector, which measures quantum correlations due to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Qualitative and quantitative information on the edge states energies and wavefunctions is extracted from analytic and numerical Hamiltonian diagonalization approaches. The previously observed exponential decay of the energy gap with $L$ and its modulations is confirmed and nontrivial consequences of the strip width and Rashba terms on the charge conductance are also reviewed. Analysis of the structure of the edge-state wave functions in terms of spin, momentum $k_x$ in the $x$-direction and position $y$, evidences the spin polarization structure of edge states at the boundaries. An IPR analysis reveals that the valence edge states show maximum localization on the boundaries for certain values of the momenta $k_x$ in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$ point. The edge-state wave packets participate of less and less momenta as we approach to the boundaries $y=0,L$ (and also the center $y=L/2$, for some of them) of the strip. A study of the RDM to the spin sector of edge states sheds complementary information on the structure of spin probabilities in $(k_x,y)$ space, giving clear location of extremal values. The purity and entropies of the RDM inform on the regions $(k_x,y)$ where the spin sector is more and less entangled with the rest of the system, due to SOC.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges per second controlled with a relative uncertainty of one part in $10^8$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never been able to demonstrate such an accuracy. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections, hampering simplicity and further improvement. As a result, national metrology institutes still lack an operational quantum current standard. Here, we present a new quantum current generator, combining both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier, free of error correction, which provides quantized currents driven by the Josephson microwave signal. We show that it can realize the ampere definition with the target uncertainty over a range extended from mA down to $\mu$A and improve end-user current measurements, which are up to now a hundred times less accurate. Other prospects include measuring large resistances using the new current standard in conjunction with a quantum voltmeter and, by exploiting its low-noise performances, bridging the gap with the lower currents of other quantum current sources.</description>

      <title>Edge Optical Effect as Probe of Chiral Topological Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optical effect of chiral topological superconductors in two dimensions. The linear optical response from chiral Bogoliubov edge modes in clean superconductors has in-gap resonances, which is originated from the transitions within the edge particle-hole pair bands. Interestingly, the number of resonance peaks is determined by the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Chern number of topological superconductors. Such features in optical absorption offer a way to distinguish topological superconductors with different Chern number. We further demonstrate that linear optical effect could probe different topological phases in quantum anomalous Hall insulator-superconductor junction devices. This finding provides an applicable method to detect chiral Bogoliubov edge states and is distinguishable from collective modes in superconductors and possible trivial explanations.</description>

      <title>MBE-grown virtual substrates for quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C-bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: InAs semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) emitting in the near infrared are promising platforms for on-demand single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces. However, the realization of quantum-photonic nanodevices emitting in the second and third telecom windows with similar performance remains an open challenge. Here, we report an optimized heterostructure design for QDs emitting in the O- and C-bands grown by means of molecular beam epitaxy. The InAs QDs are grown on compositionally graded InGaAs buffers, which act as virtual substrates, and are embedded in mostly relaxed active regions. Reciprocal space maps of the indium profiles and optical absorption spectra are used to optimize In0.22Ga0.78As and In0.30Ga0.70As active regions, accounting for the chosen indium grading profile. This approach results in a tunable QD photoluminescence (PL) emission from 1200 up to 1600 nm. Power and polarization dependent micro-PL measurements performed at 4 K reveal exciton-biexciton complexes from quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C-bands. The presented study establishes a flexible platform that can be an essential component for advanced photonic devices based on InAs/GaAs that serve as building blocks for future quantum networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software project kdotpy provides a Python application for simulating electronic band structures of semiconductor devices with $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory on a lattice. The application implements the widely used Kane model, capable of reliable predictions of transport and optical properties for a large variety of topological and non-topological materials with a zincblende crystal structure. The application automates the tedious steps of simulating band structures. The user inputs the relevant physical parameters on the command line, for example materials and dimensions of the device, magnetic field, and temperature. The program constructs the appropriate matrix Hamiltonian on a discretized lattice of spatial coordinates and diagonalizes it. The physical observables are extracted from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors and saved as output. The program is highly customizable with a large set of configuration options and material parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a stable form of pulsed electroluminescence in a dopant-free direct bandgap semiconductor heterostructure that we coin the tidal effect. Swapping an inducing gate voltage in an ambipolar field effect transistor allows incoming and outgoing carriers of opposite charge to meet and recombine radiatively. We develop a model to explain the carrier dynamics that underpins the frequency response of the pulsed electroluminesence intensity. Higher mobilities enable larger active emission areas than previous reports, as well as stable emission over long timescales.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect -- Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in the Kondo coupling is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models</description>

      <title>Modeling Kinetic Effects of Charged Vacancies on Electromechanical Responses of Ferroelectrics: Rayleighian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding time-dependent effects of charged vacancies on electromechanical responses of materials is at the forefront of research for designing materials exhibiting metal-insulator transition, and memresistive behavior. A Rayleighian approach is used to develop a model for studying the non-linear kinetics of reaction leading to generation of vacancies and electrons by the dissociation of vacancy-electron pairs. Also, diffusion and elastic effects of charged vacancies are considered to model polarization-electric potential and strain-electric potential hysteresis loops. The model captures multi-physics phenomena by introducing couplings among polarization, electric potential, stress, strain, and concentrations of charged (multivalent) vacancies and electrons (treated as classical negatively charged particles), where the concentrations can vary due to association-dissociation reactions. Derivation of coupled time-dependent equations based on the Rayleighian approach is presented. Three limiting cases of the governing equations are considered highlighting effects of 1) non-linear reaction kinetics on the generation of charged vacancies and electrons, 2) the Vegard's law (i.e., the concentration-dependent local strain) on asymmetric strain-electric potential relations, and 3) coupling between a fast component and the slow component of the net polarization on the polarization-electric field relations. The Rayleighian approach discussed in this work should pave the way for developing a multi-scale modeling framework in a thermodynamically consistent manner while capturing multi-physics phenomena in ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Doping-induced Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystals and Topological Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping carriers into a correlated quantum ground state offers a promising route to generate new quantum states. The recent advent of moir\'{e} superlattices provided a versatile platform with great tunability to explore doping physics in systems with strong interplay between strong correlation and nontrivial topology. Here we study the effect of electron doping in the quantum anomalous Hall insulator realized in TMD moir\'{e} superlatice at filling $\nu=1$, which can be described by the canonical Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. By solving the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using an unrestricted real-space Hartree-Fock method, we find that doping generates quantum anomalous Hall crystals (QAHC) and topological domain walls. In the QAHC, the doping induces skyrmion spin textures, which hosts one or two electrons in each skyrmion as in-gap states. The skyrmions crystallize into a lattice, with the lattice parameter being tunable by the density of doped electrons. Remarkably, we find that the QAHC can survive even in the limit of vanishing Kane-Mele topological gap for a significant range of fillings. Furthermore, doping can also induce domain walls separating topologically distinct domains with different electron densities, hosting chiral localized modes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional sliding ferroelectricity in NbI$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectricity was originally proposed to elucidate the out-of-plane polarization generated by a specific stacking arrangement of non-polar van der Waals layers. However, the concept of sliding ferroelectricity can be generalized to more geometries. Here, the NbI$_4$ bulk is theoretical demonstrated as a quasi-one-dimensional sliding ferroelectric material, which exhibits a polarization of $0.11$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$ perpendicular to the Nb's chains. The most possible ferroelectric switching path is found to be via the interchain sliding along the chain direction, while other paths like Peierls-dimerization of Nb pairs may also work. Moreover, its polarization can be augmented for $82\%$ by hydrostatic pressure up to $10$ GPa, beyond which NbI$_4$ becomes a polar metal. In addition, the negative longitudinal piezoelectricity is also predicted.</description>

      <title>Beyond Energy: Teleporting Current, Charge, and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an homage to Quantum Energy Teleportation, we generalize the idea to arbitrary physical observables, not limited to energy, and prove a rigorous upper bound on the activated ("teleported") quantity. The essence of this protocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground state of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a (1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric current and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of long-range correlations across the system after applying control operations only to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge susceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model initially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral dynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally confirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fractional Chern Insulators through Periodic Strain in Monolayer Graphene and Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the realization of interaction-driven insulators in periodically strained monolayer graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). By analyzing the tunable band structure and band geometry via strain, and performing extensive many-body exact diagonalization of a realistic model, we present compelling evidence for realizing various fractional Chern insulators in both strained monolayer graphene and TMDs. Our thorough analysis across different strain parameters, accounting for experimental variability, reveals that a broad spectrum of fractional Chern insulators, including the Laughlin states, Halperin 112, 332 and 111 states, and Chern number |C| = 2 states, can be stabilized in distinct regions of the phase diagram. These findings suggest that periodically strained monolayer graphene and TMDs provide promising platforms for engineering fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Direct Nanopatterning of Complex 3D Surfaces and Self-Aligned Superlattices via Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional lithography methods involving pattern transfer through resist templating face challenges of material compatibility with various process solvents. Other approaches of direct material writing often compromise pattern complexity and overlay accuracy. Here we explore a concept based on the moir\'e interference of molecular beams to directly pattern complex three-dimensional (3D) surfaces made by any evaporable materials, such as metals, oxides and organic semiconductors. Our proposed approach, termed the Molecular-Beam Holographic Lithography (MBHL), relies on precise control over angular projections of material flux passing through nanoapertures superimposed on the substrate, emulating the interference of coherent laser beams in interference lithography. Incorporating with our computational lithography (CL) algorithm, we have demonstrated self-aligned overlay of multiple material patterns to yield binary up to quinary superlattices, with a critical dimension and overlay accuracy on the order of 50 and 2 nanometers, respectively. The process is expected to substantially expand the boundary of materials combination for high-throughput fabrication of complex superstructures of translational symmetry on arbitrary substrates, enabling new nanoimaging, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of fast and slow excitons with an exchange in quasi-two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of analytical calculations and numerical simulations we study the diffusion properties in quasi-two-dimensional structures with two exciton subsystems with an exchange between them. The experimental realisation is possible in systems where fast and slow exciton subsystems appear. For substantially different diffusion coefficients of the species the negative diffusion can be observed, if one measures the transport properties of only a single subsystem, just as was obtained in experimental studies for quasi-two-dimensional semiconductor systems. The initial transition from a fast subsystem to a slow one results in a delayed release of fast excitons in the area close to the original excitation spot. Hence, the signal from the fast excitons alone includes the delayed replenishment from the transition of slow quasi-particles. This is seen as the narrowing of the exciton density profile or decrease of mean-squared displacement which is then interpreted as a negative diffusion. The average diffusion coefficients for the combined population are analytically expressed through the diffusion coefficients of fast and slow excitons. Simple analytical expressions for effective diffusion coefficients obtained in limiting cases are of interest both for theoretical and experimental analysis of not only the exciton transport, but also for a variety of systems, where fast and slow moving subsystems are present.</description>

      <title>Fractional Wannier Orbitals and Tight-Binding Gauge Fields for Kitaev Honeycomb Superlattices with Flat Majorana Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional excitations offer vast potential for both fundamental physics and quantum technologies. However, their dynamics under the influence of gauge fields pose a significant challenge to conventional models. Here, we investigate the evolution of low-energy Majorana dispersions across various crystalline phases of the \pi-flux in the Kitaev spin model on a honeycomb lattice. We develop an effective tight-binding description for these low-energy Majorana fermions, introducing a gauge potential through a superexchange-like interaction that systematically eliminates the high-energy spectrum. We identify conditions under which this superexchange interaction acts as a Z2 gauge field, governing the tight-binding hopping of Majorana Wannier orbitals. Our study reveals an intriguing phase transition between two non-trivial topological phases characterized by gapless flat-band (extensive) degeneracy. To further explore flat band physics, we introduce a mean-field theory describing a gauge-invariant Majorana density-wave order within these bands. The resulting split Chern bands facilitate the partial filling of Chern bands, effectively leading to fractional Chern states. Our work, encompassing both the gauge-mediated tight-binding model and the mean-field theory, opens doors for future exploration of $U(1)$, $SU(N)$ gauge-mediated tight-binding approach to other fractional or entangled Wannier excitations.</description>

      <title>Finite Element-based Nonlinear Dynamic Optimization of Nanomechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamic simulations of mechanical resonators have been facilitated by the advent of computational techniques that generate nonlinear reduced order models (ROMs) using the finite element (FE) method. However, designing devices with specific nonlinear characteristics remains inefficient since it requires manual adjustment of the design parameters and can result in suboptimal designs. Here, we integrate an FE-based nonlinear ROM technique with a derivative-free optimization algorithm to enable the design of nonlinear mechanical resonators. The resulting methodology is used to optimize the support design of high-stress nanomechanical Si3N4 string resonators, in the presence of conflicting objectives such as simultaneous enhancement of Q-factor and nonlinear Duffing constant. To that end, we generate Pareto frontiers that highlight the trade-offs between optimization objectives and validate the results both numerically and experimentally. To further demonstrate the capability of multi-objective optimization for practical design challenges, we simultaneously optimize the design of nanoresonators for three key figure-of-merits in resonant sensing: power consumption, sensitivity and response time. The presented methodology can facilitate and accelerate designing (nano)mechanical resonators with optimized performance for a wide variety of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that several models of interacting XXZ spin chains subject to boundary driving and dissipation possess a subtle kind of time-reversal symmetry, making their steady states exactly solvable. We focus on a model with a coherent boundary drive, showing that it exhibits a unique continuous dissipative phase transition as a function of the boundary drive amplitude. This transition has no analogue in the bulk closed system, or in incoherently driven models. We also show the steady state magnetization exhibits a surprising fractal dependence on interaction strength, something previously associated with less easily measured infinite-temperature transport quantities (the Drude weight). Our exact solution also directly yields driven-dissipative double-chain models that have pure, entangled steady states that are also current carrying.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale ferroelectric programming of van der Waals heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to create superlattices in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures via moir\'e interference heralded a new era in the science and technology of two-dimensional materials. Through precise control of the twist angle, flat bands and strongly correlated phases have been engineered. The precise twisting of vdW layers is in some sense a bottom-up approach--a single parameter can dial in a wide range of periodic structures. Here, we describe a top-down approach to engineering nanoscale potentials in vdW layers using a buried programmable ferroelectric layer. Ultra-low-voltage electron beam lithography (ULV-EBL) is used to program ferroelectric domains in a ferroelectric Al_{1-x}B_{x}N thin film through a graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructure that is transferred on top. We demonstrate ferroelectric field effects by creating a lateral p-n junction, and demonstrate spatial resolution down to 35 nm, limited by the resolution of our scanned probe characterization methods. This innovative, resist-free patterning method is predicted to achieve 10 nm resolution and enable arbitrary programming of vdW layers, opening a pathway to create new phases that are inaccessible by moir\'e techniques. The ability to "paint" different phases of matter on a single vdW "canvas" provides a wealth of new electronic and photonic functionalities.</description>

Abstract: Second-order superlattices form when moir\'e superlattices of similar periodicities interfere with each other, leading to even larger superlattice periodicities. These crystalline structures have been engineered utilizing two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) under specific alignment conditions. Such specific alignment has shown to play a crucial role in facilitating correlation-driven topological phases featuring the quantized anomalous Hall effect. While signatures of second-order superlattices have been identified in magnetotransport experiments, any real-space visualization is lacking to date. In this work, we present \NT{electronic transport measurements and cryogenic nanoscale photovoltage (PV) measurements} that reveal a second-order superlattice in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene closely aligned to hBN. This is evidenced by long-range periodic photovoltage modulations across the entire sample backed by the corresponding electronic transport features. Supported by theoretical calculations, our experimental data show that even minuscule strain and twist-angle variations on the order of 0.01$^\circ$ can lead to a drastic change of the second-order superlattice structure between local one-dimensional, square or triangular types. Our real-space observations therefore serve as a strong `magnifying glass' for strain and twist angle and can shed new light on the mechanisms responsible for the breaking of spatial symmetries in twisted bilayer graphene, and pave an avenue to engineer long-range superlattice structures in 2D materials using strain fields.</description>

Abstract: A study of strongly curved graphene magnetization and magnetic susceptibility is carried out. Through a Dirac model complemented with a tight-binding model analysis, we are able to show that mechanical deformations solve the long-standing problem of graphene's theoretically calculated diamagnetic divergence at low temperatures. This suggests that corrugations and mechanical defects in graphene are the cause of finite experimentally measurable magnetic susceptibility. Furthermore, a mechanical effect is also found due to an electronic contribution, which produces a pseudo-de Haas van Alphen (dHvA) effect. This effect is related to oscillating (electronic) forces that oppose deformations; these forces are divergent in flat graphene, indicating that graphene (without substrate) achieves mechanical equilibrium by corrugations. In addition, paramagnetism is predicted for graphene with negative curvature under strong magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we theoretically predict a distinct class of anomalous Hall effects occurring in metallic collinear antiferromagnets. The effect is quadratic and $d-$wave symmetric in external magnetic field. In addition, the electric current, transverse to the current voltage drop and the magnetic field in the predicted effect are all in the same plane. Studied theoretical model consists of two-dimensional fermions interacting with the N\'{e}el order through momentum dependent exchange interaction having a $d-$wave symmetry. We also find unusual linear magnetoconductivity in this model. \end{abstract}</description>

Abstract: Optimal choice of spin polarization enables electron injection into the helical edge state at a precise position, despite the uncertainty principle, permitting access to specific nonlocal Green's functions. We show, within 1D effective description, that this fact facilitates a direct identification of odd-frequency pairing through parity measurement (under frequency reversal) of the nonlocal differential conductance in a setup comprising the Josephson junction on the helical edge state of a 2D topological insulator with two spin-polarized probes tunnel-coupled to the junction region. A 2D numerical simulation has also been conducted to confirm theoretical predictions as well as to demonstrate the experimental feasibility of the proposal.</description>

Abstract: We propose a route to detect Majorana bound states (MBSs) by coupling a topological superconductor to quantum dots (QDs) in a $pnp$ junction. Here, two MBSs are coherently coupled to electrons on two QDs, which recombine with holes to photons. We focus on the spectroscopy of cross-correlated shot noise and the polarization of the emitted photons. Our detection scheme allows us to probe the necessary condition for the emergence of MBSs, specifically, the existence of nonlocal triplet superconducting correlations and also the fundamental property that two MBSs comprise a single complex fermion. We compare our results to the ones obtained from nontopological quasi-MBSs (qMBSs) and establish a correspondence between the number of peaks in the cross-correlation with the number of MBSs in the system. Here, we can identify a tunneling regime that facilitates differentiation between topological MBSs and trivial qMBSs. Additionally, we test the robustness of the detection scheme by the addition of uncorrelated quasiparticles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic transport properties of two junctions (BGB, GBG) made of borophene (B) and graphene (G) are investigated. Using the transfer matrix method with Chebyshev polynomials, we have studied single and multiple barriers in a superlattice configuration. We showed that a single barrier exhibits remarkable tilted transport properties, with perfect transmission observed for both junctions under normal incidence. We found that robust superlattice transmission is maintained for multiple barriers, particularly in the BGB junction. It turns out that by varying the incident energy, many gaps appear in the transmission probability. The number, width, and position of these transmission gaps can be manipulated by adjusting the number of cells, incident angle, and barrier characteristics. For diffuse transport, we observed considerable variations in transmission probability, conductance and the Fano factor, highlighting the sensitivity of these junctions to the physical parameters. We showed different behaviors between BGB and GBG junctions, particularly with respect to the response of conductance and Fano factor when barrier height varies. For ballistic transport, we have seen that the minimum {scaled conductance} is related to the maximum Fano factor, demonstrating their control under specific conditions of the physical parameters. Analysis of the length ratio (geometric factor) revealed some remarkable patterns, where {scaled conductance} and the Fano factor converged to certain values as the ratio approached infinity.</description>

Abstract: We present the first detailed study of the effect of a strong magnetic field on single-electron pumping in a device utilising a finger-gate split-gate configuration. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate electron pumping from Landau levels in the leads, where the measurements exhibit pronounced oscillations in the lengths of the pumping plateaus with the magnetic field, reminiscent of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. This similarity indicates that the pumping process is dependent on the density of states of the 2D electron gas over a narrow energy window. Based on these observations, we develop a new theoretical description of the operation of single-electron pumps which for the first time allows for the determination of the physical parameters of the experiment; such as the capture energy of the electrons, the broadening of the quantised Landau levels in the leads, and the quantum lifetime of the electrons.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Control of Excitons in Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a promising platform for novel applications ranging from optoelectronic devices to quantum optics and solid state quantum simulators. While much progress has been made towards characterizing and controlling excitons in TMDs, manipulating their properties during the course of their lifetime - a key requirement for many optoelectronic device and information processing modalities - remains an outstanding challenge. Here we combine long-lived interlayer excitons in angle-aligned MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with fast electrical control to realize dynamical control schemes, in which exciton properties are not predetermined at the time of excitation but can be dynamically manipulated during their lifetime. Leveraging the out-of-plane exciton dipole moment, we use electric fields to demonstrate dynamical control over the exciton emission wavelength. Moreover, employing a patterned gate geometry, we demonstrate rapid local sample doping and toggling of the radiative decay rate through exciton-charge interactions during the exciton lifetime. Spatially mapping the exciton response reveals charge redistribution, offering a novel probe of electronic transport in twisted TMD heterostructures. Our results establish the feasibility of dynamical exciton control schemes, unlocking new directions for exciton-based information processing and optoelectronic devices, and the realization of excitonic phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Coulomb Blockade as a Signature of the Sign-Reversing Cooper Pairing Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coulomb blockade occurs for electrons tunneling into nanoislands because of the quantization of charge. Here, using spectroscopy measurements of nonmagnetic islands grown on a high-Tc superconductor [one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe], we systematically investigate the dynamical Coulomb blockade (DCB), which is found to reflect the Cooper pairing potential in the superconducting substrate. The tunneling spectra are acquired on single-crystalline Pb nanoislands and show a clear suppression of the tunnel current around zero bias-voltage with a gap-like structure. The observed spectral gaps can be attributed to DCB based on our comprehensive investigations, including experiments with finely varying island sizes and calculations of the spectra using the P(E) theory of DCB. Our detailed analysis suggests that the observed DCB can be related to the sign-reversing pairing potential in the 1-UC FeSe substrate below the islands. The sign reversal is furthermore revealed in a transition of the superconducting gap of FeSe from a U- to a V-like lineshape as the distance between neighboring doublet islands is decreased, indicating the presence of a nodal-like gap as expected for a sign-reversing superconductor. Our configuration of nonmagnetic nanoislands on a high-Tc superconductor for spectroscopy measurements may serve as a local, spatially sensitive, and tunable probe for detecting the sign-reversing order parameter in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shot Noise in a Dirty Marginal Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study shot noise in a two-dimensional, disordered marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) driven out of equilibrium. We consider electrons with Planckian dissipation on the Fermi surface coupled to quantum-critical bosons in the presence of disorder. In the non-interacting and strong electron-boson drag limits, MFL effects disappear and our theory reproduces known results. For the case where the bosons remain in equilibrium, inelastic scattering strongly suppresses the noise by dissipating the injected energy. Interestingly, we find that MFL effects do play a role in this regime, and give a weak enhancement on top of the otherwise strong suppression. Our results suggest that shot noise can be strongly suppressed in quantum-critical systems, and this scenario may be relevant to recent measurements in a heavy-fermion strange metal.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effect in a one-dimensional open many-body quantum system with generalized boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), namely that eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonains are localized at one boundary in the open boundary condition, attracts great interest recently.In this paper, we investigate the skin effect in one-dimensional dissipative quantum many-body systems, which we call the Liouvillian skin effect (LSE). We rigorously identify the existence of LSE for generalized boundary conditions by solving the Liouvillian superoperator of an exactly solvable model with the advantage of Bethe ansatz. The LSE is sensitive to boundary conditions where the signature is reflected in eigenfunctions of the system. We confirm that the LSE is fragile to a tiny co-flow boundary hopping with non-Hermitian current but can survive for a counter-flow boundary hopping in the thermodynamic limit. Our work provides a prototypical example of exactly solvable dissipative quantum many-body lattice systems exhibiting LSE for generalized boundary conditions. It can be further extended to other integrable open quantum many-body models.</description>

      <title>Topological effect on the Anderson transition in chiral symmetry classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of an emergent quasi-localized phase in chiral symmetry classes, where wave function along a spatial direction with weak topology is delocalized but exponentially localized along the other directions. The Anderson transition in 2D chiral symmetry classes is induced by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs of a U(1) phase degree of freedom, while the weak topology endows the pair with the Berry phase. We argue that the Berry phase induces spatial polarizations of the pairs along the topological direction through the quantum interference effect, and the proliferation of the polarized vortex pairs results in the quasi-localized phase.</description>

      <title>Tunable band topology and optical conductivity in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic metals taking into account the presence of substrate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We consider the altermagnet bandstructure using a 2D band Hamiltonian near the $\Gamma$ point under external magnetic field. It is shown that time-reversal-symmetry breaking due to altermagnetism, together with Rashba coupling and external magnetic field, can result in non-trivial band topology. The topological phases can be tuned by magnetic field strength and directions, and are classified by their Chern numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the charge response by computing the full optical conductivity tensor with and without magnetic field. In particular, we focus on magneto-optical responses, which are the finite-frequency analog of the Berry curvature-induced anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, using experimentally realistic parameters for RuO$_2$, we estimate the Faraday angle in the absence of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless to BCS-like superconducting transition crossover driven by weak magnetic fields in ultra-thin NbN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in ultra-thin NbN films is investigated in the presence of weak perpendicular magnetic fields. A jump in the phase stiffness at the BKT transition is detected up to 5 G, while the BKT features are smeared between 5 G and 50 G, disappearing altogether at 100 G, where conventional current-voltage behaviour is observed. Our findings demonstrate that weak magnetic fields, insignificant in bulk systems, deeply affect our ultra-thin system, promoting a crossover from Halperin-Nelson fluctuations to a BCS-like state with Ginzburg-Landau fluctuations, as the field increases. This behavior is related to field-induced free vortices that screen the vortex-antivortex interaction and smear the BKT transition.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in organic semiconductors from the mapping approach to surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how to simulate charge diffusion in organic semiconductors using a recently introduced mixed quantum-classical method, the mapping approach to surface hopping. In contrast to standard fewest-switches surface hopping, this method propagates the classical degrees of freedom deterministically on the most populated adiabatic electronic state. This correctly preserves the equilibrium distribution of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons, allowing one to time-average along trajectories to improve the statistical convergence of the calculation. We illustrate the method with an application to a standard model for the charge transport in the direction of maximum mobility in crystalline rubrene. Because of its consistency with the quantum-classical equilibrium distribution, the present method gives a time-dependent diffusion coefficient that plateaus correctly to a long-time limiting value. We end by comparing our results for the mobility and optical conductivity to those of the widely used relaxation time approximation, which uses a phenomenological relaxation parameter to obtain a non-zero diffusion coefficient from a calculation with static phonon disorder. We find that this approximation generally underestimates the charge mobility when compared with our method, which is parameter free and directly simulates the thermal equilibrium diffusion of a quantum charge coupled to classical phonons.</description>
