      <title>Assessing Redundancy Strategies to Improve Availability in Virtualized System Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based storage platforms are becoming more common in both academic and business settings due to their flexible access to data and support for collaborative functionalities. As reliability becomes a vital requirement, particularly for organizations looking for alternatives to public cloud services, assessing the dependability of these systems is crucial. This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the availability of a file server (Nextcloud) hosted in a private cloud environment using Apache CloudStack. The analysis is based on a modeling approach through Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) that allows the evaluation of different redundancy strategies to enhance the availability of such systems. Four architectural configurations were modeled, including the baseline, host-level redundancy, virtual machine (VM) redundancy, and a combination of both. The results show that redundancy at both the host and VM levels significantly improves availability and reduces expected downtime. The proposed approach provides a method to evaluate the availability of a private cloud and support infrastructure design decisions.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Sparse Convolutions in Voxel-Based Point Cloud Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Convolution (SpC) powers 3D point cloud networks widely used in autonomous driving and AR/VR. SpC builds a kernel map that stores mappings between input voxel coordinates, output coordinates, and weight offsets, then uses this map to compute feature vectors for output coordinates. Our work identifies three key properties of voxel coordinates: they are integer-valued, bounded within a limited spatial range, and geometrically continuous-neighboring voxels on the same object surface are highly likely to exist at small spatial offsets from each other. Prior SpC engines do not fully exploit these properties and suffer from high pre-processing and post-processing overheads during kernel map construction. To address this, we design Spira, the first voxel-property-aware SpC engine for GPUs. Spira proposes: (i) a high-performance one-shot search algorithm that builds the kernel map with no preprocessing and high memory locality, (ii) an effective packed-native processing scheme that accesses packed voxel coordinates at low cost, (iii) a flexible dual-dataflow execution mechanism that efficiently computes output feature vectors by adapting to layer characteristics, and (iv) a network-wide parallelization strategy that builds kernel maps for all SpC layers concurrently at network start. Our evaluation shows that Spira significantly outperforms prior SpC engines by 1.71x on average and up to 2.31x for end-to-end inference, and by 2.13x on average and up to 3.32x for layer-wise execution across diverse layer configurations.</description>

      <title>Aragog: Just-in-Time Model Routing for Scalable Serving of Agentic Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic workflows have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multi-stage tasks, but serving them at scale is computationally expensive given the many LLM inferences that each request must pass through. Configuration selection, or the cost-aware assignment of workflow agents to specific LLMs, can reduce these costs, but existing approaches bind configuration decisions before request execution, making them ill-suited for the heterogeneous and lengthy execution of workflows. Specifically, system loads can fluctuate rapidly and substantially during a request's lifetime, causing fixed configurations to quickly become suboptimal. We present Aragog, a system that progressively adapts a request's configuration throughout its execution to match runtime dynamics. To make this practical despite the massive space of workflow configurations, Aragog decouples the problem into two core elements -- a one-time routing step that identifies all accuracy-preserving configurations, and a cheap per-stage scheduler that selects among them using up-to-date system observations -- and introduces novel strategies to accelerate each. Across diverse workflows and model families, Aragog increases maximum serving throughput by 50.0--217.0\% and reduces median latency by 32.5--78.9\% at peak request rates, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the most expensive configurations.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic PD-Disaggregation Architecture for Maximizing Goodput in LLM Inference Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet strict Service-Level Objectives (SLOs),contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) decouple the prefill and decoding stages and place them on separate GPUs to mitigate the distinct bottlenecks inherent to each phase. However, the heterogeneity of LLM workloads causes producerconsumer imbalance between the two instance types in such disaggregated architecture. To address this problem, we propose DOPD (Dynamic Optimal Prefill/Decoding), a dynamic LLM inference system that adjusts instance allocations to achieve an optimal prefill-to-decoding (P/D) ratio based on real-time load monitoring. Combined with an appropriate request-scheduling policy, DOPD effectively resolves imbalances between prefill and decoding instances and mitigates resource allocation mismatches due to mixed-length requests under high concurrency. Experimental evaluations show that, compared with vLLM and DistServe (representative aggregation-based and disaggregationbased approaches), DOPD improves overall system goodput by up to 1.5X, decreases P90 time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 67.5%, and decreases P90 time-per-output-token (TPOT) by up to 22.8%. Furthermore, our dynamic P/D adjustment technique performs proactive reconfiguration based on historical load, achieving over 99% SLOs attainment while using less additional resources.</description>

      <title>Handling of Memory Page Faults during Virtual-Address RDMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, avoiding system calls during cluster communication (e.g., in Data Centers and High Performance Computing) in modern high-speed interconnection networks has become a necessity, due to the high overhead of multiple data copies between kernel and user space. User-level zero-copy Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technologies address this problem by improving performance and reducing system energy consumption. However, traditional RDMA engines cannot tolerate page faults and therefore use various techniques to avoid them.
  State-of-the-art RDMA approaches typically rely on pinning address spaces or multiple pages per application. This method introduces long-term disadvantages due to increased programming complexity (pinning and unpinning buffers), limits on how much memory can be pinned, and inefficient memory utilization. In addition, pinning does not fully prevent page faults because modern operating systems apply internal optimization mechanisms, such as Transparent Huge Pages (THP), which are enabled by default in Linux.
  This thesis implements a page-fault handling mechanism integrated with the DMA engine of the ExaNeSt project. Faults are detected by the ARM System Memory Management Unit (SMMU) and resolved through a hardware-software solution that can request retransmission when needed. This mechanism required modifications to the Linux SMMU driver, the development of a new software library, changes to the DMA engine hardware, and adjustments to the DMA scheduling logic. Experiments were conducted on the Quad-FPGA Daughter Board (QFDB) of ExaNeSt, which uses Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs.
  Finally, we evaluate our mechanism and compare it against alternatives such as pinning and pre-faulting, and discuss the advantages of our approach.</description>

      <title>Automated Dynamic AI Inference Scaling on HPC-Infrastructure: Integrating Kubernetes, Slurm and vLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to rising demands for Artificial Inteligence (AI) inference, especially in higher education, novel solutions utilising existing infrastructure are emerging. The utilisation of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has become a prevalent approach for the implementation of such solutions. However, the classical operating model of HPC does not adapt well to the requirements of synchronous, user-facing dynamic AI application workloads. In this paper, we propose our solution that serves LLMs by integrating vLLM, Slurm and Kubernetes on the supercomputer \textit{RAMSES}. The initial benchmark indicates that the proposed architecture scales efficiently for 100, 500 and 1000 concurrent requests, incurring only an overhead of approximately 500 ms in terms of end-to-end latency.</description>

      <title>MemFine: Memory-Aware Fine-Grained Scheduling for MoE Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The training of large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models faces a critical memory bottleneck due to severe load imbalance caused by dynamic token routing. This imbalance leads to memory overflow on GPUs with limited capacity, constraining model scalability. Existing load balancing methods, which cap expert capacity, compromise model accuracy and fail on memory-constrained hardware. To address this, we propose MemFine, a memory-aware fine-grained scheduling framework for MoE training. MemFine decomposes the token distribution and expert computation into manageable chunks and employs a chunked recomputation strategy, dynamically optimized through a theoretical memory model to balance memory efficiency and throughput. Experiments demonstrate that MemFine reduces activation memory by 48.03% and improves throughput by 4.42% compared to full recomputation-based baselines, enabling stable large-scale MoE training on memory-limited GPUs.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Data Redundancy on Speedup in MLFMA Near-Field Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-field (P2P) operator in the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is a performance bottleneck on GPUs due to poor memory locality. This work introduces data redundancy to improve spatial locality by reducing memory access dispersion. For validation of results, we propose an analytical model based on a Locality metric that combines data volume and access dispersion to predict speedup trends without hardware-specific profiling. The approach is validated on two MLFMA-based applications: an electromagnetic solver (DBIM-MLFMA) with regular structure, and a stellar dynamics code (PhotoNs-2.0) with irregular particle distribution. Results show up to 7X kernel speedup due to improved cache behavior. However, increased data volume raises overheads in data restructuring, limiting end-to-end application speedup to 1.04X. While the model cannot precisely predict absolute speedups, it reliably captures performance trends across different problem sizes and densities. The technique is injectable into existing implementations with minimal code changes. This work demonstrates that data redundancy can enhance GPU performance for P2P operator, provided locality gains outweigh data movement costs.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Scaling: A Multi-Dimensional Resource Model and Optimization Framework for Distributed Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cloud databases present scaling as a binary decision: scale-out by adding nodes or scale-up by increasing per-node resources. This one-dimensional view is limiting because database performance, cost, and coordination overhead emerge from the joint interaction of horizontal elasticity and per-node CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and storage IOPS. As a result, systems often overreact to load spikes, underreact to memory pressure, or oscillate between suboptimal states. We introduce the Scaling Plane, a two-dimensional model in which each distributed database configuration is represented as a point (H, V), with H denoting node count and V a vector of resources. Over this plane, we define smooth approximations of latency, throughput, coordination overhead, and monetary cost, providing a unified view of performance trade-offs. We show analytically and empirically that optimal scaling trajectories frequently lie along diagonal paths: sequences of joint horizontal and vertical adjustments that simultaneously exploit cluster parallelism and per-node improvements. To compute such actions, we propose DIAGONALSCALE, a discrete local-search algorithm that evaluates horizontal, vertical, and diagonal moves in the Scaling Plane and selects the configuration minimizing a multi-objective function subject to SLA constraints. Using synthetic surfaces, microbenchmarks, and experiments on distributed SQL and KV systems, we demonstrate that diagonal scaling reduces p95 latency by up to 40 percent, lowers cost-per-query by up to 37 percent, and reduces rebalancing by 2 to 5 times compared to horizontal-only and vertical-only autoscaling. Our results highlight the need for multi-dimensional scaling models and provide a foundation for next-generation autoscaling in cloud database systems.</description>

      <title>AI/ML Model Cards in Edge AI Cyberinfrastructure: towards Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI/ML model cards can contain a benchmarked evaluation of an AI/ML model against intended use but a one time assessment during model training does not get at how and where a model is actually used over its lifetime. Through Patra Model Cards embedded in the ICICLE AI Institute software ecosystem we study model cards as dynamic objects. The study reported here assesses the benefits and tradeoffs of adopting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an interface to the Patra Model Card server. Quantitative assessment shows the overhead of MCP as compared to a REST interface. The core question however is of active sessions enabled by MCP; this is a qualitative question of fit and use in the context of dynamic model cards that we address as well.</description>

      <title>Readout-Side Bypass for Residual Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises compact and expressive representations, but suffers from the measurement bottleneck - a narrow quantum-to-classical readout that limits performance and amplifies privacy risk. We propose a lightweight residual hybrid architecture that concatenates quantum features with raw inputs before classification, bypassing the bottleneck without increasing quantum complexity. Experiments show our model outperforms pure quantum and prior hybrid models in both centralized and federated settings. It achieves up to +55% accuracy improvement over quantum baselines, while retaining low communication cost and enhanced privacy robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the residual connection at the quantum-classical interface. Our method offers a practical, near-term pathway for integrating quantum models into privacy-sensitive, resource-constrained settings like federated edge learning.</description>

      <title>Privacy in Federated Learning with Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.</description>

      <title>MAD-DAG: Protecting Blockchain Consensus from MEV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchain security is threatened by selfish mining, where a miner (operator) deviates from the protocol to increase their revenue. Selfish mining is exacerbated by adverse conditions: rushing (network propagation advantage for the selfish miner), varying block rewards due to block contents, called miner extractable value (MEV), and petty-compliant miners who accept bribes from the selfish miner.
  The state-of-the-art selfish-mining-resistant blockchain protocol, Colordag, does not treat these adverse conditions and was proven secure only when its latency is impractically high.
  We present MAD-DAG, Mutually-Assured-Destruction Directed-Acyclic-Graph, the first practical protocol to counter selfish mining under adverse conditions. MAD-DAG achieves this thanks to its novel ledger function, which discards the contents of equal-length chains competing to be the longest.
  We analyze selfish mining in both Colordag and MAD-DAG by modeling a rational miner using a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We obtain a tractable model for both by developing conservative reward rules that favor the selfish miner to yield an upper bound on selfish mining revenue. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tractable model of selfish mining in a practical DAG-based blockchain. This enables us to obtain a lower bound on the security threshold, the minimum fraction of computational power a miner needs in order to profit from selfish mining.
  MAD-DAG withstands adverse conditions under which Colordag and Bitcoin fail, while otherwise maintaining comparable security. For example, with petty-compliant miners and high levels of block reward variability, MAD-DAG's security threshold ranges from 11% to 31%, whereas both Colordag and Bitcoin achieve 0% for all levels.</description>

      <title>DSD: A Distributed Speculative Decoding Solution for Edge-Cloud Agile Large Model Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-target execution. Given the lack of prior work on simulating this paradigm, we first introduce DSD-Sim, a discrete-event simulator that captures network, batching, and scheduling dynamics. Building on insights from DSD-Sim, we further design an Adaptive Window Control (AWC) policy that dynamically adjusts speculation window size to optimize throughput. Experiments across diverse workloads show that DSD achieves up to 1.1x speedup and 9.7% higher throughput over existing SD baselines, enabling agile and scalable LLM serving across edge and cloud.</description>

      <title>IOMMU Support for Virtual-Address Remote DMA in an ARMv8 environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In complex systems with many compute nodes containing multiple CPUs that are coherent within each node, a key challenge is maintaining efficient and correct coherence between nodes. The Unimem system addresses this by proposing a virtualized global address space that enables such coherence, relying on the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) in each node. The goal of this thesis is to support this approach by successfully testing and using the IOMMU of a single node. For this purpose, we used ARM's IOMMU, known as the System Memory Management Unit (SMMU), which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Because Linux documentation for the SMMU is limited and unclear, we implemented custom kernel modules to test and use its functionality.
  First, we tested the SMMU in the Processing System (PS) of the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC by developing a module that inserted virtual-to-physical address mappings into the SMMU. We then triggered a DMA transfer to a virtual address and observed that the request passed through the SMMU for address translation. We repeated this experiment by initiating DMA transactions from the Programmable Logic (PL) and similarly confirmed that the transactions were translated by the SMMU. Finally, we developed a module that enables transactions from the PL without requiring explicit pre-mapping of virtual and physical address pairs. This was achieved by configuring the SMMU with the page table pointer of a user process, allowing it to translate all relevant virtual addresses dynamically.
  Overall, we successfully demonstrated the correct operation of the SMMU across all tested scenarios. Due to time constraints, further exploration of advanced SMMU features is left for future work.</description>

      <title>No Request Left Behind: Tackling Heterogeneity in Long-Context LLM Inference with Medha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17264v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying million-token Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging because production workloads are highly heterogeneous, mixing short queries and long documents. This heterogeneity, combined with the quadratic complexity of attention, creates severe convoy effects where long-running requests stall short, interactive ones, degrading system responsiveness. We present Medha, a serving system that eliminates these convoys by introducing fine-grained, preemptive scheduling to LLM inference.
  Medha makes preemption practical with a co-designed set of mechanisms -- including Adaptive Chunking and Stream Pipeline Parallel that overcome the perceived inefficiencies and scaling challenges of chunking. Additionally, we present a new parallelism strategy KV-Cache Parallelism to reduce the decode latency and afford interactivity despite very long context. These mechanisms are orchestrated by a Length-Aware Relative Slack (LARS) scheduler, a deadline and heterogeneity-aware scheduling policy that prevents both the convoy effect and the starvation that plagues simpler policies. Under a heterogeneous workload, Medha improves throughput by 5.7x while reducing median and 99th percentile latency by 30x and 174x, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art non-preemptive systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing GPU Energy Usage in Exascale-Ready Portable Science Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the GPU energy usage of two widely adopted exascale-ready applications representing two classes of particle and mesh solvers: (i) QMCPACK, a quantum Monte Carlo package, and (ii) AMReXCastro, an adaptive mesh astrophysical code. We analyze power, temperature, utilization, and energy traces from double-/single (mixed)-precision benchmarks on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 and AMD's MI250X GPUs using queries in NVML and rocm_smi_lib, respectively. We explore application-specific metrics to provide insights on energy vs. performance trade-offs. Our results suggest that mixed-precision energy savings range between 6-25% on QMCPACK and 45% on AMReX-Castro. Also, we found gaps in the AMD tooling used on Frontier GPUs that need to be understood, while query resolutions on NVML have little variability between 1 ms-1 s. Overall, application level knowledge is crucial to define energy-cost/science-benefit opportunities for the codesign of future supercomputer architectures in the post-Moore era.</description>
