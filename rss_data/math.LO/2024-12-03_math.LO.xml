      <title>The transcendence degree of the reals over certain set-theoretical subfields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a well-known result that, after adding one Cohen real, the transcendence degree of the reals over the ground-model reals is continuum. We extend this result for a set $X$ of finitely many Cohen reals, by showing that, in the forcing extension, the transcendence degree of the reals over a combination of the reals in the extension given by each proper subset of $X$ is also maximal. This answers a question of Kanovei and Schindler.</description>

      <title>Local tabularity in MS4 with Casari's axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local tabularity (local finiteness) in some extensions of $\mathsf{MS4}$ (monadic $\mathsf{S4}$) that include products of transitive modal logics. Our main results are a syntactic characterization of local finiteness in varieties of $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$-algebras, where $\mathsf{M^{+}S4}$ denotes the extension of $\mathsf{MS4}$ by the Casari axiom, and $(\mathsf{S4}[2] \times \mathsf{S5})$-algebras. For the latter, we demonstrate that our methods cannot be extended beyond depth 2, as we give a translation of the fusion $\mathsf{S5}_2$ into $\mathsf{S4}[n] \times \mathsf{S5}$ for $n \geq 3$ that preserves and reflects local finiteness, suggesting that a characterization there is difficult. We also establish the finite model property for some of these logics which are not known to be locally tabular.</description>

      <title>A Relation on ${(\omega, &lt;)}$ of Intermediate Degree Spectrum on a Cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the degree spectra of relations on ${(\omega, &lt;)}$. Given an additional relation $R$ on ${(\omega,&lt;)}$, such as the successor relation, the degree spectrum of $R$ is the set of Turing degrees of $R$ in computable copies of ${(\omega,&lt;)}$. It is known that all degree spectra of relations on ${(\omega,&lt;)}$ fall into one of four categories: the computable degree, all of the c.e. degrees, all of the $\Delta^0_2$ degrees, or intermediate between the c.e. degrees and the $\Delta^0_2$ degrees. Examples of the first three degree spectra are easy to construct and well-known, but until recently it was open whether there is a relation with intermediate degree spectrum on a cone. Bazhenov, Kaloci\'{n}ski, and Wroclawski constructed an example of an intermediate degree spectrum, but their example is unnatural in the sense that it is constructed by diagonalization and thus not canonical, that is, which relation you obtain from their construction depends on which G\"odel encoding (and hence order of enumeration) of the partial computable functions / programs you choose. In this paper, we use the ''on-a-cone'' paradigm to restrict our attention to "natural" relations $R$. Our main result is a construction of a natural relation on ${(\omega,&lt;)}$ which has intermediate degree spectrum. This relation has intermediate degree spectrum because of structural reasons.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of countable Borel equivalence relations (CBERs) on topological Ramsey spaces. First, we give a simple proof of the fact that every CBER on $[\mathbb{N}]^{\mathbb{N}}$ is hyperfinite on some set of the form $[A]^{\mathbb{N}}$. Using the idea behind the proof, we show the analogous result for every topological Ramsey space.</description>

      <title>Towards Proof-Theoretic Formulation of the General Theory of Term-Forming Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Term-forming operators (tfos), like iota- or epsilon-operator, are technical devices applied to build complex terms in formal languages. Although they are very useful in practice their theory is not well developed. In the paper we provide a proof-theoretic formulation of the general approach to tfos provided independently by several authors like Scott, Hatcher, Corcoran, and compare it with an approach proposed later by Tennant. Eventually it is shown how the general theory can be applied to specific areas like Quine's set theory NF.</description>

      <title>Superhypergraph Neural Networks and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks: Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional graphs by allowing edges to connect multiple nodes, while superhypergraphs further generalize this concept to represent even more complex relationships. Neural networks, inspired by biological systems, are widely used for tasks such as pattern recognition, data classification, and prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a well-established framework, have recently been extended to Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs), with their properties and applications being actively studied. The Plithogenic Graph framework enhances graph representations by integrating multi-valued attributes, as well as membership and contradiction functions, enabling the detailed modeling of complex relationships. In the context of handling uncertainty, concepts such as Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs have gained prominence. It is well established that Plithogenic Graphs serve as a generalization of both Fuzzy Graphs and Neutrosophic Graphs. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Graph Neural Network has been proposed and is an active area of research. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the development of SuperHyperGraph Neural Networks (SHGNNs) and Plithogenic Graph Neural Networks, expanding the applicability of neural networks to these advanced graph structures. While mathematical generalizations and proofs are presented, future computational experiments are anticipated.</description>

      <title>Definite Descriptions and Hybrid Tense Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a version of first-order hybrid tense logic with predicate abstracts and definite descriptions as the only non-rigid terms. It is formalised by means of a tableau calculus working on sat-formulas. A particular theory of DD exploited here is essentially based on the approach of Russell, but with descriptions treated as genuine terms. However, the reductionist aspect of the Russellian approach is retained in several ways. Moreover, a special form of tense definite descriptions is formally developed. A constructive proof of the interpolation theorem for this calculus is given, which is an extension of the result provided by Blackburn and Marx.</description>

      <title>Correspondence and Inverse Correspondence for Input/Output Logic and Region-Based Theories of Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further develop the algebraic approach to input/output logic initiated in \cite{wollic22}, where subordination algebras and a family of their generalizations were proposed as a semantic environment of various input/output logics. In particular: we extend the modal characterizations of a finite number of well known conditions on normative and permission systems, as well as on subordination, precontact, and dual precontact algebras developed in \cite{de2024obligations}, to those corresponding to the infinite class of {\em clopen-analytic inequalities} in a modal language consisting both of positive and of negative unary modal operators; we characterize the syntactic shape of first-order conditions on algebras endowed with subordination, precontact, and dual precontact relations which guarantees these conditions to be the first-order correspondents of axioms in the modal language above; we introduce algorithms for computing the first-order correspondents of modal axioms on algebras endowed with subordination, precontact, and dual precontact relations, and conversely, for computing the modal axioms of which the conditions satisfying the suitable syntactic shape are the first-order correspondents; finally, we extend Celani's dual characterization results between subordination lattices and subordination spaces to a wider environment which also encompasses precontact and dual precontact relations, and relative to an infinite class of first order conditions relating subordination, precontact and dual precontact relations on distributive lattices. The modal characterizations established in the present paper pave the way to establishing faithful embeddings for infinite classes of input/output logics, and hence to their implementation in LogiKEy, Isabelle/HOL, Lean, or other interactive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For all infinite rings $R$ that are finitely generated over $\mathbb{Z}$, we show that Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative answer. This is accomplished by constructing elliptic curves $E$ without rank growth in certain quadratic extensions $L/K$. To achieve such a result unconditionally, our key innovation is to use elliptic curves $E$ with full rational $2$-torsion which allows us to combine techniques from additive combinatorics with $2$-descent.</description>

      <title>Corona Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a unified overview of the study of the effects of additional set theoretic axioms on quotient structures. Our focus is on rigidity, measured in terms of existence (or rather non-existence) of suitably \emph{non-trivial} automorphisms of the quotients in question. A textbook example for the study of this topic is the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/Fin$, whose behavior is the template around which this survey revolves: Forcing axioms imply that all of its automorphisms are \emph{trivial}, in the sense that they are induced by almost permutations of $\mathbb N$, while under the Continuum Hypothesis this rigidity fails and $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/Fin$ admits uncountably many non-trivial automorphisms. We consider far-reaching generalizations of this phenomenon and present a wide variety of situations where analogous patterns persist, focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on the categories of Boolean algebras, \v Cech--Stone remainders, and $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. We survey the state of the art and the future prospects of this field, discussing the major open problems and outlining the main ideas of the proofs whenever possible.</description>

      <title>Lebesgue measure zero modulo ideals on the natural numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a reformulation of the ideal $\mathcal{N}$ of Lebesgue measure zero sets of reals modulo an ideal $J$ on $\omega$, which we denote by $\mathcal{N}_J$. In the same way, we reformulate the ideal $\mathcal{E}$ generated by $F_\sigma$ measure zero sets of reals modulo $J$, which we denote by $\mathcal{N}^*_J$. We show that these are $\sigma$-ideals and that $\mathcal{N}_J=\mathcal{N}$ iff $J$ has the Baire property, which in turn is equivalent to $\mathcal{N}^*_J=\mathcal{E}$. Moreover, we prove that $\mathcal{N}_J$ does not contain co-meager sets and $\mathcal{N}^*_J$ contains non-meager sets when $J$ does not have the Baire property. We also prove a deep connection between these ideals modulo $J$ and the notion of nearly coherence of filters (or ideals).
  We also study the cardinal characteristics associated with $\mathcal{N}_J$ and $\mathcal{N}^*_J$. We show their position with respect to Cicho\'n's diagram and prove consistency results in connection with other very classical cardinal characteristics of the continuum, leaving just very few open questions. To achieve this, we discovered a new characterization of $\mathrm{add}(\mathcal{N})$ and $\mathrm{cof}(\mathcal{N})$. We also show that, in Cohen model, we can obtain many different values to the cardinal characteristics associated with our new ideals.</description>

Abstract: We investigate game-theoretic variants of cardinal invariants of the continuum. The invariants we treat are the reaping number $\mathfrak{r}$, the bounding number $\mathfrak{b}$, the dominating number $\mathfrak{d}$, and the additivity number of the null ideal $\operatorname{add}(\mathsf{null})$. We also consider games, called tallness games, defined according to ideals on $\omega$ and characterize that each of Player I and Player II has a winning strategy.</description>

      <title>Extremal models and direct integrals in affine logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine logic is a fragment of continuous logic, introduced by Bagheri, in which only affine functions are allowed as connectives. This has the effect of endowing type spaces with the structure of compact convex sets. We study extremal models of affine theories (those that only realize extreme types), and the ways and conditions under which all models can be described from the extremal ones.
  We introduce and develop the general theory of measurable fields of metric structures and their direct integrals. One of our main results is an extremal decomposition theorem for models of simplicial theories, that is, affine theories whose type spaces form Choquet simplices. We prove that every model of a simplicial theory can be (uniquely) decomposed as a direct integral of extremal models. This generalizes known decomposition results (ergodic decomposition, tracial von Neumann factor decomposition), and moreover, holds without any separability hypothesis.
  Two extreme kinds of simplicial theories are Bauer theories, whose extreme types form a closed set, and Poulsen theories, whose extreme types form a dense set. We show that Keisler randomizations of continuous theories are, essentially, the same thing as affine Bauer theories. We establish a dichotomy result: a complete simplicial theory is either Bauer or Poulsen.
  As part of our analysis, we adapt many results and tools from continuous logic to the affine or extremal contexts (definability, saturation, type isolation, categoricity, etc.). We also provide a detailed study of the relations between continuous logic and affine logic.
  Finally, we present several examples of simplicial theories arising from theories in discrete logic, Hilbert spaces, probability measure-preserving systems, and tracial von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>On the Model Theory of Open Incidence Structures: The Rank 2 Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking inspiration from [1, 21, 24], we develop a general framework to deal with the model theory of open incidence structures. In this first paper we focus on the study of systems of points and lines (rank $2$). This has a number of applications, in particular we show that for any of the following classes all the non-degenerate free structures are elementarily equivalent, and their common theory is decidable, strictly stable, and with no prime model: $(k, n)$-Steiner systems (for $2 \leq k &lt; n$); generalised $n$-gons (for $n \geq 3$); $k$-nets (for $k \geq 3$); affine planes; projective M\"obius, Laguerre and Minkowski planes.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Kirillov conjecture as a first-order formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a (reduced) root system. Let $\mathsf{k}$ be an algebraically closed field of zero characteristic, and consider the corresponding semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathsf{k}, \Sigma}$. Then there is a first-order sentence $\phi_\Sigma$ in the language $\mathcal{L}=(1,0,+,*,-)$ of rings such that, for any algebraically closed field $\mathsf{k}$ of characteristic 0, the validity of the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathsf{k}, \Sigma}$ is equivalent to $ACF_0 \vdash \phi_\Sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06941v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the minimal number of existential quantifiers needed to define a diophantine set over a field and relate this number to the essential dimension of the functor of points associated to such a definition.</description>

      <title>Graph structure of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanics is proved to admit no hidden-variable in 1960s, which means the quantum systems are contextual. Revealing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is a significant task. We develop the approach of partial Boolean algebra to characterize the contextuality theory with local consistency and exclusivity, and then prove that the finite dimensional quantum systems are determined by atoms using two graph structure theorems. We also generalize our work to infinite dimensional cases. Our conclusions indicate that the quantum mechanics is a graph-structured combination of multiple hidden-variable theories, and provide a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality.</description>
