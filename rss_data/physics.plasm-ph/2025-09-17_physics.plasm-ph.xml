      <title>The effect of parameter drift in the transport of magnetized plasma particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how time dependent modulations of drift wave amplitudes affect particle transport and chaos in a magnetized plasma. Using the Horton model, we apply a sawtooth ramp to a primary wave's amplitude and periodic rectangular kicks to secondary waves, simulating a driven system. Particle transport is quantified by the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) exponent, $\alpha$, and chaos by the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE). Our primary finding is a strong negative correlation between the system's average chaoticity and its transport efficiency. We show that rapid sawtooth ramping (short period $\tau$) produces highly efficient, superdiffusive transport ($\alpha &gt; 1$). In contrast, slower ramping increases the system's chaos but suppresses transport, driving it towards normal diffusion ($\alpha \to 1$). This counter intuitive result demonstrates that heightened chaos destroys the coherent, streamer like structures necessary for superdiffusive flights. Our findings indicate that the coherence of the turbulent field, rather than its raw chaoticity, is the key determinant of transport efficiency, offering a new perspective on plasma control.</description>

      <title>Generating 10 GW-class isolated zeptosecond x-ray bursts through bootstrapping two plasma-based accelerator stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is proposed to generate coherent, intense zeptosecond x-ray pulses by using the electron beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) stage as the driver for a beam driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) stage. The LWFA injector stage requires a readily available 100 TW laser driver to produce a GeV class self-injected electron beam. This beam is focused and used as the driver in a PWFA stage that utilizes a solid-density plasma with a modulated density downramp. The concept is shown to be capable of producing an ultra-short electron beam with unprecedented density ($10^{26}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) and brightness ($ 10^{24}~\ampere/\meter^2/\radian ^2$), that is also pre-bunched on 0.1 Angstrom scales. By colliding this pre-bunched extreme beam with an optical undulator, an intense zeptosecond pulse can be emitted if the spatially focusing region is matched with the lasing region of the beam. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed of the entire concept to demonstrate that an isolated 10 GW-class zeptosecond pulse with a full-width-half-maximum duration of 700 zs can be generated in a tapered laser pulse. Such an intense zeptosecond pulse generation scheme may provide an essential probe for nuclear physics and quantum electrodynamics processes.</description>

      <title>Grid instability growth rates for explicit, electrostatic momentum- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the Debye length is not resolved in a simulation using the most common particle-in-cell (PIC) algorithm, the plasma will unphysically heat until the Debye length becomes resolved via a phenomenon known as grid heating. This article presents detailed numerical measurements of grid heating for several explicit PIC algorithms including the first systematic (covering the Debye length resolution and drift-velocity parameter space) study of grid-heating growth rates for the most-common electrostatic momentum-conserving PIC algorithm. Additionally, we derive and test a cubic-spline-based PIC algorithm that ensures that the interpolated electric field has a continuous first derivative, but find that a differentiable electric field has minimal impact on grid-heating stability. Also considered are energy-conserving PIC algorithms with linear and quadratic interpolation functions. In all cases, we find that unphysical heating can occur for some combinations of Debye under-resolution and plasma drift. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that grid heating cannot be eliminated by using a higher-order field solve, and give an analytical expression for the cold-beam stability limits of some energy-conserving algorithms.</description>

      <title>Testing strong-field QED with the avalanche precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-beam high-power laser facility is essential for the study of one of the most captivating phenomena predicted by strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) and yet unobserved experimentally: the avalanche-type cascade. In such a cascade, the energy of intense laser light can be efficiently transformed into high-energy radiation and electron-positron pairs. The future 50-petawatt-scale laser facility NSF OPAL will provide unique opportunities for studying such strong-field QED effects, as it is designed to deliver two ultra-intense, tightly focused laser pulses onto the interaction point. In this work, we investigate the potential of such a facility for studying elementary particle and plasma dynamics deeply in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, and the generation of QED avalanches. With 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that QED avalanche precursors can be reliably triggered under realistic laser parameters and layout (namely, focusing $f/2$, tilted optical axes, and non-ideal co-pointing) with the anticipated capabilities of NSF OPAL. We demonstrate that seed electrons can be efficiently injected into the laser focus by using targets of three types: a gas of heavy atoms, an overcritical plasma, and a thin foil. A strong positron and high-energy photon signal is generated in all cases. The cascade properties can be identified from the final particle distributions, which have a clear directional pattern. At increasing laser field intensity, such distributions provide signatures of the transition, first, to the radiation-dominated interaction regime, and then to a QED avalanche. Our findings can also be used for designing related future experiments.</description>

      <title>Ionization rate vs. laser intensity determined from ion count vs. peak intensity due to neutral gas exposure to an 800 nm ultrashort pulsed laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical cycle-averaged ionization rate of Ar, O$_{2}$, and N$_{2}$ vs. local instantaneous laser intensity $I$ for linear polarized $800$ nm light is determined up to approx. $300$ TW/cm$^{2}$ by numerically inverting published time-of-flight ion spectrometer data. The published Ar$^{+}$ collection efficiency of the microchannel plate (MCP) at the end of the spectrometer and its $I_{0}$ scale are recalibrated by fitting it to its high $I_{0}$ solution. The relative collection efficiencies of the other species are determined by published MCP cathode data. Results for O$_2$ are consistent with a reevaluation of published data used to determine its cross section $\sigma_8$ in the multiphoton (low $I$) regime.</description>
