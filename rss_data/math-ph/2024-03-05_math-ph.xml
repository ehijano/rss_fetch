      <title>Comments on the paper "Derivation of lump solutions to a variety of Boussinesq equations with distinct dimensions."</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Comments are devoted to the paper 'Derivation of lump solutions to a variety of Boussinesq equations with distinct dimensions' (Int J Numer Methods Heat Fluid Flow. 2022;32:3072{3082), in which three new generalizations of the classical Boussinesq equation are suggested that were further investigated in several papers. Here it is shown that the equations derived in the above paper are not presented in their canonical forms. It turns out that all three equations can be essentially simplified by the standard technique widely used for linear and quasi-linear PDEs. As a result, it is proved that the equations suggested are not multidimensional generalizations of the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Quantum Fields via Quantum Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The super version of imprimitivity theorem is available now to describe global supersymmetry of systems using the representations of super Lie groups (SLG). This result uses the equivalence between super Harish- Chandra pairs and super Lie groups at the categorigal level and is applicable to super Poincare group and generalizes a smooth SI to super context. We apply the result to build supersymmetric quantum fields. Towards this end, we set up a super fock space of a disjoint union of super Hilbert spaces which is equivalent to super tensoring of boson (even) part symmetrically and that of fermion (odd) part antisymmetrically of the super particle Hilbert space. This leads to a super fock space that is disjoint union of bosonic and fermionic spaces, that is Z2 graded. We derive covariant Weyl operators for light-like fields, with the massless super spinorial multiplet as an illustrative example. First, we build a representation of a light-like little group in terms of Weyl operators. We then use this construction to induce a representation of Poincare group to construct the fields via super version of imprimitivity theorem.</description>

      <title>Nodal count for a random signing of a graph with disjoint cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, connected graph on $n$ vertices, and further assume that $G$ has disjoint cycles. Let $h$ be a real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ (for example, a discrete Schr\"odinger operator). The eigenvalues of $h$ are ordered increasingly, $\lambda_1 \le \cdots \le \lambda_n$, and if $\phi$ is the eigenvector corresponding to $\lambda_k$, the nodal (edge) count $\nu(h,k)$ is the number of edges $(rs)$ such that $ h_{rs}\phi_{r}\phi_{s}&gt;0$. The nodal surplus is $\sigma(h,k)= \nu(h,k) - (k-1)$. Let $h'$ be a random signing of $h$, that is a real symmetric matrix obtained from $h$ by changing the sign of some of its off-diagonal elements. If $h$ satisfies a certain generic condition, we show for each $k$ that the nodal surplus has a binomial distribution $\sigma(h',k)\sim Bin(\beta,\frac{1}{2})$. Part of the proof follows ideas developed by the first author together with Ram Band and Gregory Berkolaiko in a joint unpublished project studying a similar question on quantum graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cylindrically symmetric quantum mechanical systems with position dependent masses (PDM) admitting at least one second order integral of motion are classified. It is proved that there exist 68 such systems which are inequivalent. Among them there are twenty seven superintegrable and twelve maximally superintegrable. The arbitrary elements of the correspondinding Hamiltonians (i.e.,masses and potentials) are presented explicitly.</description>

      <title>Derivation, characterization, and application of complete orthonormal sequences for representing general three-dimensional states of residual stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual stresses are self-equilibrated stresses on unloaded bodies. Owing to their complex origins, it is useful to develop functions that can be linearly combined to represent any sufficiently regular residual stress field. In this work, we develop orthonormal sequences that span the set of all square-integrable residual stress fields on a given three-dimensional region. These sequences are obtained by extremizing the most general quadratic, positive-definite functional of the stress gradient on the set of all sufficiently regular residual stress fields subject to a prescribed normalization condition; each such functional yields a sequence. For the special case where the sixth-order coefficient tensor in the functional is homogeneous and isotropic and the fourth-order coefficient tensor in the normalization condition is proportional to the identity tensor, we obtain a three-parameter subfamily of sequences. Upon a suitable parameter normalization, we find that the viable parameter space corresponds to a semi-infinite strip. For a further specialized spherically symmetric case, we obtain analytical expressions for the sequences and the associated Lagrange multipliers. Remarkably, these sequences change little across the entire parameter strip. To illustrate the applicability of our theoretical findings, we employ three such spherically symmetric sequences to accurately approximate two standard residual stress fields. Our work opens avenues for future exploration into the implications of different sequences, achieved by altering both the spatial distribution and the material symmetry class of the coefficient tensors, toward specific objectives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a particular model of hard spheres that collide inelastically, losing a fixed amount of kinetic energy at each collision. We show that the transport associated to this hard sphere dynamics preserves locally the measure in the phase space. We prove the analog of Alexander's theorem for our model, providing the global well-posedness of the trajectories, for almost every initial datum.</description>

      <title>The categorical spin-statistics theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the spin-statistics theorem for topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in the framework of Atiyah. We incorporate spin via spin structures on bordisms, and represent statistics using super vector spaces. Unitarity is implemented using dagger categories, in a manner that is equivalent to the approach of Freed-Hopkins, who employed $\mathbb{Z}/2$-equivariant functors to address reflection-positivity. A key contribution of our work is the introduction of the notion of fermionically dagger compact categories, which extends the well-established concept of dagger compact categories. We show that both the spin bordism category and the category of super Hilbert spaces are examples of fermionically dagger compact categories. The spin-statistics theorem for TQFTs emerges as a specific case of a more general result concerning symmetric monoidal dagger functors between fermionically dagger compact categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the basic concepts of space and time, the Galilean and pseudo-Euclidean geometry. We use an elementary geometric framework of affine spaces and groups of affine transformations to illustrate the natural relationship between classical mechanics and theory of relativity, which is quite often hidden, despite its fundamental importance. We have emphasized a passage from the group of Galilean motions to the group of Poincar\'e transformations of a plane. In particular, a 1-parametric family of natural deformations of the Poincar\'e group is described. We also visualized the underlying groups of Galilean, Euclidean, and pseudo-Euclidean rotations within the special linear group.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Signalling: Connections between Causal Inference and Space-time Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality is pivotal to our understanding of the world, presenting itself in different forms: information-theoretic and relativistic, the former linked to the flow of information, the latter to the structure of space-time. Leveraging a framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects these two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here, information-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach. First, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as defined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide conditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation, introducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where the observable data does not "faithfully" reflect the causal dependences). In particular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the absence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an order-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for light cones in Minkowski space-times with $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions but violated for $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal models in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed by NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal inference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical space-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel between these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between informational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for studying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in different space-time geometries and theories of information processing.</description>

      <title>Nested cobordisms, Cyl-objects and Temperley-Lieb algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a discrete cobordism category for nested manifolds and nested cobordisms between them. A variation of stratified Morse theory applies in this case, and yields generators for a general nested cobordism category. Restricting to a low-dimensional example of the ``striped cylinder'' cobordism category Cyl, we give a complete set of relations for the generators. With an eye towards the study of TQFTs defined on a nested cobordism category, we describe functors Cyl$\to\mathcal{C}$, which we call Cyl-objects in $\mathcal{C}$, and show that they are related to known algebraic structures such as Temperley-Lieb algebras and cyclic objects. We moreover define novel algebraic constructions inspired by the structure of Cyl-objects, namely a doubling construction on cyclic objects analogous to edgewise subdivision, and a cylindrical bar construction on self-dual objects in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Volume diffusion modelling of a sheared granular gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuum fluid dynamic models based on the Navier-Stokes equations have previously been used to simulate granular media undergoing fluid-like shearing. These models, however, typically fail to predict the flow behaviour in confined environments as non-equilibrium particle effects dominate near walls. We adapt an extended hydrodynamic model for granular flows, which uses a density-gradient dependent ``volume diffusion'' term to correct the viscous stress tensor and heat flux, to simulate the shearing of a granular gas between two rough walls, and with corresponding boundary conditions. We use our volume diffusion model to predict channel flows for a range of mean volume fraction $\bar{\phi}=0.01$--$0.4$, and inter-particle coefficients of restitution $e=0.8$ and $0.9$, and compare with Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations and classical Navier-Stokes equations. Our model is capable of predicting non-uniform pressure, volume fraction and granular temperature, which become more significant for cases with mean volume fraction $\bar{\phi}\sim0.1$, in which we typically observe non-uniform peak density variations, and large volume fraction gradients.</description>

      <title>Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for conservation laws are extremely popular because, for multidimensional problems, they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of finite volume WENO or DG schemes. Such schemes come in two formulations. The very popular classical finite difference WENO (FD-WENO) method (Shu and Osher, J. Comput. Phys., 83 (1989) 32-78) relies two reconstruction steps applied to two split fluxes. However, the method cannot accommodate different types of Riemann solvers and cannot preserve free stream boundary conditions on curvilinear meshes. This limits its utility. The alternative finite difference WENO (AFD-WENO) method can overcome these deficiencies, however, much less work has been done on this method. The reasons are three-fold. First, it is difficult for the casual reader to understand the intricate logic that requires higher order derivatives of the fluxes to be evaluated at zone boundaries. The analytical methods for deriving the update equation for AFD-WENO schemes are somewhat recondite. To overcome that difficulty, we provide an easily accessible script that is based on a computer algebra system in Appendix A of this paper. Second, the method relies on interpolation rather than reconstruction, and WENO interpolation formulae have not been documented in the literature as thoroughly as WENO reconstruction formulae. In this paper, we explicitly provide all necessary WENO interpolation formulae that are needed for implementing AFD-WENO up to ninth order. The third reason is that AFD-WENO requires higher order derivatives of the fluxes to be available at zone boundaries. Since those derivatives are usually obtained by finite differencing the zone-centered fluxes, they become susceptible to a Gibbs phenomenon when the solution ...</description>

      <title>Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Conservative Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher order finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) schemes for conservation laws represent a technology that has been reasonably consolidated. They are extremely popular because, when applied to multidimensional problems, they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of finite volume WENO or DG schemes. They come in two flavors. There is the classical finite difference WENO (FD-WENO) method (Shu and Osher, J. Comput. Phys., 83 (1989) 32-78). However, in recent years there is also an alternative finite difference WENO (AFD-WENO) method which has recently been formalized into a very useful general-purpose algorithm for conservation laws (Balsara et al., Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws, submitted to CAMC (2023)). However, the FD-WENO algorithm has only very recently been formulated for hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products (Balsara et al., Efficient Finite Difference WENO Scheme for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Conservative Products, to appear CAMC (2023)). In this paper we show that there are substantial advantages in obtaining an AFD-WENO algorithm for hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products. Such an algorithm is documented in this paper. We present an AFD-WENO formulation in fluctuation form that is carefully engineered to retrieve the flux form when that is warranted and nevertheless extends to non-conservative products. The method is flexible because it allows any Riemann solver to be used. The formulation we arrive at is such that when non-conservative products are absent it reverts exactly to the formulation in the second citation above which is in exact flux conservation form. The ability to transition to a precise conservation form when non-conservative products are absent ensures, via the Lax-Wendroff theorem, that shock locations will be exactly ...</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the colored ASEP and stochastic six-vertex models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the colored asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and stochastic six vertex (S6V) model with fully packed initial conditions; the states of these models can be encoded by 2-parameter height functions. We show under Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling of time, space, and fluctuations that these height functions converge to the Airy sheet.
  Several corollaries follow. For ASEP and the S6V model under the basic coupling, we consider the 4-parameter height function at position $y$ and time $t$, with a step initial condition at position $x$ and time $s&lt;t$. Under KPZ scaling, we deduce its convergence to the directed landscape. We further prove that ASEPs under the basic coupling, with multiple general initial data, converge to KPZ fixed points coupled through the directed landscape. We moreover show that the colored ASEP stationary measures converge to the stationary horizon.
  The starting point for our Airy sheet convergence result is an embedding of these colored models into a larger structure -- a color-indexed family of coupled line ensembles with an explicit Gibbs property, i.e., a colored Hall-Littlewood line ensemble. The core of our work then becomes to develop a framework to analyze the edge scaling limit of these ensembles.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of sign-shifting interacting dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of non-gravitational interaction between a pressure-less dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) is a phenomenologically rich cosmological domain which has received magnificent attention in the community. In the present article we have considered some interacting scenarios with some novel features: the interaction functions do not depend on the external parameters of the universe, rather, they depend on the intrinsic nature of the dark components; the assumption of unidirectional flow of energy between DM and DE has been extended by allowing the possibility of bidirectional energy flow characterized by some sign shifting interaction functions; and the DE equation of state has been considered to be either constant or dynamical in nature. These altogether add new ingredients in this context, and, we performed the phase space analysis of each interacting scenario in order to understand their global behaviour. According to the existing records in the literature, this combined picture has not been reported elsewhere. From the analyses, we observed that the DE equation of state as well as the coupling parameter(s) of the interaction models can significantly affect the nature of the critical points. It has been found that within these proposed sign shifting interacting scenarios, it is possible to obtain stable late time attractors which may act as global attractors corresponding to an accelerating expansion of the universe. The overall outcomes of this study clearly highlight that the sign shifting interaction functions are quite appealing in the context of cosmological dynamics and they deserve further attention.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Broadcast Structures from von Neumann type interaction Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the mathematical foundations of the recently established theory of Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are multipartite quantum states, encoding an operational notion of objectivity and exhibiting a more advanced form of decoherence. We study SBS in the case of a central system interacting with N environments via the von Neumann-type measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We state and prove a novel sufficient condition for SBS to arise dynamically for finite-dimensional systems. The condition is based on the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization rather than on the Knill-Barnum error estimation used before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular momenta of electromagnetic waves are important both in concepts and applications. In this work, we systematically discuss two types of angular momenta, i.e., spin angular momentum and orbital angular momentum in various cases, e.g., with source and without source, in classical and quantum forms. Numerical results demonstrating how to extract the topological charge of a classical vortex beam by spectral method are also presented.</description>

      <title>Torus algebra and logical operators at low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, we construct an associative algebra $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$, which we call the torus algebra. We prove that the torus algebra is semisimple by explicitly constructing all the simple modules. Suppose that a topological ordered phase described by $\mathscr{C}$ is put on a torus. Physically, each simple module over $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ consists of the low energy states on the torus with one anyon excitation, or equivalently, the ground states on a punctured torus where the anyon is enclosed by the puncture. Elements in $\mathrm{Tor({\mathscr{C}}})$ can be physically interpreted as anyon hopping processes on the torus. We give the precise formula how an arbitrary logical operator on the low energy states on a torus can be realized by moving anyons on the torus. Our work thus provides a theoretical proposal that the low energy states on a torus can serve as topological qudits and one can arbitrarily manipulate them by moving anyons around.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <title>Dagger $n$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coherent definition of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category in terms of equivariance data trivialized on parts of the category. Our main example is the bordism higher category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$. This allows us to define a reflection-positive topological quantum field theory to be a higher dagger functor from $\mathbf{Bord}_{n}^X$ to some target higher dagger category $\mathcal{C}$. Our definitions have a tunable parameter: a group $G$ acting on the $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}$ of $(\infty,n)$-categories. Different choices for $G$ accommodate different flavours of higher dagger structure; the universal choice is $G = \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{Cat}_{(\infty,n)}) = (\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$, which implements dagger involutions on all levels of morphisms. The Stratified Cobordism Hypothesis suggests that there should be a map $\mathrm{PL}(n) \to \operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)})$, where $\mathrm{PL}(n)$ is the group of piecewise-linear automorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}$ the $(\infty,1)$-category of $(\infty,n)$-categories with all adjoints; we conjecture more strongly that $\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbf{AdjCat}_{(\infty,n)}) \cong \mathrm{PL}(n)$. Based on this conjecture we propose a notion of dagger $(\infty,n)$-category with unitary duality or $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger category. We outline how to construct a $\mathrm{PL}(n)$-dagger structure on the fully-extended bordism $(\infty,n)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_n^X$ for any stable tangential structure $X$; our outline restricts to a rigorous construction of a coherent dagger structure on the unextended bordism $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathbf{Bord}_{n,n-1}^X$. The article is a report on the results of a workshop held in Summer 2023, and is intended as a sketch of the big picture and an invitation for more thorough development.</description>

Abstract: We consider the propagation of acoustic waves in a medium with a periodic array of small inclusions of arbitrary shape. The inclusion size $a$ is much smaller than the array period. We show that global gaps do not exist if $a$ is small enough. The notion of local gaps which depends on the choice of the wave vector $\bk$ is introduced and studied. We determine analytically the location of local gaps for the Dirichlet and transmission problems.</description>

      <title>Exact steady states in the asymmetric simple exclusion process beyond one dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a paradigmatic nonequilibrium many-body system that describes the asymmetric random walk of particles with exclusion interactions in a lattice. Although the ASEP is recognized as an exactly solvable model, most of the exact results obtained so far are limited to one-dimensional systems. Here, we construct the exact steady states of the ASEP with closed and periodic boundary conditions in arbitrary dimensions. This is achieved through the concept of transition decomposition, which enables the treatment of the multi-dimensional ASEP as a composite of the one-dimensional ASEPs.</description>

      <title>Tiny fluctuations of the averaging process around its degenerate steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze nonequilibrium fluctuations of the averaging process on $\mathbb T_\varepsilon^d$, a continuous degenerate Gibbs sampler running over the edges of the discrete $d$-dimensional torus. We show that, if we start from a smooth deterministic non-flat interface, recenter, blow-up by a non-standard CLT-scaling factor $\theta_\varepsilon=\varepsilon^{-(d/2+1)}$, and rescale diffusively, Gaussian fluctuations emerge in the limit $\varepsilon\to 0$. These fluctuations are purely dynamical, zero at times $t=0$ and $t=\infty$, and non-trivial for $t\in (0,\infty)$. We fully determine the correlation matrix of the limiting noise, non-diagonal as soon as $d\ge 2$. The main technical challenge in this stochastic homogenization procedure lies in a LLN for a weighted space-time average of squared discrete gradients. We accomplish this through a Poincar\'e inequality with respect to the underlying randomness of the edge updates, a tool from Malliavin calculus in Poisson space. This inequality, combined with sharp gradients' second moment estimates, yields quantitative variance bounds without prior knowledge of the limiting mean. Our method avoids higher (e.g., fourth) moment bounds, which seem inaccessible with the present techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical dynamical $r$-matrices arise naturally in the combinatorial description of the phase space of Chern-Simons theories, either through the inclusion of dynamical sources or through a gauge-fixing procedure involving two punctures. Here we consider classical dynamical $r$-matrices for the family of Lie algebras which arise in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3d gravity, for any value of the cosmological constant. We derive differential equations for classical dynamical $r$-matrices in this case, and show that they can be viewed as generalised complexifications, in a sense which we define, of the equations governing dynamical $r$-matrices for $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})$. We obtain explicit families of solutions and relate them, via Weierstrass factorisation, to solutions found by Feher, Gabor, Marshall, Palla and Pusztai in the context of chiral WZWN models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A special conformal transformation which carries a vacuum gravitational wave into another vacuum one is built by using the M\"obius-redefined time. It can either interchange two different vacuum waves transforming a global one into a sandwich vacuum wave, or transform the gravitational wave into itself. The first type, illustrated by linearly and circularly polarized vacuum plane gravitational waves, interchanges the symmetries and the geodesics. The second type, inspired by molecular physics, is illustrated by an anisotropic generalization of the familiar inverse-square profile with its familiar conformal O(2,1) symmetry. The particle can escape, or perform periodic motion, or fall into the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present our investigation of the study of two variable hypergeometric series, namely Appell $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$ series, and obtain a comprehensive list of its analytic continuations enough to cover the whole real $(x,y)$ plane, except on their singular loci. We also derive analytic continuations of their 3-variable generalization, the Lauricella $F_{D}^{(3)}$ series and the Lauricella-Saran $F_{S}^{(3)}$ series, leveraging the analytic continuations of $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$, which ensures that the whole real $(x,y,z)$ space is covered, except on the singular loci of these functions. While these studies are motivated by the frequent occurrence of these multivariable hypergeometric functions in Feynman integral evaluation, they can also be used whenever they appear in other branches of mathematical physics. To facilitate their practical use, we provide four packages: $\texttt{AppellF1.wl}$, $\texttt{AppellF3.wl}$, $\texttt{LauricellaFD.wl}$, and $\texttt{LauricellaSaranFS.wl}$ in $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$. These packages are applicable for generic as well as non-generic values of parameters, keeping in mind their utilities in the evaluation of the Feynman integrals. We explicitly present various physical applications of these packages in the context of Feynman integral evaluation and compare the results using other means as well. Various $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$ notebooks demonstrating different numerical results are also provided along with this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of recent progress in studying matrix model-2D gravity duality, we reexamine some features of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. After reviewing both sides of the proposed correspondence in this case, a previously unnoted identification between correlation numbers of tachyon operators in certain domain of parameter space and "$p$-deformed volumes", which are certain integral transforms of topological recursion data, is described and clarified. This identification allows us to efficiently study correlation numbers at finite matter central charge. In particular, we obtain an intersection-theoretic formula and the simplest recurrent equations for them, analogous to the ones recently derived for Virasoro minimal string. These formulas might be useful in establishing a more thorough connection between worldsheet and matrix model approaches.</description>

      <title>The ant on loops: Alexander-Orbach conjecture for the critical level set of the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alexander and Orbach (AO) in 1982 conjectured that the simple random walk on critical percolation clusters (also known as the ant in the labyrinth) in Euclidean lattices exhibit mean field behavior; for instance, its spectral dimension is $4/3$. While false in low dimensions, this is expected to be true above the upper critical dimension of six. First rigorous results in this direction go back to Kesten who verified this on the tree. After many developments, in a breakthrough work, Kozma and Nachmias [KN] established the AO conjecture for bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d&gt;19$ and $d&gt;6$ for the spread out lattice. We investigate the validity of the AO conjecture for the critical level set of the Gaussian Free Field (GFF), a canonical dependent percolation model of central importance. In an influential work, Lupu proved that for the cable graph of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (which is obtained by also including the edges), the signed clusters of the associated GFF are given by the corresponding clusters in a Poisson loop soup, thus reducing the analysis to the study of the latter.
  In 2021, Werner put forth an evocative picture for the critical behavior in this setting drawing an analogy with the usual bond case. Building on this, Cai and Ding established the universality of the extrinsic one arm exponent for all $d &gt; 6.$ In this article, we carry this program further, and consider the random walk on sub-sequential limits of the cluster of the origin conditioned to contain far away points. These form candidates for the Incipient Infinite Cluster (IIC), first introduced by Kesten in the planar case. Inspired by the program of [KN], introducing several novel ideas to tackle the long range nature of this model and its effect on the intrinsic geometry of the percolation cluster, we establish that the AO conjecture indeed holds for any sub-sequential IIC, for all large enough dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics for Group Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02321v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase transitions with spontaneous symmetry breaking are expected for group field theories as a basic feature of the geometogenesis scenario. The following paper aims to investigate the equilibrium phase for group field theory by using the ergodic hypothesis on which the Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions must break down. The breaking of the ergodicity can be considered dynamically, by introducing a fictitious time inducing a stochastic process described through a Langevin equation, from which the randomness of the tensor field will be a consequence. This type of equation is considered particularly for complex just-renormalizable Abelian model of rank d = 5, and we study some of their properties by using a renormalization group considering a coarse- graining both in time and space.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that electron-phonon interactions enhance the stability of charge density waves in low-temperature phases of many-electron systems. Our proof method involves an appropriate application of the Pirogov--Sinai theory to electron-phonon systems. Combining our findings with existing results, we obtain rigorous information regarding the low-temperature phase diagram for half-filled electron-phonon systems.</description>

      <title>Decay of the Green's function of the fractional Anderson model and connection to long-range SAW</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a connection between the Green's function of the fractional Anderson model and the two point function of a self-avoiding random walk with long range jumps, adapting a strategy proposed by Schenker in 2015. This connection allows us to exploit results from the theory of self-avoiding random walks to improve previous bounds known for the fractional Anderson model at strong disorder. In particular, we enlarge the range of the disorder parameter where spectral localization occurs. Moreover we prove that the decay of Green's function at strong disorder for any $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$ is arbitrarily close to the decay of the massive resolvent of the corresponding fractional Laplacian, in agreement with the case of the standard Anderson model $\alpha =1$. We also derive upper and lower bounds for the resolvent of the discrete fractional Laplacian with arbitrary mass $m\geq 0,$ that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent study of the non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion, we propose two kinds of dynamical processes of $n \times n$ matrices generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices. As a perturbation $\delta J$ is added at time $m \leq n$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-one matrix. First we report the complicated motions of the ``eigenvalues'' which are numerically calculated. Then we derive the equations which determine the exact-eigenvalue processes. Comparison between the numerical results and the solutions of the equations, coexistence of exact eigenvalues and pseudospectra in the numerical results is clarified. The Catalan numbers play an important role to describe the specified exact eigenvalues. We tried to characterize the numerical results using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without perturbation. Then we report a new phenomenon in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve composed of several closed simple curves osculating each other is reduced in size and embedded as a complicated structure in the pseudospectrum. The asymptotics of the processes in the infinite-matrix limit $n \to \infty$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum particle localization observables on Cauchy surfaces of Minkowski spacetime and their causal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a general notion of spatial localization on spacelike smooth Cauchy surfaces of quantum systems in Minkowski spacetime. The notion is constructed in terms of a coherent family of normalized POVMs, one for each said Cauchy surface. We prove that a family of POVMs of this type automatically satisfies a causality condition which generalizes Castrigiano's one and implies it when restricting to flat spacelike Cauchy surfaces. As a consequence no conflict with Hegerfeldt's theorem arises. We furthermore prove that such families of POVMs do exist for massive Klein-Gordon particles, since some of them are extensions of already known spatial localization observables. These are constructed out of positive definite kernels or are defined in terms of the stress-energy tensor operator. Some further features of these structures are investigated, in particular, the relation with the triple of Newton-Wigner selfadjoint operators and a modified form of Heisenberg inequality in the rest $3$-spaces of Minkowski reference frames</description>

      <title>On nonlinear instability of Prandtl's boundary layers: the case of Rayleigh's stable shear flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:1706.01282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1904, Prandtl introduced his famous boundary layer in order to describe the behavior of solutions of Navier Stokes equations near a boundary as the viscosity goes to $0$. His Ansatz has later been justified for analytic data by R.E. Caflisch and M. Sammartino. In this paper, we prove that his expansion is false, up to $O(\nu^{1/4})$ order terms in $L^\infty$ norm, in the case of solutions with Sobolev regularity, even in cases where the Prandlt's equation is well posed in Sobolev spaces.
  In addition, we also prove that monotonic boundary layer profiles, which are stable when $\nu = 0$, are nonlinearly unstable when $\nu &gt; 0$, provided $\nu$ is small enough, up to $O(\nu^{1/4})$ terms in $L^\infty$ norm.</description>

      <title>On approximation for time-fractional stochastic diffusion equations on the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a two-stage stochastic model to investigate evolution of random fields on the unit sphere $\bS^2$ in $\R^3$. The model is defined by a time-fractional stochastic diffusion equation on $\bS^2$ governed by a diffusion operator with the time-fractional derivative defined in the Riemann-Liouville sense. In the first stage, the model is characterized by a homogeneous problem with an isotropic Gaussian random field on $\bS^2$ as an initial condition. In the second stage, the model becomes an inhomogeneous problem driven by a time-delayed Brownian motion on $\bS^2$. The solution to the model is given in the form of an expansion in terms of complex spherical harmonics. An approximation to the solution is given by truncating the expansion of the solution at degree $L\geq1$. The rate of convergence of the truncation errors as a function of $L$ and the mean square errors as a function of time are also derived. It is shown that the convergence rates depend not only on the decay of the angular power spectrum of the driving noise and the initial condition, but also on the order of the fractional derivative. We study sample properties of the stochastic solution and show that the solution is an isotropic H\"{o}lder continuous random field. Numerical examples and simulations inspired by the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are given to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Stationary measure for six-vertex model on a strip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09111v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic six-vertex model on a strip $$\left\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}^2: 0\leq y\leq x\leq y+N\right\}$$ with two open boundaries. We develop a `matrix product ansatz' method to solve for its stationary measure, based on the compatibility of three types of local moves of any down-right path. The stationary measure on a horizontal path turns out to be a tilting of the stationary measure of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with two open boundaries. Similar to open ASEP, the statistics of this tilted stationary measure as the number of sites $N\rightarrow\infty$ (with the bulk and boundary parameters fixed) also exhibit a phase diagram, which is a tilting of the phase diagram of open ASEP. We study the limit of mean particle density as an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two different arguments using stochastic analysis to construct super-renormalizable tensor field theories, namely the $\mathrm{T}^4_3$ and $\mathrm{T}^4_4$ models. The first approach is the construction of a Langevin dynamic combined with a PDE energy estimate while the second is an application of the variational approach of Barashkov and Gubinelli. By leveraging the melonic structure of divergences, regularising properties of non-local products, and controlling certain random operators, we demonstrate that for tensor field theories these arguments can be significantly simplified in comparison to what is required for $\Phi^4_d$ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate scenarios in which the low-temperature phase of short-range spin glasses comprises thermodynamic states which are nontrivial mixtures of multiple incongruent pure state pairs. We construct a new kind of metastate supported on Gibbs states whose edge overlap values with a reference state fall within a specified range. Using this metastate we show that, in any dimension, the variance of free energy difference fluctuations between pure states within a single mixed Gibbs state with multiple edge overlap values diverges linearly with the volume. We discuss some implications of these results.</description>

      <title>Operator formalism for discretely holomorphic parafermions of the two-color Ashkin-Teller, loop $\mathrm{O} ( 1 )$, staggered eight-vertex, odd eight-vertex, and abelian sandpile models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend an operator formalism, developed by Hongler, Kyt\"ol\"a, and Zahabi in 2012 for the Ising model, to the Ashkin-Teller and loop $\mathrm{O} ( n ) $ models. The formalism is primarily dependent upon notions of massive, and massless, s-holomorphicity of the Ising model, which are respectively satisfied at, and below, the critical temperature, hence allowing for rigorous analyses of the transfer matrix, correlation functions, and lattice fermion operators. From results of another paper, by Tanhayi-Ahari and Rouhani in 2012, which demonstrates that parafermionic observables for the staggered eight-vertex model coincide with those of the Ashkin-Teller model, as well as a 2003 paper, by Wu and Kunz, which establishes a correspondence between the staggered eight-vertex and odd eight-vertex models, we establish further associations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the force-coupling method for hydrodynamic interactions in periodic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficient simulation of fluid-structure interactions at zero Reynolds number requires the use of fast summation techniques in order to rapidly compute the long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions between the structures. One approach for periodic domains involves utilising a compact or exponentially decaying kernel function to spread the force on the structure to a regular grid where the resulting flow and interactions can be computed efficiently using an FFT-based solver. A limitation to this approach is that the grid spacing must be chosen to resolve the kernel and thus, these methods can become inefficient when the separation between the structures is large compared to the kernel width. In this paper, we address this issue for the force-coupling method (FCM) by introducing a modified kernel that can be resolved on a much coarser grid, and subsequently correcting the resulting interactions in a pairwise fashion. The modified kernel is constructed to ensure rapid convergence to the exact hydrodynamic interactions and a positive-splitting of the associated mobility matrix. We provide a detailed computational study of the methodology and establish the optimal choice of the modified kernel width, which we show plays a similar role to the splitting parameter in Ewald summation. Finally, we perform example simulations of rod sedimentation and active filament coordination to demonstrate the performance of fast FCM in application.</description>

      <title>Criteria for Davies Irreducibility of Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems are described by Lindblad master equations, generating a quantum dynamical semigroup. An important concept for such systems is (Davies) irreducibility, i.e., the question whether there exist non-trivial invariant subspaces. Steady states of irreducible systems are unique and faithful, i.e., they have full rank. In the 1970s, Frigerio showed that a system is irreducible if the Lindblad operators span a self-adjoint set with trivial commutant. We discuss a more general and powerful algebraic criterion, showing that a system is irreducible if and only if the multiplicative algebra generated by the Lindblad operators $L_a$ and the operator $K=iH+\sum_a L^\dagger_aL_a$, involving the Hamiltonian $H$, is the entire operator space. Examples for two-level systems, show that a change of Hamiltonian terms as well as the addition or removal of dissipators can render a reducible system irreducible and vice versa. Examples for many-body systems show that a large class of spin chains can be rendered irreducible by dissipators on just one or two sites. Additionally, we discuss the decisive differences between (Davies) reducibility and Evans reducibility for quantum channels and dynamical semigroups which has lead to some confusion in the recent physics literature, especially, in the context of boundary-driven systems. We give a criterion for quantum reducibility in terms of associated classical Markov processes and, lastly, discuss the relation of the main result to the stabilization of pure states and argue that systems with local Lindblad operators cannot stabilize pure Fermi-sea states.</description>

      <title>Local isometric immersions and breakdown of manifolds determined by Cauchy problems of the Degasperis-Procesi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that both local and non-local formulations of the Degasperis-Procesi equation possess a pseudospherical nature. As a result, solutions determined by Cauchy problems with non-trivial initial data and a minimal specific regularity define an orthonormal coframe for a pseudospherical metric within a designated strip. While the region is entirely described by the initial condition, the one-forms are determined by the corresponding solutions. Moreover, we establish that any non-trivial initial condition yields a second fundamental form, which is locally determined within the strip. The surface may collapse within a finite-height strip when the initial condition leads to wave breaking. We determine conditions for the coframe to be defined on the upper plane. We investigate possible integrability structures related to the triad of fundamental one-forms.</description>

      <title>Spectral fluctuations of multiparametric complex matrix ensembles: evidence of a single parameter dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of complex matrices with zero mean and variances with different decay routes away from the diagonals. As the latter mimics different degree of effective sparsity among the matrix elements, such ensembles can serve as good models for a wide range of phase transitions e.g. localization to delocalization in non-Hermitian systems or Hermitian to non-Hermitian one. Our analysis reveals a rich behavior hidden beneath the spectral statistics e.g. a crossover of the spectral statistics from Poisson to Ginibre universality class with changing variances for finite matrix size, an abrupt transition for infinite matrix size and the role of complexity parameter, a single functional of all system parameters, as a criteria to determine critical point. We also confirm the theoretical predictions in \cite{psgs, psnh}, regarding the universality of the spectral statistics in non-equilibrium regime of non-Hermitian systems characterized by the complexity parameter.</description>

      <title>Algebraic curves as a source of separable multi-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we systematically consider various ways of generating integrable and separable Hamiltonian systems in canonical and in non-canonical representations from algebraic curves on the plane. In particular, we consider St\"ackel transform between two pairs of St\"ackel systems, generated by 2n-parameter algebraic curves on the plane, as well as Miura maps between St\"ackel systems generated by (n+N)-parameter algebraic curves, leading to multi-Hamiltonian representation of these systems.</description>

      <title>Finkelstein-Rubinstein constraints from ADHM data and rational maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish simple formulae for computing Finkelstein-Rubinstein signs for Skyrme fields generated in two ways: from instanton ADHM data, and from rational maps. This may be used to compute homotopy classes of general loops in the configuration spaces of skyrmions, and as a result provide a useful tool for a quantum treatment beyond rigid-body quantisation of skyrmions.</description>

      <title>The Fefferman-Phong uncertainty principle for representations of Lie groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new uncertainty principle for square-integrable irreducible unitary representations of connected Lie groups. The concentration of the matrix coefficients is measured in terms of weighted $L^p$ norms, with weights in the local Muckenhoupt class $A_{\infty,{\rm loc}}$ associated with a subRiemannian left-invariant metric and a relatively invariant measure. The result is reminiscent of the Fefferman-Phong uncertainty principle, and is new even for the Schr\"odinger representation of the reduced Heisenberg group, which corresponds to the short-time Fourier transform. As an application, we give an optimal estimate of the order of magnitude of the bottom of the spectrum and of the essential spectrum of semiclassical anti-Wick operators in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonnegative symbol $a$ in the class $A_{\infty}$ (in particular, for polynomial symbols). Precisely, we show that the infimum $\inf _{(x_0,\omega_0)\in{\mathbb{R}^{2d}}} -\!\!\!\!\!\int_{B((x_0,\omega_0),\sqrt{h})} a(x,\omega)\, dx\,d\omega$ represents (up to multiplicative constants) both a lower bound and an upper bound for the bottom of the spectrum, uniformly with respect to $h&gt;0$. Similarly the quantity $$\liminf_{(x_0,\omega_0)\to\infty} -\!\!\!\!\!\!\int_{B((x_0,\omega_0),\sqrt{h})} a(x,\omega)\, dx\,d\omega$$ represents both a lower bound and an upper bound for the bottom of the essential spectrum, uniformly with respect to $h&gt;0$. Similar results are proved for semiclassical symbol classes.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of Soliton for the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation in the $L^2$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the orbital stability of the 1-soliton solution for the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation under perturbations in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$. We demonstrate this stability by utilizing the B\"acklund transformation associated with the Lax pair and by applying the first conservation quantity in $L^2(\mathbb{R}).$</description>
