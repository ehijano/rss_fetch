      <title>Adaptive partition Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Factor Analysis has traditionally been utilized across diverse disciplines to extrapolate latent traits that influence the behavior of multivariate observed variables. Historically, the focus has been on analyzing data from a single study, neglecting the potential study-specific variations present in data from multiple studies. Multi-study factor analysis has emerged as a recent methodological advancement that addresses this gap by distinguishing between latent traits shared across studies and study-specific components arising from artifactual or population-specific sources of variation. In this paper, we extend the current methodologies by introducing novel shrinkage priors for the latent factors, thereby accommodating a broader spectrum of scenarios -- from the absence of study-specific latent factors to models in which factors pertain only to small subgroups nested within or shared between the studies. For the proposed construction we provide conditions for identifiability of factor loadings and guidelines to perform straightforward posterior computation via Gibbs sampling. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method exhibits competing performance across a variety of scenarios compared to existing methods, yet providing richer insights. The practical benefits of our approach are further illustrated through applications to bird species co-occurrence data and ovarian cancer gene expression data.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Polychoric Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polychoric correlation is often an important building block in the analysis of rating data, particularly for structural equation models. However, the commonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to misspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through violations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that is designed to be robust to partial misspecification of the polychoric model, that is, the model is only misspecified for an unknown fraction of observations, for instance (but not limited to) careless respondents. In contrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type or degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation and is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed. We demonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in simulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration. In the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML differ substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the presence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.</description>
