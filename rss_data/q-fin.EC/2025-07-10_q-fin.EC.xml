      <title>Electricity Market Predictability: Virtues of Machine Learning and Links to the Macroeconomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With stakeholder-level in-market data, we conduct a comparative analysis of machine learning (ML) for forecasting electricity prices in Singapore, spanning 15 individual models and 4 ensemble approaches. Our empirical findings justify the three virtues of ML models: (1) the virtue of capturing non-linearity, (2) the complexity (Kelly et al., 2024) and (3) the l2-norm and bagging techniques in a weak factor environment (Shen and Xiu, 2024). Simulation also supports the first virtue. Penalizing prediction correlation improves ensemble performance when individual models are highly correlated. The predictability can be translated into sizable economic gains under the mean-variance framework. We also reveal significant patterns of time-series heterogeneous predictability across macro regimes: predictability is clustered in expansion, volatile market and extreme geopolitical risk periods. Our feature importance results agree with the complex dynamics of Singapore's electricity market after de regulation, yet highlight its relatively supply-driven nature with the continued presence of strong regulatory influences.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Measure of Voter Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a definition of ideological polarization of an electorate around a particular central point. By being flexible about the location or width of the center, this measure enables the researcher to analyze polarization around any point of interest. The paper then applies this approach to US voter survey data between 2004 and 2020, showing how polarization between right-of-center voters and the rest of the electorate was increasing gradually, while polarization between left-wingers and the rest was originally constant and then rose steeply. It also shows how, following elections, polarization around left-wing positions decreased while polarization around right-wing positions increased. Furthermore, the paper shows how this measure can be used to find cleavage points around which polarization changed the most. I then show how ideological polarization as defined here is related to other phenomena, such as affective polarization and increased salience of divisive issues.</description>

      <title>The Pandora's Box Problem with Sequential Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pandora's box problem (Weitzman 1979) is a core model in economic theory that captures an agent's (Pandora's) search for the best alternative (box). We study an important generalization of the problem where the agent can either fully open boxes for a certain fee to reveal their exact values or partially open them at a reduced cost. This introduces a new tradeoff between information acquisition and cost efficiency. We establish a hardness result and employ an array of techniques in stochastic optimization to provide a comprehensive analysis of this model. This includes (1) the identification of structural properties of the optimal policy that provide insights about optimal decisions; (2) the derivation of problem relaxations and provably near-optimal solutions; (3) the characterization of the optimal policy in special yet non-trivial cases; and (4) an extensive numerical study that compares the performance of various policies, and which provides additional insights about the optimal policy. Throughout, we show that intuitive threshold-based policies that extend the Pandora's box optimal solution can effectively guide search decisions.</description>

      <title>Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.</description>

      <title>Trial Length, Pricing, and Rationally Inattentive Customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "free trial" followed by automatic renewal is a dominant business model in the digital economy. Standard models explain trials as a mechanism for consumers to learn their valuation for a product. We propose a complementary theory based on the rational inattention framework. Consumers know their valuation but face a cognitive cost to remember to cancel an unwanted subscription. We model this using a Shannon entropy-based cost of information processing, where a consumer's baseline attention level decays with the length of the trial period. This creates a novel trade-off for a monopolist firm: a longer trial increases "inattentive revenue" from consumers who fail to cancel, but it also lowers ex-ante consumer utility, making the initial offer less attractive. We show that this trade-off leads to an interior optimal trial length, even for products where value-learning is instantaneous. Our model, under standard assumptions about demand elasticity and the distribution of consumer valuations, generates sharp, testable predictions about the relationship between contract terms. We find that the optimal renewal price and trial length are complements: firms offering longer trials will also set higher post-trial prices. We analyze the impact of policies aimed at curbing consumer exploitation, such as "click-to-cancel" regulations. We show that such policies, by making attention effectively cheaper, lead firms to reduce trial lengths. The effect on price depends directly on the elasticity of demand from loyal subscribers. We also extend the model to include paid trials, showing that introductory prices and trial lengths act as strategic substitutes. Our framework provides a micro-founded explanation for common features of subscription contracts and offers a new lens through which to evaluate consumer protection policies in digital markets.</description>

      <title>The gradual transformation of inland areas -- human plowing, horse plowing and equity incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many modern areas have not learned their lessons and often hope for the wisdom of later generations, resulting in them only possessing modern technology and difficult to iterate ancient civilizations. At present, there is no way to tell how we should learn from history and promote the gradual upgrading of civilization. Therefore, we must tell the history of civilization's progress and the means of governance, learn from experience to improve the comprehensive strength and survival ability of civilization, and achieve an optimal solution for the tempering brought by conflicts and the reduction of internal conflicts. Firstly, we must follow the footsteps of history and explore the reasons for the long-term stability of each country in conflict, including providing economic benefits to the people and means of suppressing them; then, use mathematical methods to demonstrate how we can achieve the optimal solution at the current stage. After analysis, we can conclude that the civilization transformed from human plowing to horse plowing can easily suppress the resistance of the people and provide them with the ability to resist; The selection of rulers should consider multiple institutional aspects, such as exams, elections, and drawing lots; Economic development follows a lognormal distribution and can be adjusted by expected value and variance. Using a lognormal distribution with the maximum value to divide equity can adjust the wealth gap.</description>
