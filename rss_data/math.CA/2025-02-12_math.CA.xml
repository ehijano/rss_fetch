      <title>d-plane transform: unique and non-unique continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-plane transform maps functions to their integrals over $d$-planes in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We study the following question: if a function vanishes in a bounded open set, and its $d$-plane transform vanishes on all $d$-planes intersecting the same set, does the function vanish identically? For $d$ an even integer, we show by producing an explicit counterexample, that neither the $d$-plane transform, nor its normal operator has this property. On the other hand, an even stronger property holds when $d$ is odd, where the normal operator vanishing to infinite order at a point, along with the function vanishing on an open set containing that point, is sufficient to conclude that the function vanishes identically.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Approximation in $ L^2 $ of the Double Exponential via Complex Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the polynomial approximation problem in $L^2(\mu_1)$ where $\mu_1(dx) = e^{-|x|}/2 dx$. We show that for any absolutely continuous function $f$, $$ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \log^2(e+k) \langle f, P_k \rangle^2 \ \leq C \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}} \log^2(e+\lvert x \rvert) f^2 \, d\mu_1 \ + \ \int_{\mathbb{R}} (f')^2 \, d\mu_1 \right) $$
  for some universal constant $C&gt;0$, where $(P_k)_{k \in N}$ are the orthonormal polynomials associated with $\mu_1$. This inequality is tight in the sense that $\log^2(e +k)$ on the left hand-side cannot be replaced by $a_k \log^2(e +k)$ with a sequence $a_k \longrightarrow \infty$.
  When the right hand-side is bounded this inequality implies a logarithmic rate of approximation for $f$, which was previously obtained by Lubinsky. We also obtain some rates of approximation for the product measure $\mu_1^{\otimes d}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ via a tensorization argument. Our proof relies on an explicit formula for the generating function of orthonormal polynomials associated with the weight $\frac{1}{2\cosh(\pi x/2)}$ and some complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>

Abstract: We show that the X-ray transform with directions restricted along the moment curve possesses extremizers and that $L^p$-normalized extremizing sequences are precompact modulo symmetry. Our approach advances the Lorentz space method of Christ to a mixed norm Lebesgue space setting.</description>

Abstract: This is a discussion of miscellaneous summation, integration and transformation formulas obtained using Fourier analysis. The topics covered are: Series of the form $\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}} c_ne^{\pi i \gamma n^2}$; Fusion of integrals, and in particular fusion of $q$-beta integrals related to Gauss-Fourier transform, and a related family of eigenfunctions of the cosine Fourier transform; Summation formulas of the type $\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{\chi(n)}{n}\,\varphi(n)$ with Dirichlet characters; Trigonometric Fourier series expansion of hypergeometric functions of the argument $\sin^2x$; Modifications of the inverse tangent integral and identities for corresponding infinite products.</description>

      <title>The extremal values of the ratio of differences of power mean, arithmetic mean, and geometric mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper the maximum and the minimum of the ratio of the difference of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, and the difference of the power mean and the geometric mean of $n$ variables, are studied. A new optimization argument was used which reduces $n$ variable optimization problem to a single variable. All possible cases of the choice of the power mean and the choice of the number of variables of the means are studied. The obtained results generalize and complete the earlier results which were either for specific intervals of power means or for small number of variables of the means. Some of the results are formulated as the best constant inequalities involving interpolation of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean. The monotonicity and convergence of these best constants are also studied.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations for Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10726v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the dual variational principle and the saddle point reduction we use the abstract bifurcation theory recently developed by author in previous work to prove many new bifurcation results for solutions of four types of Hamiltonian boundary value problems nonlinearly depending on parameters. The most interesting and important among them are those alternative results which can only be proved with our generalized versions of the famous Rabinowitz's alternative bifurcation theorem.</description>

      <title>Extremal problems in BMO and VMO involving the Garsia norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an $L^2$ function $f$ on the unit circle $\mathbb T$, we put $$\Phi_f(z):=\mathcal P(|f|^2)(z)-|\mathcal Pf(z)|^2,\qquad z\in\mathbb D,$$ where $\mathbb D$ is the open unit disk and $\mathcal P$ is the Poisson integral operator. The Garsia norm $\|f\|_G$ is then defined as $\sup_{z\in\mathbb D}\Phi_f(z)^{1/2}$, and the space ${\rm BMO}$ is formed by the functions $f\in L^2$ with $\|f\|_G&lt;\infty$. If $\|f\|^2_G=\Phi_f(z_0)$ for some point $z_0\in\mathbb D$, then $f$ is said to be a norm-attaining ${\rm BMO}$ function, written as $f\in{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$. Note that ${\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$ contains ${\rm VMO}$, the space of functions with vanishing mean oscillation. We study, first, the functions $f$ in $L^\infty$ (as well as in $L^\infty\cap{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$) with the property that $\|f\|_G=\|f\|_\infty$. The analytic case, where $L^\infty$ gets replaced by $H^\infty$, is discussed in more detail. Secondly, we prove that every function $f\in{\rm BMO}_{\rm na}$ with $\|f\|_G=1$ is an extreme point of ${\rm ball}\,({\rm BMO})$, the unit ball of ${\rm BMO}$ with respect to the Garsia norm. This implies that the extreme points of ${\rm ball}\,({\rm VMO})$ are precisely the unit-norm ${\rm VMO}$ functions. As another consequence, we arrive at an amusing "geometric" characterization of inner functions.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential rings on species and derived structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>
