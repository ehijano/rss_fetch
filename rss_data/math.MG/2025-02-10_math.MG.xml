      <title>Pal's isominwidth problem in the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on possible hyperbolic versions of the classical Pal isominwidth inequality in R^2 from 1921, which states that for a fixed minimal width, the regular triangle has minimal area. We note that the isominwidth problem is still wide open in R^n for n&gt;2. Recent work on the isominwidth problem on the sphere S^2 shows that the solution is the regular spherical triangle when the width is at most \pi/2 according to Bezdek and Blekherman, while Freyer and Sagmeister proved that the minimizer is the polar of a spherical Reuleaux triangle when the minimal width is greater than \pi/2.
  In this paper, the hyperbolic isominwidth problem is discussed with respect to the probably most natural notion of width due to Lassak in the hyperbolic space H^n where strips bounded by a supporting hyperplane and a corresponding hypersphere are considered. On the one hand, we show that the volume of a convex body of given minimal Lassak width w&gt;0 in H^n might be arbitrarily small; therefore, the isominwidth problem for convex bodies in H^n does not make sense. On the other hand, in the two-dimensional case, we prove that among horocyclically convex bodies of given Lassak width in H^2, the area is minimized by the regular horocyclic triangle.</description>

      <title>Unitarily invariant valuations on convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14658v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous, dually epi-translation invariant valuations on the space of finite-valued convex functions on $\mathbb{C}^n$ that are invariant under the unitary group are investigated. It is shown that elements belonging to the dense subspace of smooth valuations admit a unique integral representation in terms of two families of Monge-Amp\`ere-type operators. In addition, it is proved that homogeneous valuations are uniquely determined by restrictions to subspaces of appropriate dimension and that this information is encoded in the Fourier-Laplace transform of the associated Goodey-Weil distributions. These results are then used to show that a continuous unitarily invariant valuation is uniquely determined by its restriction to a certain finite family of subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$.</description>
