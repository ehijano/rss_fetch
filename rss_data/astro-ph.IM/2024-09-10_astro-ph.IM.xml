      <title>Reconstruction methods for the phase-shifted Zernike wavefront sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zernike wavefront sensor (ZWFS) stands out as one of the most sensitive optical systems for measuring the phase of an incoming wavefront, reaching photon efficiencies close to the fundamental limit. This quality, combined with the fact that it can easily measure phase discontinuities, has led to its widespread adoption in various wavefront control applications, both on the ground but also for future space-based instruments. Despite its advantages, the ZWFS faces a significant challenge due to its extremely limited dynamic range, making it particularly challenging for ground-based operations. To address this limitation, one approach is to use the ZWFS after a general adaptive optics (AO) system; however, even in this scenario, the dynamic range remains a concern. This paper investigates two optical configurations of the ZWFS: the conventional setup and its phase-shifted counterpart, which generates two distinct images of the telescope pupil. We assess the performance of various reconstruction techniques for both configurations, spanning from traditional linear reconstructors to gradient-descent-based methods. The evaluation encompasses simulations and experimental tests conducted on the Santa cruz Extreme Adaptive optics Lab (SEAL) bench at UCSC. Our findings demonstrate that certain innovative reconstruction techniques introduced in this study significantly enhance the dynamic range of the ZWFS, particularly when utilizing the phase-shifted version.</description>

      <title>Alignment of three mirror anastigmat telescopes using a multilayered stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a telescope doesn't reach a reasonable point spread function on the detector or detectable wavefront quality after initial assembly, a coarse phase alignment on-sky is crucial. Before utilizing a closed loop adaptive optics system, the observatory needs a strategy to actively align the telescope sufficiently for fine wavefront sensing. This paper presents a method of early-stage alignment using a stochastic parallel-gradient-descent (SPGD) algorithm which performs random perturbations to the optics of a three mirror anastigmat telescope design. The SPGD algorithm will drive the telescope until the wavefront error is below the acceptable range of the fine adaptive optics system to hand the telescope over. The focused spot size over the field of view is adopted as a feed parameter to the SPGD algorithm and wavefront peak-to-valley error values are monitored to directly compare our mechanical capabilities to our alignment goal of diffraction limited imaging and fine wavefront sensing.</description>

      <title>Improving Early Detection of Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars Using CNNs and FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) with possible telescope follow-ups opens a window to ground-breaking discoveries in the field of multi-messenger astronomy. With the improved sensitivity of current and future GW detectors, more BNS detections are expected in the future. Therefore, enhancing low-latency GW search algorithms to achieve rapid speed, high accuracy, and low computational cost is essential. One innovative solution to reduce latency is the use of machine learning (ML) methods embedded in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we present a novel \texttt{WaveNet}-based method, leveraging the state-of-the-art ML model, to produce early-warning alerts for BNS systems. Using simulated GW signals embedded in Gaussian noise from the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors' third observing run (O3) as a proof-of-concept dataset, we demonstrate significant performance improvements. Compared to the current leading ML-based early-warning system, our approach enhances detection accuracy from 66.81\% to 76.22\% at a 1\% false alarm probability. Furthermore, we evaluate the time, energy, and economical cost of our model across CPU, GPU, and FPGA platforms, showcasing its potential for deployment in real-time gravitational wave detection pipelines.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we report the on-going progresses of the project FATE, an operational automatic forecast system conceived to deliver forecasts of a set of astroclimatic and atmospheric parameters having the aim to support the science operations (i.e. the Service Mode) at the Very Large Telescope. The project has been selected at conclusion of an international open call for tender opened by ESO and it fits with precise technical specifications. In this contribution we will present the ultimate goals of this service once it will be integrated in the VLT operations, the forecasts performances at present time and the state of the art of the project. FATE is supposed to draw the roadmap towards the optical turbulence forecast for the ELT.</description>

      <title>Optical turbulence forecast for the European Solar Telescope (EST): the challenge of the day-time regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we present preliminary results of a study applied to the Observatories of Roque de Los Muchachos (La Palma) and Teide (Tenerife) in Canary Islands aiming to investigate the possibility to implement an automatic system for the optical turbulence forecasting for the European Solar Telescope (EST) telescope. The study has been carried out in the context of the SOLARNET project and the two mentioned sites were the pre-selected sites for EST. This analysis aimed to investigate the possibility to extend the methodology of the forecast of the optical turbulence developed by our team and performed on top-class ground-based telescopes dedicated to night time observations such as ALTA (@ LBT) and FATE (@ VLT) to the day-time regime. As an ancillary output our very preliminary analysis concludes, that the two sites of Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (ORM) and Teide Observatory (TO) show comparable characteristics during the day time. Considering that the site of EST has been already identified to be at ORM this can be considered a very useful information from a scientific point of view.</description>

      <title>Spectral interferometric wavefront sensing: a solution for petalometry at Subaru/SCExAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The petaling effect, induced by pupil fragmentation from the telescope spider, drastically affects the performance of high contrast instruments by inducing core splitting on the PSF. Differential piston/tip/tilt aberrations within each optically separated fragment of the pupil are poorly measured by commonly used Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. We here pursue a design of dedicated low-order wavefront sensor -- or petalometers -- to complement the main AO. Interferometric devices sense differential aberrations between fragments with optimal sensitivity; their weakness though is their limitation to wrapped phase measurements. We show that by combining multiple spectral channels, we increase the capture range for petaling aberrations beyond several microns, enough to disambiguate one-wave wrapping errors made by the main AO system. We propose here to implement a petalometer from the multi-wavelength imaging mode of the VAMPIRES visible-light instrument, deployed on SCExAO at the Subaru Telescope. The interferometric measurements obtained in four spectral channels through a 7 hole non-redundant mask allow us to effiiently reconstruct diffierential piston between pupil petals.</description>

      <title>Astroaccesible: A multi-messenger outreach for a multi-messenger science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution summarizes the main activities and objectives of the outreach project Astroaccesible, whose main aim is to carry the teaching and diffusion of astronomy among all kinds of collectives, focusing on blind and visually impaired (BVI) people. This project is led by a blind astronomer and aims to use a variety of resources based on different sensory channels, avoiding limiting the transmission of concepts to visual perception. This principle favors inclusion and benefits everyone, as the information is not presented using just one channel. This strategy is especially convenient for the nowadays typical data acquisition, where a variety of sources of information, not solely based on the collection of different spectral domains of electromagnetic radiation, is used. Moreover, the study of new multi-messenger astronomy could be much better understood using a multi-messenger teaching approach, favoring inclusion, motivation, and creativity.</description>

      <title>System performance of a cryogenic test-bed for the time-division multiplexing readout for NewAthena X-IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) is an instrument of ESA's future NewAthena space observatory, with the goal to provide high-energy resolution ($&lt;$ 4 eV at X-ray energies up to 7 keV) and high-spatial resolution (9") spectroscopic imaging over the X-ray energy range from 200 eV to 12 keV, by means of an array of about 1500 transition-edge sensors (TES) read out via SQUID time-division multiplexing (TDM). In 2022, to aid in the transfer of TDM readout technology from the laboratory toward flight hardware, our team commissioned a new TDM-based laboratory test-bed at SRON. This setup hosts an array of $75\times 75\ \mu$m$^2$ TESs that are read out via 2-column $\times$ 32-row TDM. A system component that is critical to high-performance operation is the wiring harness that connects the room-temperature electronics to the cryogenic readout componentry. In November 2023, we implemented a re-designed flex harness, which in the SRON test-bed has a length close to what is envisioned for the X-IFU flight harness. We report here on our characterization of the TDM system with the new flex harness, which allowed the system to achieve a co-added energy resolution at a level of 2.7~eV FWHM at 6~keV via 32-row readout. In addition, we provide an outlook on the upcoming integration of TDM readout into the X-IFU Focal-Plane Assembly Development Model.</description>

      <title>Roadmap of GHOST@Gemini's Precision Radial Velocity Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GHOST is a newly operational optical fiber-fed high-resolution spectrograph at the Gemini South 8.1m telescope. It currently offers the choice of two resolution modes captured by one (or two) input IFUs with a FOV of 1.2'' and a spectral resolving power of 56,000 and 76,000 for the unbinned CCDs. At the high-resolution mode, one can also instigate a simultaneous ThXe calibration lamp, which along with a simultaneous pseudo-slit profile constructed from reformatting the input IFU image will allow for precision radial velocity measurements. Here we talk about the proposed roadmap towards full queue operations, potential upgrades, and the error terms contributing to the final on-sky RV precision, which is estimated to be in the 1-10 m s$^{-1}$ range.</description>

      <title>Application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Removing Telescope Beam Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces PI-AstroDeconv, a physics-informed semi-supervised learning method specifically designed for removing beam effects in astronomical telescope observation systems. The method utilizes an encoder-decoder network architecture and combines the telescope's point spread function or beam as prior information, while integrating fast Fourier transform accelerated convolution techniques into the deep learning network. This enables effective removal of beam effects from astronomical observation images. PI-AstroDeconv can handle multiple PSFs or beams, tolerate imprecise measurements to some extent, and significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of image deconvolution. Therefore, this algorithm is particularly suitable for astronomical data processing that does not rely on annotated data. To validate the reliability of the algorithm, we used the SKA Science Data Challenge 3a datasets and compared it with the CLEAN deconvolution method at the 2-D matter power spectrum level. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only restores details and reduces blurriness in celestial images at the pixel level but also more accurately recovers the true neutral hydrogen power spectrum at the matter power spectrum level.</description>

      <title>jaxspec : a fast and robust Python library for X-ray spectral fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Inferring spectral parameters from X-ray data is one of the cornerstones of high-energy astrophysics, and is achieved using software stacks that have been developed over the last twenty years and more. However, as models get more complex and spectra reach higher resolutions, these established software solutions become more feature-heavy, difficult to maintain and less efficient. Aims. We present jaxspec, a Python package for performing this task quickly and robustly in a fully Bayesian framework. Based on the JAX ecosystem, jaxspec allows the generation of differentiable likelihood functions compilable on core or graphical process units (resp. CPU and GPU), enabling the use of robust algorithms for Bayesian inference. Methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of jaxspec samplers, in particular the No U-Turn Sampler, using a composite model and comparing what we obtain with the existing frameworks. We also demonstrate its ability to process high-resolution spectroscopy data and using original methods, by reproducing the results of the Hitomi collaboration on the Perseus cluster, while solving the inference problem using variational inference on a GPU. Results. We obtain identical results when compared to other softwares and approaches, meaning that jaxspec provides reliable results while being $\sim 10$ times faster than existing alternatives. In addition, we show that variational inference can produce convincing results even on high-resolution data in less than 10 minutes on a GPU. Conclusions. With this package, we aim to pursue the goal of opening up X-ray spectroscopy to the existing ecosystem of machine learning and Bayesian inference, enabling researchers to apply new methods to solve increasingly complex problems in the best possible way. Our long-term ambition is the scientific exploitation of the data from the newAthena X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU).</description>

      <title>ESCAPE project. CAPyBARA: a Roman Coronagraph simulator for post-processing methods development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph Instrument will be the first space facility equipped with deformable mirrors (DMs). These will lead to reach a contrast of $10^{-8}$ or better in a dark hole between $3-9 \lambda/D$. Post-processing techniques play an important role in increasing the contrast limits. Our work investigates how DMs can be used to calibrate the instrument response to controlled wavefront error maps and to improve the post-processing performance. To this goal, we are developing a simulation pipeline, CAPyBARA, that includes both a propagation model of the Coronagraph and a post-processing module and produces starlight subtracted images of a science target. This pipeline will allow us to investigate alternative observing strategies and test their performance for the Roman Coronagraph. Here we present the first version of the simulator: it currently reproduces the optical propagation, which consists in the hybrid Lyot coronagraph optical structure and dark-hole digging technique (Electric Field Conjugation coupled with $\beta$-bumping), the environment (quasi-static aberration) and the post-processing. With it, we mimic a Coronagraph Instrument observing sequence, which consists in first acquiring reference star data before slewing to the scientific target, and we investigate how the evolution of quasi-static aberrations deteriorate the contrast limit in the dark hole. We simulate a science target with planets at high contrast with their star and we perform a first post-processing analysis with classical subtraction techniques. Here we present the CAPyBARA simulator, as well as some first results. The next step will be to generate PSF libraries by injecting pre-calibrated probes on the DMs (in open loop) during the reference star acquisition and compute a PCA model. Later, we will compare the performance gain obtained with the modulated-DM reference library over standard approaches (RDI).</description>

      <title>Unveiling habitable planets: Toy coronagraph tackles the exozodiacal dust challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets within habitable zones is challenging because faint signals can be obscured by exozodiacal dust, analogous to our solar system's zodiacal dust. This dust scatters starlight, creating a bright background noise. This paper introduces Toy Coronagraph, a Python package designed to quantify the impact of this dust on exoplanet detection. It takes circularly symmetric disk images point spread functions (PSFs), and exoplanet orbital parameters as input, generating key metrics like contrast curves, signal-to-noise ratios, and dynamic visualizations of exoplanet motion under the dust background. The package also provides tools for generating vortex coronagraph PSFs and includes example disk images. Toy Coronagraph empowers researchers to understand exozodiacal dust, develop mitigation strategies, and optimize future telescope designs and mission time, ultimately advancing the search for potentially habitable worlds. Future work will focus on handling non-circularly symmetric inputs, incorporating realistic noise models, and estimating exoplanet yield rates for future space telescope missions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of a telescope observation time proposal is a recurring activity in observational astronomy. It is a necessary investment of time and effort to obtain data to advance a research topic. Therefore, the success of an observation proposal is a condition for progress in observational research. This guide was created to offer a straightforward, practical, and comprehensive resource for applicants who are preparing a Gemini Observatory proposal. It reviews the fundamentals of an observation proposal, including its content and evaluation criteria, to help applicants organize their submissions effectively and improve specific aspects of their presentations. This manuscript is inspired by the recommendations of the User Advisory Council established in the documents ''Criterios de evaluaci\'on de propuestas por parte del NTAC'' (National Time Allocation Committee), ''Consideraciones b\'asicas para la presentaci\'on de propuestas Gemini'', and in experiences of members of the NTAC.</description>

      <title>Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at Gemini-South: Instrument performance and integration, first science, and next steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gemini South telescope is now equipped with a new high-resolution spectrograph called GHOST (the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph). This instrument provides high-efficiency, high-resolution spectra covering 347-1060 nm in a single exposure of either one or two targets simultaneously, along with precision radial velocity spectroscopy utilizing an internal calibration source. It can operate at a spectral element resolving power of either 76000 or 56000, and can reach a SNR$\sim$5 in a 1hr exposure on a V$\sim$20.8 mag target in median site seeing, and dark skies (per resolution element). GHOST was installed on-site in June 2022, and we report performance after full integration to queue operations in November 2023, in addition to scientific results enabled by the integration observing runs. These results demonstrate the ability to observe a wide variety of bright and faint targets with high efficiency and precision. With GHOST, new avenues to explore high-resolution spectroscopy have opened up to the astronomical community. These are described, along with the planned and potential upgrades to the instrument.</description>

      <title>BROWDIE: a New Machine Learning Model for Searching T&amp;Y Dwarfs Using the UKIDSS J, H, K Band Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new T, Y dwarf search model using machine learning (ML), called the "BROWn Dwarf Image Explorer (BROWDIE). Brown dwarfs (BD) are estimated to make up 25 percent of all celestial objects in the Galaxy, yet only a small number have been thoroughly studied. Homogeneous and complete samples of BDs are essential to advance the studies. However, due to their faintness, conducting spectral studies of BDs can be challenging. T\&amp;Y brown dwarfs, a redder and fainter subclass of BDs, are even harder to detect. As a result, only a few T\&amp;Y dwarfs have been extensively studied. Numerous attempts, including ML using various color band observations, have been made to identify BDs based on their colors. However, those models often require a large number of color observations, which can be a limitation. This study implemented an ML model by utilizing data from the J, H, and K photometry of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Surveys (UKIDSS) simultaneously, effectively distinguishing celestial objects similar to BDs. The BROWDIE model was trained using UKIDSS data, and based on the model, 118 T dwarfs and 14 Y dwarfs were found in the UKIDSS DR11PLUS LAS L4 zone.</description>

      <title>Towards Hybrid Embedded Feature Selection and Classification Approach with Slim-TSF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional solar flare forecasting approaches have mostly relied on physics-based or data-driven models using solar magnetograms, treating flare predictions as a point-in-time classification problem. This approach has limitations, particularly in capturing the evolving nature of solar activity. Recognizing the limitations of traditional flare forecasting approaches, our research aims to uncover hidden relationships and the evolutionary characteristics of solar flares and their source regions. Our previously proposed Sliding Window Multivariate Time Series Forest (Slim-TSF) has shown the feasibility of usage applied on multivariate time series data. A significant aspect of this study is the comparative analysis of our updated Slim-TSF framework against the original model outcomes. Preliminary findings indicate a notable improvement, with an average increase of 5\% in both the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS). This enhancement not only underscores the effectiveness of our refined methodology but also suggests that our systematic evaluation and feature selection approach can significantly advance the predictive accuracy of solar flare forecasting models.</description>

      <title>cogsworth: A Gala of COSMIC proportions combining binary stellar evolution and galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present cogsworth, an open-source Python tool for producing self-consistent population synthesis and galactic dynamics simulations. With cogsworth one can (1) sample a population of binaries and star formation history, (2) perform rapid (binary) stellar evolution, (3) integrate orbits through the galaxy and (4) inspect the full evolutionary history of each star or compact object, as well as their positions and kinematics. We include the functionality for post-processing hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations as a basis for galactic potentials and star formation histories to better account for initial spatial stellar clustering and more complex potentials. Alternatively, several analytic models are available for both the potential and star formation history. cogsworth can transform the intrinsic simulated population to an observed population through the joint application of dust maps, bolometric correction functions and survey selection functions.
  We provide a detailed explanation of the functionality of cogsworth and demonstrate its capabilities through a series of use cases: (1) We predict the spatial distribution of compact objects and runaways in both dwarf and Milky-Way-like galaxies, (2) using a star cluster from a hydrodynamical simulation, we show how supernovae can change the orbits of stars in several ways, and (3) we predict the separation of disrupted binary stellar companions on the sky and create a synthetic Gaia colour-magnitude diagram. We also discuss some current limitations and plans for future developments. We designed cogsworth and its online documentation to provide a powerful tool for constraining binary evolution, but also a flexible and accessible resource for the entire community.</description>

      <title>DeepTTV: Deep Learning Prediction of Hidden Exoplanet From Transit Timing Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transit timing variation (TTV) provides rich information about the mass and orbital properties of exoplanets, which are often obtained by solving an inverse problem via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we design a new data-driven approach, which potentially can be applied to problems that are hard to traditional MCMC methods, such as the case with only one planet transiting. Specifically, we use a deep learning approach to predict the parameters of non-transit companion for the single transit system with transit information (i.e., TTV, and Transit Duration Variation (TDV)) as input. Thanks to a newly constructed \textit{Transformer}-based architecture that can extract long-range interactions from TTV sequential data, this previously difficult task can now be accomplished with high accuracy, with an overall fractional error of $\sim$2\% on mass and eccentricity.</description>

      <title>GLoW: novel methods for wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-optics phenomena in gravitational lensing occur when the signal's wavelength is commensurate to the gravitational radius of the lens. Although potentially detectable in lensed gravitational waves, fast radio bursts and pulsars, accurate numerical predictions are challenging to compute. Here we present novel methods for wave-optics lensing that allow the treatment of general lenses. In addition to a general algorithm, specialized methods optimize symmetric lenses (arbitrary number of images) and generic lenses in the single-image regime. We also develop approximations for simple lenses (point-like and singular isothermal sphere) that drastically outperform known solutions without compromising accuracy. These algorithms are implemented in Gravitational Lensing of Waves (GLoW): an accurate, flexible, and fast code. GLoW efficiently computes the frequency-dependent amplification factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters in O(1 ms) to O(10 ms) depending on the lens configuration and complexity. GLoW is readily applicable to model lensing diffraction on gravitational-wave signals, offering new means to investigate the distribution of dark-matter and large-scale structure with signals from ground and space detectors.</description>

      <title>Spectral energy distribution of late stage stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a catalog of the energy distribution in the spectra of 263 stars in the wavelength range from 0.4 to 100 {\mu}m, which are at late stages of evolution and have been observed by the ISO space observatory. For each object in the catalog, estimates of the observed bolometric fluxes were derived from smoothed energy distribution curves. The catalog is available at https://infra.sai.msu.ru/sai\_lss\_sed both as a table and in machine-readable format. It is shown that for the specified sample of objects their ISO SWS spectra in the range 2.4-45 {\mu}m only 60% of cases correspond to the general shape of the continuum, and can be used without recalibration. A selection of carbon stars, accessible for the infrared observations from the MSU observatories has been made. For some of them the first brightness estimates in the K, L, and M bands were obtained with the new IR camera of the 2.5-m telescope of CMO.</description>

      <title>Exploring spectropolarimetric inversions using neural fields. Solar chromospheric magnetic field under the weak-field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-Stokes polarimetric datasets, originating from slit-spectrograph or narrow-band filtergrams, are routinely acquired nowadays. The data rate is increasing with the advent of bi-dimensional spectropolarimeters and observing techniques that allow long-time sequences of high-quality observations. There is a clear need to go beyond the traditional pixel-by-pixel strategy in spectropolarimetric inversions by exploiting the spatiotemporal coherence of the inferred physical quantities. We explore the potential of neural networks as a continuous representation of the physical quantities over time and space (also known as neural fields), for spectropolarimetric inversions. We have implemented and tested a neural field to perform the inference of the magnetic field vector (approach also known as physics-informed neural networks) under the weak-field approximation (WFA). By using a neural field to describe the magnetic field vector, we can regularize the solution in the spatial and temporal domain by assuming that the physical quantities are continuous functions of the coordinates. We investigated the results in synthetic and real observations of the Ca II 8542 A line. We also explored the impact of other explicit regularizations, such as using the information of an extrapolated magnetic field, or the orientation of the chromospheric fibrils. Compared to the traditional pixel-by-pixel inversion, the neural field approach improves the fidelity of the reconstruction of the magnetic field vector, especially the transverse component. This implicit regularization is a way of increasing the effective signal-to-noise of the observations. Although it is slower than the pixel-wise WFA estimation, this approach shows a promising potential for depth-stratified inversions, by reducing the number of free parameters and inducing spatio-temporal constraints in the solution.</description>

      <title>Advancing Machine Learning for Stellar Activity and Exoplanet Period Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study applied machine learning models to estimate stellar rotation periods from corrected light curve data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission. Traditional methods often struggle to estimate rotation periods accurately due to noise and variability in the light curve data. The workflow involved using initial period estimates from the LS-Periodogram and Transit Least Squares techniques, followed by splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. We employed several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, and also utilized a Voting Ensemble approach to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
  The analysis included data from multiple Kepler IDs, providing detailed metrics on orbital periods and planet radii. Performance evaluation showed that the Voting Ensemble model yielded the most accurate results, with an RMSE approximately 50\% lower than the Decision Tree model and 17\% better than the K-Nearest Neighbors model. The Random Forest model performed comparably to the Voting Ensemble, indicating high accuracy. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting model exhibited a worse RMSE compared to the other approaches. Comparisons of the predicted rotation periods to the photometric reference periods showed close alignment, suggesting the machine learning models achieved high prediction accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning, particularly ensemble methods, can effectively solve the problem of accurately estimating stellar rotation periods, with significant implications for advancing the study of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Exploring the intermittency of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence by synchrotron polarization radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a critical role in many key astrophysical processes such as star formation, acceleration of cosmic rays, and heat conduction. However, its properties are still poorly understood. We explore how to extract the intermittency of compressible MHD turbulence from the synthetic and real observations. The three statistical methods, namely the probability distribution function, kurtosis, and scaling exponent of the multi-order structure function, are used to reveal the intermittency of MHD turbulence. Our numerical results demonstrate that: (1) the synchrotron polarization intensity statistics can be used to probe the intermittency of magnetic turbulence, by which we can distinguish different turbulence regimes; (2) the intermittency of MHD turbulence is dominated by the slow mode in the sub-Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence regime; (3) the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) at the low latitude region corresponds to the sub-Alfv\'enic and supersonic turbulence regime. We have successfully measured the intermittency of the Galactic ISM from the synthetic and realistic observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NEO Surveyor will detect asteroids and comets using mid-infrared thermal emission, however ground-based followup resources will require knowledge of the expected visible light brightness in order to plan characterization observations. Here we describe the range of visual-to-infrared colors that the NEOs detected by Surveyor will span, and demonstrate that for objects that have no previously reported Visual band observations, estimates of the Johnson Visual-band brightness based on infrared flux alone will have significant uncertainty. Incidental or targeted photometric followup of objects discovered by Surveyor enables predictions of the fraction of reflected light visible and near-infrared wavelengths, supporting additional detailed characterization.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) receivers and technical papers are cited fewer than once in every six publications. This citation shortage is impeding the development of future (sub)millimetre instruments. In an effort to facilitate the correct citations of ALMA receivers and technical papers, this memo provides a comprehensive list of papers for the scientific community. This list was produced in discussion with the scientific and instrumentalist community, based on a June 2024 survey at the European Southern Observatory workshop on the ALMA Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade, as well as with the ALMA technical staff. The authors now encourage the community to enhance their already-excellent ALMA science with the appropriate references to ensure future (sub)millimetre instrumentation can keep addressing the key questions about our Universe.</description>

Abstract: We study a mid-order wavefront sensor (MOWFS) to address fine cophasing errors in exoplanet imaging with future large segmented aperture space telescopes. Observing Earth analogs around Sun-like stars requires contrasts down to $10^{-10}$ in visible light. One promising solution consists of producing a high-contrast dark zone in the image of an observed star. In a space observatory, this dark region will be altered by several effects, and among them, the small misalignments of the telescope mirror segments due to fine thermo-mechanical drifts. To correct for these errors in real time, we investigate a wavefront control loop based on a MOWFS with a Zernike sensor. Such a MOWFS was installed on the high-contrast imager for complex aperture telescopes (HiCAT) testbed in Baltimore in June 2023. The bench uses a 37-segment Iris-AO deformable mirror to mimic telescope segmentation and some wavefront control strategies to produce a dark zone with such an aperture. In this contribution, we first use the MOWFS to characterize the Iris-AO segment discretization steps. For the central segment, we find a minimal step of 125 $\pm$ 31 pm. This result will help us to assess the contribution of the Iris-AO DM on the contrast in HiCAT. We then determine the detection limits of the MOWFS, estimating wavefront error amplitudes of 119 and 102 pm for 10 s and 1 min exposure time with a SNR of 3. These values inform us about the measurement capabilities of our wavefront sensor on the testbed. These preliminary results will be useful to provide insights on metrology and stability for exo-Earth observations with the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Deepest sensitivity to wavelike dark photon dark matter with superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.03183v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wavelike, bosonic dark matter candidates like axions and dark photons can be detected using microwave cavities known as haloscopes. Traditionally, haloscopes consist of tunable copper cavities operating in the TM$_{010}$ mode, but ohmic losses have limited their performance. In contrast, superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities can achieve quality factors of $\sim 10^{10}$, perhaps five orders of magnitude better than copper cavities, leading to more sensitive dark matter detectors. In this paper, we first derive that the scan rate of a haloscope experiment is proportional to the loaded quality factor $Q_L$, even if the cavity bandwidth is much narrower than the dark matter halo line shape. We then present a proof-of-concept search for dark photon dark matter using a nontunable ultrahigh quality SRF cavity. We exclude dark photon dark matter with kinetic mixing strengths of $\chi &gt; 1.5\times 10^{-16}$ for a dark photon mass of $m_{A^{\prime}} = 5.35\mu$eV, achieving the deepest exclusion to wavelike dark photons by almost an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Efficient representations of upper limits and confidence intervals for experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upper limits and confidence intervals are a convenient way to present experimental results. With modern experiments producing more and more data, it is often necessary to reduce the volume of the results for convenient distribution. A common approach is to take a maximum over a set of upper limits, which yields an upper limit valid for the entire set. This, however, can result in significant sensitivity loss, because we discard more constraining data. In this paper we introduce functional upper limits and confidence intervals that allow to summarize results with small relaxation of constraints. A toy example and an application to upper limits in all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches are worked out.</description>

      <title>The \v{d}Alembert solution in hyperboloidal foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the analogue of the \v{d}Alembert solution to the 1+1 wave equation in an hyperboloidal setting. This hyperboloidal \v{d}Alembert solution is used, in turn, to gain intuition into the behaviour of solutions to the wave equation in a hyperboloidal foliation and to explain some apparently anomalous behaviour observed in numerically constructed solutions discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>

Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance can be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with a second-generation TDI null stream $C^{12}_3$. The combined three data streams, including two science observables from the hybrid Relay and $C^{12}_3$, could reduce the instabilities of noise spectra in the targeting frequency band and form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Ensemble noise properties of the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The null hypothesis in Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) analyses includes assumptions about ensemble properties of pulsar time-correlated noise. These properties are encoded in prior probabilities for the amplitude and the spectral index of the power-law power spectral density of temporal correlations of the noise. In this work, we introduce a new procedure for numerical marginalisation over the uncertainties in pulsar noise priors. The procedure may be used in searches for nanohertz gravitational waves and other PTA analyses to resolve prior misspecification at negligible computational cost. Furthermore, we infer the distribution of amplitudes and spectral indices of the power spectral density of spin noise and dispersion measure variation noise based on the observation of 25 millisecond pulsars by the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). Our results may be used for the simulation of realistic noise in PTAs.</description>
