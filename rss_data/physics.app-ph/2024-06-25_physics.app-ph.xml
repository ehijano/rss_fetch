      <title>An ultrasensitive device with embedded phononic crystals for the detection and localisation of nonlinear guided waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a novel approach for the detection and localisation of nonlinear guided waves often associated with the presence of damage in structural components is proposed. The method is active and consists of a piezoelectric transducer bonded to the inspected structure exciting a narrow frequency band wave packet and sensors placed at the proposed ultrasonic devices with embedded phononic crystals. Unit cells of phononic crystals are optimized to open a band gap at the excitation frequency so that the excited waves are attenuated, while the sensitivity detection of higher harmonics is increased.
  The proposed approach is tested numerically and validated experimentally by considering various manufacturing methods, materials, and unit cell geometries. A parametric study of the angle of attachment of the ultrasonic devices with the embedded phononic crystals to the inspected structure is performed. Band gaps and filtering capabilities of several prototypes are tested.
  Numerical simulations of guided wave propagation that include the effect of delamination clapping proved that the proposed designs are sensitive enough to detect higher harmonics by simple signal thresholding. The most promising prototype is tested experimentally showing its capability of detection and localisation of a simulated damage.</description>

      <title>PANDA: A self-driving lab for studying electrodeposited polymer films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the polymer analysis and discovery array (PANDA), an automated system for high-throughput electrodeposition and functional characterization of polymer films. The PANDA is a custom, modular, and low-cost system based on a CNC gantry that we have modified to include a syringe pump, potentiostat, and camera with a telecentric lens. This system can perform fluid handling, electrochemistry, and transmission optical measurements on samples in custom 96-well plates that feature transparent and conducting bottoms. We begin by validating this platform through a series of control fluid handling and electrochemistry experiments to quantify the repeatability, lack of cross-contamination, and accuracy of the system. As a proof-of-concept experimental campaign to study the functional properties of a model polymer film, we optimize the electrochromic switching of electrodeposited poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) films. In particular, we explore the monomer concentration, deposition time, and deposition voltage using an array of experiments selected by Latin hypercube sampling. Subsequently, we run an active learning campaign based upon Bayesian optimization to find the processing conditions that lead to the highest electrochromic switching of PEDOT:PSS. This self-driving lab integrates optical and electrochemical characterization to constitute a novel, automated approach for studying functional polymer films.</description>

      <title>Optical Control of Adaptive Nanoscale Domain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive networks can sense and adjust to dynamic environments to optimize their performance. Understanding their nanoscale responses to external stimuli is essential for applications in nanodevices and neuromorphic computing. However, it is challenging to image such responses on the nanoscale with crystallographic sensitivity. Here, the evolution of nanodomain networks in (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n superlattices was directly visualized in real space as the system adapts to ultrafast repetitive optical excitations that emulate controlled neural inputs. The adaptive response allows the system to explore a wealth of metastable states that were previously inaccessible. Their reconfiguration and competition were quantitatively measured by scanning x-ray nanodiffraction as a function of the number of applied pulses, in which crystallographic characteristics were quantitatively assessed by assorted diffraction patterns using unsupervised machine-learning methods. The corresponding domain boundaries and their connectivity were drastically altered by light, holding promise for light-programmable nanocircuits in analogy to neuroplasticity. Phase-field simulations elucidate that the reconfiguration of the domain networks is a result of the interplay between photocarriers and transient lattice temperature. The demonstrated optical control scheme and the uncovered nanoscopic insights open opportunities for remote control of adaptive nanoscale domain networks.</description>

      <title>Low Excess Noise, High Quantum Efficiency Avalanche Photodiodes for Beyond 2 {\mu}m Wavelength Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, notably CH4 and CO2, has fueled global temperature increases, intensifying concerns regarding the prevailing climate crisis. Effectively monitoring these gases demands a detector spanning the extended short-wavelength infrared (~2.4 {\mu}m) range, covering wavelengths of CH4 (1.65 {\mu}m) and CO2 (2.05 {\mu}m). The state-of-the-art HgCdTe avalanche photodetectors (APDs) offer exceptional performance metrics, including high gain (M) and low excess noise (F). However, their widespread adoption is hindered by inherent challenges such as manufacturability, reproducibility, and cost factors. Moreover, their reliance on cryogenic cooling adds to the cost, size, weight, and power of the system. We have demonstrated a linear mode APD combining an InGaAs/GaAsSb type-II superlattice absorber and an AlGaAsSb multiplier lattice matched to InP substrates. This APD has demonstrated a room temperature M of 178, a maximum measurable external quantum efficiency of 3560 % at 2 {\mu}m, an extremely low excess noise (F &lt; 2 at M &lt; 20), and a small temperature coefficient of breakdown (7.58 mV/K {\mu}m). Such a high performance APD with manufacturable semiconductor materials could lead to a rapid transition to a commercial III-V foundry, holding the promise of revolutionizing high-sensitivity receivers for greenhouse gas monitoring.</description>

      <title>A piezoelectric ski-jump laser beam scanning chip-to-free space photonic link</title>

Abstract: A seamless interface between integrated photonic processors and targets in free-space enables wide-ranging advancements in telescopy, free-space communication, optical ranging, materials processing, biomedical imaging, near eye display, machine optical intelligence and quantum control. An optimal solution allows for 2D scanning from anywhere on a photonic chip over a large number of diffraction limited spots in the far field. Leading approaches rely on scanners where the numerical aperture and actuator size are linked, resulting in a trade off between resolution, speed and footprint, whereas scanning fibers have been limited to bulk optical and mechanical components. Here, we introduce a CMOS fabricated photonic "ski-jump" composed of a broadband, single mode silicon nitride waveguide monolithically integrated atop a piezo-actuated cantilever. The ski-jump passively curl 90 degrees out-of-plane via mechanical meta-stress engineering in a footprint of less than 0.1 mm squared and emit submicron diffraction-limited optical modes with piezoelectric steering. They also exhibit kHz-rate longitudinal and lateral mechanical resonances with displacement ranges exceeding 400 micron and 180 micron, respectively, and quality factors Q&gt;10,000 under vacuum. These resonances enable 2D beam scanning at footprint-adjusted spot-rates of 68.6 Megaspot/s-mm squared surpassing state-of-the-art MEMS mirrors by more than 50. Using these devices, we demonstrate arbitrary 2D image projection and the repeatable initialization and readout of single photons from silicon vacancies in diamond waveguides. Based on current device performance, we identify pathways for achieving &gt;1 Giga-spots in a square cm area to provide a seamless, scalable optical pipeline between integrated photonic processors and the free-space world.</description>

      <title>Perovskite nanocrystal self-assemblies in 3D hollow templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highly ordered nanocrystal (NC) assemblies, namely superlattices (SLs), have been investigated as novel building blocks of optical and optoelectronic devices due to their unique properties based on interactions among neighboring NCs. In particular, lead halide perovskite NC SLs have attracted significant attention, owing to their extraordinary optical characteristics of individual NCs and collective emission processes like superfluorescence (SF). So far, the primary method for preparing perovskite NC SLs has been the drying-mediated self-assembly method, in which the colloidal NCs spontaneously assemble into SLs during solvent evaporation. However, this method lacks controllability because NCs form random-sized SLs at random positions on the substrate rendering NC assemblies in conjunction with device structures such as photonic waveguides or microcavities challenging. Here, we demonstrate template-assisted self-assembly to deterministically place perovskite NC SLs and control their geometrical properties. A solution of CsPbBr3 NCs is drop-casted on a substrate with lithographically-defined hollow structures. After solvent evaporation and removal of excess NCs from the substrate surface, NCs only remain in the templates thereby defining the position and size of these NC assemblies. We performed photoluminescence (PL) measurements on these NC assemblies and observed signatures of SF, similar as in spontaneously assembled SLs. Our findings are crucial for optical devices that harness embedded perovskite NC assemblies and prepare fundamental studies on how these collective effects can be tailored through the SL geometry.</description>

      <title>Graphene oxide two dimensional films for thermo-optic photonic integrated devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient heat management and control in optical devices, facilitated by advanced thermo-optic materials, is critical for many applications such as photovoltaics, thermal emitters, mode-locked lasers, and optical switches. Here, we investigate the thermo-optic properties of 2D graphene oxide (GO) films by precisely integrating them onto microring resonators (MRRs) with control over the film thicknesses and lengths. We characterize the refractive index, extinction coefficient, thermo-optic coefficient, and thermal conductivity of for the GO films with different layer numbers and degrees of reduction, including reversible reduction and enhanced optical bistability induced by photo-thermal effects. Experimental results show that the thermo-optic properties of 2D GO films vary widely with the degree of reduction, with significant polarization anisotropy, enabling efficient polarization sensitive devices. The versatile thermo-optic response of 2D GO substantially expands the scope of functionalities and devices that can be engineered, making it promising for a diverse range of thermo-optic applications.</description>

      <title>Depth-Resolved Characterization of Centrifugal Disk Finishing of Additively Manufactured Inconel 718</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface characteristics are a major contributor to the in-service performance, particularly fatigue life, of additively manufactured (AM) components. Centrifugal disk finishing (CDF) is one of many rigid media, abrasive machining processes employed to smooth the surfaces and edges of AM components. Within the general family of abrasive machining processes currently applied to AM, CDF is moderate in terms of material removal rate and the inertial forces exerted. How CDF alters the underlying microstructure of the processed surface is currently unknown. Here we employ white light profilometry and high-energy X-ray diffraction to characterize surface finish, crystallographic texture, and anisotropic distributions of residual microscale strain as a function of depth in CDF-finished Inconel 718 manufactured with laser powder bed fusion. Surfaces are finished using both unimodal and bimodal finishing media size distributions. We find that CDF will remove surface crystallographic textures (here a {111} fiber texture) from AM components, but generally not alter the bulk texture (here a cube texture). CDF is also found to impart significant amounts of residual microscale strain into the first 100 $\mu$m from the sample surface as evidenced by an approximately 50% increase in diffraction peak widths at 20 $\mu$m from the surface in comparison to 120 $\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>

      <title>Structural and Electrical Properties of Grafted Si/GaAsSb Heterojunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength, especially 1.55 um, has attracted significant attention in various areas such as high-speed optical communication and LiDAR systems. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are a critical component as a receiver in these systems due to their internal gain which enhances the system performance. Silicon-based APDs are promising since they are CMOS compatible, but they are limited in detecting 1.55 um light detection. This study proposes a p-type Si on n-type GaAs0.51Sb0.49 (GaAsSb) lattice matched to InP substrates heterojunction formed using a grafting technique for future GaAsSb/Si APD technology. A p+Si nanomembrane is transferred onto the GaAsSb/AlInAs/InP substrate, with an ultrathin ALD-Al2O3 oxide at the interface, which behaves as both double-side passivation and quantum tunneling layers. The devices exhibit excellent surface morphology and interface quality, confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Also, the current-voltage (I-V) of the p+Si/n-GaAsSb heterojunction shows ideal rectifying characteristics with an ideality factor of 1.15. The I-V tests across multiple devices confirm high consistency and yield. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement reveals that GaAsSb and Si are found to have type-II band alignment with a conduction band offset of 50 meV which is favorable for the high-bandwidth APD application. The demonstration of the GaAsSb/Si heterojunction highlights the potential to advance current SWIR PD technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial review focuses on the basic theoretical backgrounds, their working principles, and implementation of impedance spectroscopy in both electroceramics and electrochemical research and technological applications. Various contributions to the impedance, admittance, dielectric, and conductivity characteristics of electroceramic materials can be disentangled and independently characterized with the help of impedance spectroscopy as a function of frequency and temperature. In polycrystalline materials, the impedance, charge transport/ conduction mechanism, and the macroscopic dielectric properties i.e., dielectric constant and loss are typically composed of many contributions, including the bulk or grain resistance/capacitance, grain boundary, and sample-electrode interface effect. Similarly, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) endeavors to the charging kinetics, diffusion, and mechanical impact of various electrochemical systems widely used in energy storage (i.e., supercapacitor, battery), corrosion resistance, chemical and bio-sensing, diagnostics, etc. in electrolytes as a function of frequency. The understanding of various contributions in the EIS spectra i.e., kinetic control, mass control, and diffusion control is essential for their practical implications. It is demonstrated that electrochemical and electroceramics impedance spectroscopy is an effective method to explain and simulate such behavior. Deconvolute these contributions to obtain a detailed understanding of the functionality of polycrystalline electroceramic materials. This short review aims to endow the expertise of senior researchers in many fields where both EIS (electrochemical and ceramics) are involved, as well as to provide the necessary background information for junior researchers working in these fields.</description>

      <title>Probing Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state via quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent attention has been drawn to temperature gradient generated $\Delta_T$ noise at vanishing charge current. This study delves into examining the properties of spin-polarised $\Delta T$ noise in conjunction with $\Delta_T$-shot noise, $\Delta_T$-thermal noise, and quantum noise (again both shot and thermal noise) in a one-dimensional (1D) structure comprising metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction to probe Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states. YSR bound states, which are localized states within the superconducting gap of a superconductor are induced by a magnetic impurity acting as a spin-flipper. A YSR bound state should be distinguished from a Majorana bound state (MBS), which too can occur due to interaction with magnetic impurities, e.g., magnetic adatoms on superconductors, and this can lead to false positives in detecting MBS. Clarifying this by providing a unique signature for the YSR-bound state is the main aim of this work. In this paper, we show that YSR bound states can be effectively probed using quantum noise and the recently discovered $\Delta_T$ noise, with a focus on especially spin transport. We see that the spin $\Delta_T$ noise is a superior tool compared to the charge $\Delta_T$ noise as a probe for YSR bound states. Additionally, our analysis of quantum noise reveals that similar to $\Delta_T$ noise, spin quantum noise is more effective than charge quantum noise in detecting YSR bound states.</description>
