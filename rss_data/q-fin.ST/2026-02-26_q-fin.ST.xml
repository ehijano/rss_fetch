      <title>A Bayesian approach to out-of-sample network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks underpin systems that range from finance to biology, yet their structure is often only partially observed. Current reconstruction methods typically fit the parameters of a model anew to each snapshot, thus offering no guidance to predict future configurations. Here, we develop a Bayesian approach that uses the information about past network snapshots to inform a prior and predict the subsequent ones, while quantifying uncertainty. Instantiated with a single-parameter fitness model, our method infers link probabilities from node strengths and carries information forward in time. When applied to the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposit across the years 1999-2012, our method accurately recovers the number of connections per bank at subsequent times, outperforming probabilistic benchmarks designed for analogous, link prediction tasks. Notably, each predicted snapshot serves as a reliable prior for the next one, thus enabling self-sustained, out-of-sample reconstruction of evolving networks with a minimal amount of additional data.</description>

      <title>When Fusion Helps and When It Breaks: View-Aligned Robustness in Same-Source Financial Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study same-source multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day direction prediction using two deterministic, window-aligned image views derived from the same time series: an OHLCV-rendered chart (ohlcv) and a technical-indicator matrix (indic). To control label ambiguity from near-zero moves, we use an ex-post minimum-movement threshold min_move (tau) based on realized absolute next-day return, defining an offline benchmark on the subset where the absolute next-day return is at least tau. Under leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo, we compare early fusion (channel stacking) and dual-encoder late fusion with optional cross-branch consistency. We then evaluate pixel-space L-infinity evasion attacks (FGSM/PGD) under view-constrained and joint threat models. We find that fusion is regime dependent: early fusion can suffer negative transfer under noisier settings, whereas late fusion is a more reliable default once labels stabilize. Robustness degrades sharply under tiny budgets with stable view-dependent vulnerabilities; late fusion often helps under view-constrained attacks, but joint perturbations remain challenging.</description>
