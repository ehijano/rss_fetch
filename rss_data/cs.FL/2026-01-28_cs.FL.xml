      <title>Etude des morphismes pr{\'e}servant les mots primitifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a reminder of some properties of primitive words and the morphisms that preserve them. Their proofs, which I have more or less revised, are included. This makes the article almost self-contained. I also contribute by giving some properties of primitive words, but especially by showing that a morphism without powers k($\ge$ 5) is primitive and that a uniform morphism without powers k($\ge$ 2) is primitive.</description>

      <title>The complexity of downward closures of indexed languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indexed languages are a classical notion in formal language theory, which has attracted attention in recent decades due to its role in higher-order model checking: They are precisely the languages accepted by order-2 pushdown automata. The downward closure of an indexed language -- the set of all (scattered) subwords of its members -- is well-known to be a regular over-approximation. It was shown by Zetzsche (ICALP 2015) that the downward closure of a given indexed language is effectively computable. However, the algorithm comes with no complexity bounds, and it has remained open whether a primitive-recursive construction exists. We settle this question and provide a triply (resp.\ quadruply) exponential construction of a non-deterministic (resp.\ deterministic) automaton. We also prove (asymptotically) matching lower bounds. For the upper bounds, we rely on recent advances in semigroup theory, which let us compute bounded-size summaries of words with respect to a finite semigroup. By replacing stacks with their summaries, we are able to transform an indexed grammar into a context-free one with the same downward closure, and then apply existing bounds for context-free grammars.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebras of series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a large family of product operations of formal power series in noncommuting indeterminates, the classes of automata they define, and the respective equivalence problems. A $P$-product of series is defined coinductively by a polynomial product rule $P$, which gives a recursive recipe to build the product of two series as a function of the series themselves and their derivatives. The first main result of the paper is a complete and decidable characterisation of all product rules $P$ giving rise to $P$-products which are bilinear, associative, and commutative. The characterisation shows that there are infinitely many such products, and in particular it applies to the notable Hadamard, shuffle, and infiltration products from the literature. Every $P$-product gives rise to the class of $P$-automata, an infinite-state model where states are terms. The second main result of the paper is that the equivalence problem for $P$-automata is decidable for $P$-products satisfying our characterisation. This explains, subsumes, and extends known results from the literature on the Hadamard, shuffle, and infiltration automata. We have formalised most results in the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>On the Expressiveness of State Space Models via Temporal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of state space models (SSM), which have recently emerged as a potential alternative to transformer architectures in large language models. Building on recent work, we analyse SSM expressiveness through fragments and extensions of linear temporal logic over finite traces. Our results show that the expressive capabilities of SSM vary substantially depending on the underlying gating mechanism. We further distinguish between SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic (quantised models), whose expressive power remains within regular languages, and SSM with unbounded precision, which can capture counting properties and non-regular languages. In addition, we provide a systematic comparison between these different SSM variants and known results on transformers, thereby clarifying how the two architectures relate in terms of expressive power.</description>

      <title>Weighted Tree Automata -- May it be a little more?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a book on weighted tree automata. We present the basic definitions and some of the important results in a coherent form with full proofs. The concept of weighted tree automata is part of Automata Theory and it touches the area of Universal Algebra. It originated from two sources: weighted string automata and finite-state tree automata.</description>

      <title>Algebraic power series and their automatic complexity modulo prime powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Christol and, independently, Denef and Lipshitz showed that an algebraic sequence of $p$-adic integers (or integers) is $p$-automatic when reduced modulo $p^\alpha$. Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton size for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\alpha$. Under mild conditions, we improve this bound to the order of $p^{\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and degree of the minimal annihilating polynomial modulo $p$. We achieve this bound by showing that all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration system. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our approach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also obtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.</description>
