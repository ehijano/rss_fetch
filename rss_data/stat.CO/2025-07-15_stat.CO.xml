      <title>Sampling-Based Estimation of Jaccard Containment and Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the containment and similarity between two sets using only random samples from each set, without relying on sketches or full data access. The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</description>

      <title>Frank-Wolfe Recursions for the Emergency Response Problem on Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimization problem over measures for emergency response to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), where the goal is to allocate volunteer resources across a spatial region to minimize the probability of death. The problem is infinite-dimensional and poses challenges for analysis and computation. We first establish structural properties, including convexity of the objective functional, compactness of the feasible set, and existence of optimal solutions. We also derive the influence function, which serves as the first-order variational object in our optimization framework. We then adapt and analyze a fully-corrective Frank-Wolfe (fc-FW) algorithm that operates directly on the infinite-dimensional problem without discretization or parametric approximation. We show a form of convergence even when subproblems are not solved to global optimality. Our full implementation of fc-FW demonstrates complex solution structure even in simple discrete cases, reveals nontrivial volunteer allocations in continuous cases, and scales to realistic urban scenarios using OHCA data from the city of Auckland, New Zealand. Finally, we show that when volunteer travel is modeled through the $L_1$ norm, the influence function is piecewise strictly concave, enabling fast computation via support reduction. The proposed framework and analysis extend naturally to a broad class of $P$-means problems.</description>

      <title>MF-GLaM: A multifidelity stochastic emulator using generalized lambda models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic simulators exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to unobservable, uncontrollable, or unmodeled input variables, resulting in random outputs even at fixed input conditions. Such simulators are common across various scientific disciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability distribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic surrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately characterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large datasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF) simulators. When lower-fidelity (LF) stochastic simulators are available, they can enhance limited HF information within a multifidelity surrogate modeling (MFSM) framework. While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic settings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional response distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to efficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic simulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach builds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the conditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter generalized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no access to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple replications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM through synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake application. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the same cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly reduced cost.</description>

      <title>Flexible Modeling of Multivariate Skewed and Heavy-Tailed Data via a Non-Central Skew t Distribution: Application to Tumor Shape Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a flexible formulation of the multivariate non-central skew t (NCST) distribution, defined by scaling skew-normal random vectors with independent chi-squared variables. This construction extends the classical multivariate t family by allowing both asymmetry and non-centrality, which provides an alternative to existing skew t models that often rely on restrictive assumptions for tractability. We derive key theoretical properties of the NCST distribution, which includes its moment structure, affine transformation behavior, and the distribution of quadratic forms. Due to the lack of a closed-form density, we implement a Monte Carlo likelihood approximation to enable maximum likelihood estimation and evaluate its performance through simulation studies. To demonstrate practical utility, we apply the NCST model to breast cancer diagnostic data, modeling multiple features of tumor shape. The NCST model achieves a superior fit based on information criteria and visual diagnostics, particularly in the presence of skewness and heavy tails compared to standard alternatives, including the multivariate normal, skew normal, and Azzalini's skew $t$ distribution. Our findings suggest that the NCST distribution offers a useful and interpretable choice for modeling complex multivariate data, which highlights promising directions for future development in likelihood inference, Bayesian computation, and applications involving asymmetry and non-Gaussian dependence.</description>

      <title>MGA-Net: A Novel Mask-Guided Attention Neural Network for Precision Neonatal Brain Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse and independent datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.Our code is available at https://github.com/BahramJafrasteh/MGA-Net</description>

      <title>LITE: Efficiently Estimating Gaussian Probability of Maximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the probability of maximality (PoM) of a Gaussian random vector, i.e., the probability for each dimension to be maximal. This is a key challenge in applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to reinforcement learning, where the PoM not only helps with finding an optimal action, but yields a fine-grained analysis of the action domain, crucial in tasks such as drug discovery. Existing techniques are costly, scaling polynomially in computation and memory with the vector size. We introduce LITE, the first approach for estimating Gaussian PoM with almost-linear time and memory complexity. LITE achieves SOTA accuracy on a number of tasks, while being in practice several orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. This also translates to a better performance on downstream tasks such as entropy estimation and optimal control of bandits. Theoretically, we cast LITE as entropy-regularized UCB and connect it to prior PoM estimators.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Smoothing of Directional and Axial Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss generalized linear models for directional data where the conditional distribution of the response is a von Mises-Fisher distribution in arbitrary dimension or a Bingham distribution on the unit circle. To do this properly, we parametrize von Mises-Fisher distributions by Euclidean parameters and investigate computational aspects of this parametrization. Then we modify this approach for local polynomial regression as a means of nonparametric smoothing of distributional data. The methods are illustrated with simulated data and a data set from planetary sciences involving covariate vectors on a sphere with axial response.</description>

      <title>Scalable Signed Exponential Random Graph Models under Local Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional network analysis focuses on binary edges, while real-world relationships are more nuanced, encompassing cooperation, neutrality, and conflict. The rise of negative edges in social media discussions spurred interest in analyzing signed interactions, especially in polarized debates. However, the vast data generated by digital networks presents challenges for traditional methods like Stochastic Block Models (SBM) and Exponential Family Random Graph Models (ERGM), particularly due to the homogeneity assumption and global dependence, which become increasingly unrealistic as network size grows. To address this, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of SBM and ERGM while mitigating their weaknesses by incorporating local dependence based on non-overlapping blocks. Our approach involves a two-step process: first, decomposing the network into sub-networks using SBM approximation, and then estimating parameters using ERGM methods. We validate our method on large synthetic networks and apply it to a signed Wikipedia network of thousands of editors. Through the use of local dependence, we find patterns consistent with structural balance theory.</description>
