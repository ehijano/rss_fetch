      <title>Viewpoint: On the Emergence of van der Waals Magnets: A Personal Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of magnetism in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (FePS$_3$, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$) in 2016 marked an important moment in the development of two-dimensional (2D) physics. In this personal reflection, I describe how a simple question, posed in the early 2010s, motivated experimental efforts that culminated in the demonstration of antiferromagnetic order in monolayer FePS$_3$. Alongside subsequent reports of vdW ferromagnets in 2017, these developments helped establish intrinsic magnetism as a viable degree of freedom in atomically thin materials. I close with personal lessons drawn from this period and a perspective on the opportunities that now shape the field's second decade and beyond.</description>

      <title>Astronomy in the Islamic World: a European Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical and astronomical achievements of the Islamic World during its golden era are briefly exposed. Thie article is based on the invited talk delivered remotely at the ICRANet-Isfahan Astronomical meeting, November 2-5, 2021, which, in turn, reproduces major parts of one of the chapters of my book ``Our Celestial Clockwork'', published recently (2021) by the World Scientific.</description>

      <title>Gatekeeping: a Partial History of Cold Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most public episodes of gatekeeping in modern science was the case of so-called 'cold fusion'. At a news conference in 1989 the electrochemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced that they had found evidence of nuclear fusion in palladium electrodes loaded with deuterium. There was worldwide interest. Many groups sought to reproduce the results, most unsuccessfully. Within months, the prevailing view became strongly negative. The claims of Fleischmann and Pons came to be regarded as disreputable, as well as false. As the Caltech physicist David Goldstein put it, cold fusion became 'a pariah field, cast out by the scientific establishment' (Goldstein 1994). The case would already be interesting for students of gatekeeping if the story had ended at that point. Even more interestingly, however, the field survived and persisted. It has been enjoying a modest renaissance, with recent government funding both in the US and the EU. This piece offers an opinionated introduction to cold fusion as a case study of scientific gatekeeping, discussing both its early and recent history</description>
