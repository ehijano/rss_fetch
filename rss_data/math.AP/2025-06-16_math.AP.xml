      <title>Poisson-type problems with transmission conditions at boundaries of infinite metric trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Poisson-type problem on a mixed-dimensional structure combining a Euclidean domain and a lower-dimensional self-similar component touching a compact surface (interface). The lower-dimensional piece is a so-called infinite metric tree (one-dimensional branching structure), and the key ingredient of the study is a rigorous definition of the gluing conditions between the two components. These constructions are based on the recent concept of embedded trace maps and some abstract machineries derived from a suitable Green-type formula. The problem is then reduced to the study of Fredholm properties of a linear combination of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for the tree and the Euclidean domain, which yields desired existence and uniqueness results. One also shows that finite sections of tree can be used for an efficient approximation of the solutions.</description>

      <title>A detailed and comprehensive account of fractional Physics-Informed Neural Networks: From implementation to efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional differential equations are powerful mathematical descriptors for intricate physical phenomena in a compact form. However, compared to integer ordinary or partial differential equations, solving fractional differential equations can be challenging considering the intricate details involved in their numerical solutions. Robust data-driven solutions hence can be of great interest for solving fractional differential equations. In the recent years, fractional physics-informed neural network has appeared as a platform for solving fractional differential equations and till now, efforts have been made to improve its performance. In this work, we present a fully detailed interrogation of fractional physics-informed neural networks with different foundations to solve different categories of fractional differential equations: fractional ordinary differntial equation, as well as two and three dimensional fractional partial differential equations. These equations are solved employing two numerical methods based on the Caputo formalism. We show that these platforms are generally able to accurately solve the equations with minor discrepancies at initial times. Nonetheless, since in Caputo formalism, the value of a fractional derivative at each point requires the function's value in all of its previous history, it is computationally burdensome. Here, we discuss strategies to improve accuracy of fractional physics-informed neural networks solutions without imposing heavy computational costs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of the fundamental solution of space-time fractional equations with a reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a space-time fractional partial differential equation with a reactive term. We describe the speed of invasion of its fundamental solution, extending recent results in this topic, which had been proved for the one dimensional spatial setting and some fractional parameters involved in the equation. The key tool to achieve these results in a wide range of cases (any spatial dimension, any time and spatial fractional differential parameters, and any polynomial speed of invasion) is the subordination.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics and Scattering for Critically Weakly Hyperbolic and Singular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a very general class of first-order linear hyperbolic systems that both become weakly hyperbolic and contain lower-order coefficients that blow up at a single time $t = 0$. In "critical" weakly hyperbolic settings, it is well-known that solutions lose a finite amount of regularity at the degenerate time $t = 0$. In this paper, we both improve upon the results in the weakly hyperbolic setting, and we extend this analysis to systems containing critically singular coefficients, which may also exhibit significantly modified asymptotics at $t = 0$.
  In particular, we give precise quantifications for (1) the asymptotics of solutions as $t$ approaches $0$; (2) the scattering problem of solving the system with asymptotic data at $t = 0$; and (3) the loss of regularity due to the degeneracies at $t = 0$. Finally, we discuss a variety of applications for these results, including to weakly hyperbolic and singular wave equations, equations of higher order, and equations arising from relativity and cosmology, e.g. at big bang singularities.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Simulation of Plasmons in Graphene with Time- and Space-dependent Drude Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of plasmons on graphene. The problem is considered in two dimensions with a transverse magnetic (TM) electromagnetic field. The graphene material is assumed to be flat and is modeled as a conductive sheet. This leads to a jump condition for the magnetic field on the sheet where it is related to the current density on the sheet. The current density itself satisfies Drude's law. The model then consists of Maxwell's equations coupled to current density on the sheet. To make the problem more computationally approachable, we develop a time-dependent integro-differential equation for the current density. This effectively reduces the problem to one space dimension. A finite difference method is proposed to solve the resulting equation. Numerical examples are given to illustrate previously unreported behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we concern ourselves with the evolution of a droplet of an ideal fluid in two dimensions, which has nontrivial bulk vorticity and is only subject to the effects of surface tension. We construct initial data with initial domain being a disk and initial velocity being arbitrarily small, such that the vorticity Hessian grows exponentially infinitely in time.</description>

      <title>Doubly nonlinear parabolic equation with perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the initial boundary value problem of a doubly nonlinear parabolic equation with nonlinear perturbation. We impose the homogeneous Dirichlet condition on this problem. We aim to reduce the growth condition of the nonlinear term and the largeness of exponent as possible so that we can apply our result to both singular and degenerate type parabolic equations. We use in our proof the $L ^{\infty }$-estimate of the time-discrete equation derived in the previous work and apply the so-called $L ^{\infty }$-energy method to the time-discrete problem. We also discuss the uniqueness of solution by using the previous result.</description>

      <title>Source Identification Problem for a Nonlinear Subdiffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work is devoted to the study of the inverse problem of determining the right-hand side of a nonlinear subdiffusion equation with a Caputo derivative with respect to time. Nonlinearity of the equation means that the right-hand side of the equation depends nonlinearly on the solution of the equation. The inverse problem consists of reconstructing the coefficient of the right-hand side, which depends on both time and spatial variables, under a measurement in an integral form. Similar inverse problems were previously studied in the case when the right-hand side depends only on time or on a spatial variable. A weak solution is sought by the Galerkin method. A priori estimates are proved, and with their help, the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the inverse problem under consideration are established. It is noteworthy that the results obtained are new for diffusion equations as well.</description>

      <title>On scattering for NLS: rigidity properties and numerical simulations via the lens transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the scattering operator associated with the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation which captures the evolution of solutions over an infinite time-interval under the nonlinear flow of this equation. The asymptotic nature of the scattering operator (involving unbounded time) makes its computation particularly challenging. We overcome this by exploiting the space-time compactification provided by the lens transform, marking the first use of this technique in numerical simulations. This results in a highly efficient and reliable methodology for computing the scattering operator in various regimes. In developing this approach we introduce and prove several new identities and theoretical properties of the scattering operator. We support our construction with several numerical experiments which we show to agree with known analytical properties of the scattering operator, and also address the case of long-range scattering for the one-dimensional cubic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Our simulations permit us to further explore regimes beyond current analytical understanding, and lead us to formulate new conjectures concerning fixed and rotating points of the operator, as well as its existence in the long-range setting for both defocusing and focusing cases.</description>

Abstract: We prove that instantaneous gelation (i.e., instantaneous loss of mass) occurs for coagulation equations with sum-type kernels of homogeneity greater than one which vanish on the diagonal. Our proof includes solutions that are Radon measures if we exclude the case of initial data that are a single Dirac delta.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic large time behavior of singular solutions of the fast diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\ge 3$, $0&lt;m&lt;\frac{n-2}{n}$, $\alpha=\frac{2\beta-1}{1-m}$ and $\frac{2}{1-m}&lt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;\frac{n-2}{m}$. We give a new direct proof using fixed point method on the existence of singular radially symmetric forward self-similar solution of the form $V(x,t)=t^{-\alpha} f(t^{-\beta}x)$ $\forall x\in\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, $t&gt;0$, for the fast diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta (u^m/m)$ in $(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\})\times (0,\infty)$, where $f$ satisfies \begin{equation*} \Delta (f^m/m) + \alpha f + \beta x \cdot \nabla f =0 \quad \text{in} \; \mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\} \end{equation*} with $\lim_{|x| \to 0} |x|^{ \frac{\alpha}{\beta}}f(x)=A$ and $\lim_{|x| \to \infty}f(x) = D_A$ for some constants $A&gt;0$, $D_A &gt; 0$. We also obtain an asymptotic expansion of such singular radially symmetric solution $f$ near the origin. We will also prove the asymptotic large time behaviour of the singular solutions of the fast diffusion equation $u_t= \Delta (u^m/m)$ in $(\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\})\times (0,\infty)$, $u(x,0)=u_0(x)$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, satisfying the condition $A_1|x|^{-\gamma}\leq u_0(x)\leq A_2|x|^{-\gamma}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$, for some constants $A_2&gt;A_1&gt;0$ and $n\le\gamma&lt;\frac{n-2}{m}$.</description>

      <title>Gradient regularity for widely degenerate elliptic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the regularity of weak solutions $u\colon\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ to elliptic equations of the type \begin{equation*}
  \mathrm{div}\, \nabla \mathcal{F}(x,Du) = f\qquad\text{in $\Omega$}, \end{equation*} whose ellipticity degenerates in a fixed bounded and convex set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ with $0\in \mathrm{Int}\, E$. Here, $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ denotes a bounded domain, and $\mathcal{F} \colon \Omega\times\mathbb{R}^n \to\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is a function with the properties: for any $x\in\Omega$, the mapping $\xi\mapsto \mathcal{F}(x,\xi)$ is regular outside $E$ and vanishes entirely within this set. Additionally, we assume $f\in L^{n+\sigma}(\Omega)$ for some $\sigma &gt; 0$, representing an arbitrary datum. Our main result establishes the regularity
  \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{K}(Du)\in C^0(\Omega)
  \end{equation*} for any continuous function $\mathcal{K}\in C^0(\mathbb{R}^n)$ vanishing on $E$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the connection between the chemotaxis--Navier--Stokes system with porous medium type nonlinear diffusion and the Hele--Shaw problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq2$). First, we prove the global-in-time existence of weak solutions for the Cauchy problem of the chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system with the general initial data, uniformly in the diffusion range $m\in [3,\infty)$. Then, we rigorously justify the Hele--Shaw limit for this system as $m\rightarrow\infty$, showing the convergence to a free boundary problem of Hele--Shaw type, where the bacterium (cell) diffusion is governed by the stiff pressure law. Moreover, the complementarity relation characterizing the limiting bacterium (cell) pressure via a degenerate elliptic equation is verified by a novel application of the Hele--Shaw framework.</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse scattering for an isotropic medium with a second-order boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the direct and inverse scattering problem for a penetrable, isotropic obstacle with a second-order Robin boundary condition which asymptotically models the delamination of boundary of the scatterer. We develop a direct sampling method to solve the inverse shape problem by numerically recovering the scatterer. Here we assume that the corresponding Cauchy data is measured on the boundary of a region which fully contains the scatterer. Similar methods have been applied to other inverse shape problems, but they have not been studied for a penetrable, isotropic scatterer with a second-order Robin boundary condition. We also initiate the study of the corresponding transmission eigenvalue problem, which is derived from assuming zero Cauchy data is measured on the boundary of the region which fully contains the scatterer. We prove that the transmission eigenvalues for this problem are at most a discrete set. Numerical examples will be presented for the inverse shape problem and transmission eigenvalue problem in two dimensions for circular and non-circular scatterers.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many solutions for nonlinear superposition operators of mixed fractional order involving critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses elliptic problems involving the superposition of nonlinear fractional operators with the critical Sobolev exponent in sublinear regimes. We establish the existence of infinitely many nontrivial weak solutions using a variational framework that combines a truncation argument with the notion of genus. A central part of our analysis is the verification of the Palais--Smale $(\mathrm{PS})_c$ condition for every $q \in (1, p_{s_\sharp}^*)$, despite the challenges posed by the lack of compactness due to the critical exponent.
  On the one hand, our approach extends and generalizes earlier results by Garc{\'i}a Azorero and Peral Alonso \emph{[Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 1991]} and by Da Silva, Fiscella, and Viloria \emph{[J. Differential Equations, 2024]}; on the other hand, the results obtained here complement the study of the Brezis--Nirenberg-type problem by Dipierro, Perera, Sportelli, and Valdinoci \emph{[Commun. Contemp. Math., 2024]} for $q = p$ and by Aikyn, Ghosh, Kumar, and Ruzhansky \emph{[arXiv:2504.05105, 2025]} for $p &lt; q &lt; p_{s_\sharp}^*$. Notably, our results are new even in the classical case $p = 2$, highlighting the broader applicability of the methods developed here.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games without Rational Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean Field Game (MFG) models implicitly assume "rational expectations", meaning that the heterogeneous agents being modeled correctly know all relevant transition probabilities for the complex system they inhabit. When there is common noise, this assumption results in the "Master equation" (a.k.a. "Monster equation"), a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in which the infinite-dimensional density of agents is a state variable. The rational expectations assumption and the implication that agents solve Master equations is unrealistic in many applications. We show how to instead formulate MFGs with non-rational expectations. Departing from rational expectations is particularly relevant in "MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling", i.e. MFGs in which agents' running reward function depends on the density only through low-dimensional functionals of this density. This happens, for example, in most macroeconomics MFGs in which these low-dimensional functionals have the interpretation of "equilibrium prices." In MFGs with a low-dimensional coupling, departing from rational expectations allows for completely sidestepping the Master equation and for instead solving much simpler finite-dimensional HJB equations. We introduce an adaptive learning model as a particular example of non-rational expectations and discuss its properties.</description>

      <title>A "trembling hand perfect" equilibrium for a certain class of mean field games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a particular class of mean field games whose solutions can be formally connected to a scalar transport equation on the Wasserstein space of measures. For this class, we construct some interesting explicit examples of non-uniqueness of Nash equilibria. We then address the selection problem of finding rational criteria by which to choose one equilibrium over others. We show that when the theory of entropy solutions is used, we can obtain explicit error estimates for the ``vanishing noise limit,'' where the error is measured in a certain norm that measures the distance between two functions over the set of empirical measures.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace norms for Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural $H^1(\Omega)$ energy norm for Helmholtz problems is weighted with the wavenumber modulus $\sigma$ and induces natural weighted norms on the trace spaces $H^{\pm1/2}(\Gamma)$ by minimial extension to $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$. This paper presents a rigorous analysis for these trace norms with an explicit characterisation by weighted Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms and scaling estimates, highlighting their dependence on the geometry of the extension set $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$ and the weight $\sigma$. The analysis identifies conditions under which these trace norms are intrinsic to the isolated boundary component $\Gamma\subset\partial\Omega$ and provides $\sigma$-explicit estimates for trace inequalities in weighted spaces. In these natural wavenumber-weighted norms, the boundary integral operators allow improved continuity estimates that do \emph{not} deterioriate as $\sigma\to 0$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimizers $\boldsymbol{m}\colon \mathbb R^2\to\mathbb S^2$ of the energy functional \begin{align*} E_\sigma(\boldsymbol{m}) = \int_{\mathbb R^2} \bigg(\frac 12 |\nabla\boldsymbol{m}|^2 +\sigma^2 \boldsymbol{ m} \cdot \nabla \times\boldsymbol{m} +\sigma^2 m_3^2
  \bigg)\, dx\,, \end{align*} for $0&lt;\sigma\ll 1$, with prescribed topological degree \begin{align*} Q(\boldsymbol{m})=\frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\mathbb R^2}\boldsymbol{m} \cdot \partial_1 \boldsymbol{m}\times\partial_2\boldsymbol{m}\, dx =\pm 1\,. \end{align*} This model arises in thin ferromagnetic films with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and easy-plane anisotropy, where these minimizers represent bimeron configurations. We prove their existence, and describe them precisely as perturbations of specific M\"obius maps: we establish in particular that they are localized at scale of order $1/|\ln(\sigma^2)|$. The proof follows a strategy introduced by Bernand-Mantel, Muratov and Simon (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2021) for a similar model with easy-axis anisotropy, but requires several adaptations to deal with the less coercive easy-plane anisotropy and different symmetry properties.</description>

      <title>(CMC) 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constant Mean Curvature (CMC) 1-immersions of surfaces into hyperbolic 3-manifolds are natural and yet rather curious objects in hyperbolic geometry with interesting applications.
  Firstly, Bryant revealed surprising relations between (CMC) $1$-immersions of surfaces into $\mathbb H^3$ (Bryant surfaces) and (cousins) minimal immersions into $\mathbb E^3.$ In addition, the interest to (CMC) immersions of a surface $S$ (closed, orientable, with genus $\mathfrak{g} \geq2$) into hyperbolic 3-manifolds was motivated by Uhlenbeck in connection to irreducible representations of the fundamental group $\pi_{1}(S)$ into $PSL(2,\mathbb{C}).$ However a (CMC) 1-immersed compact surface is likely to develop singularities (punctures at finitely many points), and indeed in our analysis the prescribed value 1 of the mean curvature enters as a "critical" parameter.
  In fact, Huang-Lucia-Tarantello showed that (CMC) $c$-immersions of $S$ into hyperbolic 3-manifolds exist for $|c | &lt;1$ and are parametrized by elements of the tangent bundle of the Teichmueller space of $S.$ More importantly, (CMC) $1$-immersions are attained only as "limits" for $|c| \to 1^-$ . In general the passage to the limit can be prevented by possible blow-up phenomena captured in terms of the Kodaira map and its suitable extension respectively for genus $\mathfrak{g}=2$ and $\mathfrak{g}=3.$ Here we handle the case of surfaces of any genus. In Theorem , we are able to encompass the blow up situation in terms of an appropriate "orthogonality" condition. Subsequently, we can provide the existence and uniqueness of (CMC) 1-immersions under an appropriate "generic" condition, see Theorem 2.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of parabolic solutions for advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel example of a divergence-free velocity field $b \in L^\infty ((0,1); L^p (\mathbb{T}^2))$ for $p&lt;2$ arbitrary but fixed which leads to non-unique solutions of advection-diffusion in the class $L^\infty_{t,x} \cap L^2_t H^1_x$ while satisfying the local energy inequality. This result complements the known uniqueness result of bounded solutions for divergence-free and $L^2_{t,x}$ integrable velocity fields. Additionally, we also prove the necessity of time integrability of the velocity field for the uniqueness result. More precisely, we construct another divergence-free velocity field $b \in L^p ((0,1); L^\infty (\mathbb{T}^2))$, for $p&lt; 2$ fixed, but arbitrary, with non-unique aforementioned solutions. Our contribution closes the gap between the regime of uniqueness and non-uniqueness in this context. Previously, it was shown with the convex integration technique that for $d\geq 3$ divergence-free velocity fields $ b \in L^\infty((0,1);L^p (\mathbb{T}^d))$ with $p &lt; \frac{2d}{d+2}$ could lead to non-unique solutions in the space $L^\infty_t L^{\frac{2d}{d-2}}_x \cap L^2_t H^1_x$. Our proof is based on a stochastic Lagrangian approach and does not rely on convex integration.</description>

      <title>Bounded Time Inverse Scattering for Semilinear Dirac Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first uniqueness result on the bounded time inverse scattering problem for a semilinear Dirac equation with smooth nonlinearity $F(x, z)$ where $(x, z)\in \mathbb{R}^3\times \mathbb{C}^4$ and $x$ is the spatial variable. We show that the solution map, which sends initial data at time 0 to the solution at time $T$, uniquely determines $F(x, z)$ on $x \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $|z| \leq M$, where $M$ is a constant depend on the solution map, under the assumption that $\partial_z F(x, 0)$ and $\partial^2_z F(x, 0)$ are known. In the proof, we construct a sequence of collisions approaching the initial timeline to simulate a boundary collision. This technique enables us to overcome the difficulties of this hyperbolic system without assumptions on the nonlinearity structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. Under the condition that the flow map fails to be twice differentiable, Hirayama, Kinoshita, and Okamoto (2022) proved the well-posedness by constructing a modified energy and applying the energy method. In the present paper, we improve the well-posedness result under the above condition by using the short-time Fourier restriction norm method.</description>

      <title>Intertwining diffusions and wave equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1306.0857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of intertwined diffusion processes of any dimension. Our main result gives an SDE construction of intertwinings of diffusion processes and shows that they correspond to nonnegative solutions of hyperbolic partial differential equations. For example, solutions of the classical wave equation correspond to the intertwinings of two Brownian motions. The theory allows us to unify many older examples of intertwinings, such as the process extension of the beta-gamma algebra, with more recent examples such as the ones arising in the study of two-dimensional growth models. We also find many new classes of intertwinings and develop systematic procedures for building more complex intertwinings by combining simpler ones. In particular, `orthogonal waves' combine unidimensional intertwinings to produce multidimensional ones. Connections with duality, time reversals and Doob's h-transforms are also explored.</description>

      <title>Uniform, localized asymptotics for sub-Riemannian heat kernels, their logarithmic derivatives, and associated diffusion bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.12888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the small-time asymptotics of the sub-Riemannian heat kernel, its derivatives, and its logarithmic derivatives can be localized, allowing them to be studied even on incomplete manifolds, under essentially optimal conditions on the distance to infinity. Continuing, away from abnormal minimizers, we show that the asymptotics are closely connected to the structure of the minimizing geodesics between the two relevant points (which is non-trivial on the cut locus). This gives uniform heat kernel bounds on compacts, and also allows a complete expansion of the heat kernel, and its derivatives, in a wide variety of cases.
  The method extends naturally to logarithmic derivatives of the heat kernel, where we again get uniform bounds on compacts and a more precise expansion for any particular pair of points, in most cases. In particular, we determine the measure giving the law of large numbers for the corresponding diffusion bridge, and the leading terms of the logarithmic derivatives are given by the cumulants of geometrically natural random variables with respect to this measure. One consequence is that the non-abnormal cut locus is characterized by the behavior of the log-Hessian of the heat kernel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential subalgebra of this algebra, which consists of linear generalized symmetries, is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration. We also establish an isomorphism between this algebra and the Lie algebra associated with the second Weyl algebra, which provides a dual perspective for studying their properties. After developing the theoretical background of finding exact solutions of homogeneous linear systems of differential equations using their linear generalized symmetries, we efficiently apply it to the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>On quantum ergodicity for higher dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study eigenfunction localization for higher dimensional cat maps, a popular model of quantum chaos. These maps are given by linear symplectic maps in ${\mathrm{Sp}}(2g,\mathbb Z)$, which we take to be ergodic. Under some natural assumptions, we show that there is a density one sequence of integers $N$ so that as $N$ tends to infinity along this sequence, all eigenfunctions of the quantized map at the inverse Planck constant $N$ are uniformly distributed. For the two-dimensional case ($g=1$), this was proved by P. Kurlberg and Z. Rudnick (2001). The higher dimensional case offers several new features and requires a completely different set of tools, including from additive combinatorics, in particular Bourgain's bound (2005) for Mordell sums, and a study of tensor product structures for the cat map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new solution to the classical black box problem (the discrete Calderon problem) in the theory of circular electrical networks. Our approach is based on the explicit embedding of electrical networks into non-negative Grassmannians and generalized chamber ansatz for it. Also, we reveal the relation of this problem with the combinatorial properties of spanning groves and the theory of totally non-negative matrices.
  Key words: electrical networks, discrete Calderon problem, discrete electrical impedance tomography, non-negative Grassmannians, twist for positroid variety, Temperley trick, totally non-negative matrices, effective resistances.</description>
