      <title>AniMAIRE -- A New Openly Available Tool for Calculating Atmospheric Ionising Radiation Dose Rates and Single Event Effects During Anisotropic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occasionally an eruption occurs on the surface of the Sun, ejecting high energy particles into the solar system in what are known as solar particle events. If this eruption of particles happens to hit Earth and have a sufficiently high kinetic energy, the particles can penetrate Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere, creating particle radiation showers that increase radiation dose rates in Earth's atmosphere. These situations are known as Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs), which typically occur once every few years. GLEs can cause aircraft electronics issues and cause passengers and crew to experience heightened radiation doses. In this paper, we describe a new, openly available model we've created to calculate dose rates in the atmosphere during GLEs, called AniMAIRE. Most models that currently exist can only calculate radiation dose rates when all particles are hitting Earth equally from all directions, however this approximation is generally only reliable during the later stages of events, and isn't accurate for many GLEs. AniMAIRE has been designed so it doesn't require this approximation, and can calculate dose rates for situations where it's supplied a direction-dependent particle flux. We also analyse the dose rate maps AniMAIRE produces when running across the GLE from 2012, finding several interesting results.</description>

      <title>Energy and temperature dependencies for electron-induced sputtering from H$_2$O-ice: Implications for the icy Galilean moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To better assess the role that electrons play in exosphere production on icy-rich bodies, we measured the total and O$_2$ sputtering yields from H$_2$O-ice for electrons with energies between 0.75 and 10 keV and temperatures between 15 and 124.5 K. We find that both total and O$_2$ yields increase with decreasing energy over our studied range, increase rapidly at temperatures above 60 K, and that the relative amount of H$_2$O in the sputtered flux decreases quickly with increasing energy. Combining our data with other electron data in literature, we show that the accuracy of a widely used sputtering model can be improved significantly for electrons by adjusting some of the intrinsic parameter values. Applying our results to Europa, we estimate that electrons contribute to the production of the O$_2$ exosphere equally to all ion types combined. In contrast, sputtering of O$_2$ from Ganymede and Callisto appears to be dominated by irradiating ions, though electrons still likely contribute a non-negligible amount. While our estimates could be further refined by examining the importance of spatial variations in electron flux, we conclude that, at the very least, electrons seem to be important for exosphere production on icy surfaces and should be included in future modeling efforts.</description>

      <title>The utility of infrasound in global monitoring of extraterrestrial impacts: A case study of the 23 July 2008 Tajikistan bolide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among various observational techniques used for detection of large bolides on a global scale is a low frequency sound known as infrasound. Infrasound, which is also one of the four sensing modalities used by the International Monitoring System (IMS), offers continuous global monitoring, and can be leveraged towards planetary defense. Infrasonic records can provide an additional dimension for event characterization and a distinct perspective that might not be available through any other observational method. This paper describes infrasonic detection and characterization of the bolide that disintegrated over Tajikistan on 23 July 2008. This event was detected by two infrasound stations at distances of 1530 and 2130 km. Propagation paths to one of the stations were not predicted by the model despite being clearly detected. The presence of the signal is attributed to the acoustic energy being trapped in a weak but leaky stratospheric AtmoSOFAR channel. The infrasound signal analysis indicates that the shock originated at the point of the main breakup at an altitude of 35 km. The primary mode of shock production of the signal detected at the two stations was a spherical blast resulting from the main gross fragmentation episode. The energy estimate, based on the signal period, is 0.17-0.51 kt of TNT equivalent, suggesting a mass of 6.6-23.5 tons. The corresponding object radius, assuming the chondritic origin, was 0.78-1.18 m.</description>

      <title>Towards Synthetic Magnetic Turbulence with Coherent Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic turbulence is a relevant tool to study complex astrophysical and space plasma environments inaccessible by direct simulation. However, conventional models lack intermittent coherent structures, which are essential in realistic turbulence. We present a novel method, featuring coherent structures, conditional structure function scaling and fieldline curvature statistics comparable to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Enhanced transport of charged particles is investigated as well. This method presents significant progress towards physically faithful synthetic turbulence.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor at Mars with Uncertainty Quantification using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single spacecraft missions do not measure the pristine solar wind continuously because of the spacecrafts' orbital trajectory. The infrequent spatiotemporal cadence of measurement fundamentally limits conclusions about solar wind-magnetosphere coupling throughout the solar system. At Mars, such single spacecraft missions result in limitations for assessing the solar wind's role in causing lower altitude observations such as auroral dynamics or atmospheric loss. In this work, we detail the development of a virtual solar wind monitor from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission; a single spacecraft. This virtual solar wind monitor provides a continuous estimate of the solar wind upstream from Mars with uncertainties. We specifically employ Gaussian process regression to estimate the upstream solar wind and uncertainty estimations that scale with the data sparsity of our real observations. This proxy enables continuous solar wind estimation at Mars with representative uncertainties for the majority of the time since since late 2014. We conclude by discussing suggested uses of this virtual solar wind monitor for statistical studies of the Mars space environment and heliosphere.</description>
