      <title>LLMs and Agentic AI in Insurance Decision-Making: Opportunities and Challenges For Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI, in the insurance sector. We consider and emphasize the unique opportunities, challenges, and potential pathways in insurance amid rapid performance improvements, increased open-source access, decreasing deployment costs, and the complexity of LLM or agentic AI frameworks. To bring it closer to home, we identify critical gaps in the African insurance market and highlight key local efforts, players, and partnership opportunities. Finally, we call upon actuaries, insurers, regulators, and tech leaders to a collaborative effort aimed at creating inclusive, sustainable, and equitable AI strategies and solutions: by and for Africans.</description>

      <title>Estimating profitable price bounds for prescriptive price optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pricing of products and services, which has a significant impact on consumer demand, is one of the most important factors in maximizing business profits. Prescriptive price optimization is a prominent data-driven pricing methodology consisting of two phases: demand forecasting and price optimization. In the practice of prescriptive price optimization, the price of each item is typically set within a predetermined range defined by lower and upper bounds. Narrow price ranges can lead to missed opportunities, while wide price ranges run the risk of proposing unrealistic prices; therefore, determining profitable price bounds while maintaining the reliability of the suggested prices is a critical challenge that directly affects the effectiveness of prescriptive price optimization. We propose two methods for estimating price bounds in prescriptive price optimization so that future total revenue derived from the optimized prices will be maximized. Our first method for price bounds estimation uses the bootstrap procedure to estimate confidence intervals for optimal prices. Our second method uses the Nelder--Mead simplex method for black-box price bounds optimization that maximizes total revenue estimated through $K$-fold cross-validation. Experimental results with synthetic price--demand datasets demonstrate that our methods successfully narrowed down the price range while maintaining high revenues, particularly when the number of items was small or the demand noise level was low. Moreover, as more data accumulated, the comparative advantage of our methods further increased.</description>

      <title>HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.</description>

      <title>Graph topology estimation of power grids using pairwise mutual information of time series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. This manuscript explores the application of this method to different datasets and explores the domain of applicability. The data quality, precision, time windows, frequency and the method for calculating the mutual information are varied to see the effect on the successful reconstruction of the graph and it's leaf nodes. Success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks.</description>
