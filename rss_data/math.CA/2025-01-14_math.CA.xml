      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study sequences of positive numbers preserving summability. In particular, the open set property for such a family of sequences is shown. Several classes of sequences preserving summability, including polynomials, sums of powers, and solutions of some difference equations, are introduced.</description>

      <title>Two inequalities for commutators of singular integral operators satisfying H\"{o}rmander conditions of Young type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the Fefferman-Stein inequality and Coifman-Fefferman inequality for the general commutators of singular integral operators that satisfy H\"{o}rmander conditions of Young type. Specifically, we first establish the pointwise sparse domination for these operators. Then, relying on the dyadic analysis, the Fefferman-Stein inequality with respect to arbitrary weights and the quantitative weighted Coifman-Fefferman inequality are demonstrated. We decouple the relationship between the number of commutators and the index $\varepsilon$, which essentially improved the results of P\'{e}rez and Rivera-R\'{\i}os (Israel J. Math., 2017). As applications, it is shown that all the aforementioned results can be applied to a wide range of operators, such as singular integral operators satisfying the $L^r$-H\"{o}rmander operators, $\omega$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators with $\omega$ satisfying a Dini condition, Calder\'{o}n commutators, homogeneous singular integral operators and Fourier multipliers.</description>

      <title>Stieltjes differential systems with non monotonic derivators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study Stieltjes differential systems of which the derivators are allowed to change sign. This leads to the definition of the notion of \emph{function of controlled variation}, a characterization of precompact sets of $g$-continuous functions, and an explicit expression of $g$-exponential maps. Finally, we prove a Peano-type existence result and apply it to a model of fluid stratification on buoyant miscible jets and plumes.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of solution for Stieltjes differential equations with several derivators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some existence and uniqueness results for systems of differential equations in which each of equations of the system involves a different Stieltjes derivative. Specifically, we show that this problems can only have one solution under the Osgood condition, or even, the Montel-Tonelli condition. We also explore some results guaranteeing the existence of solution under these conditions. Along the way, we obtain some interesting properties for the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral associated to a finite sum of nondecreasing and left-continuous maps, as well as a characterization of the pseudometric topologies defined by this type of maps.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>

      <title>Generalized dichotomies via time rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For discrete-time nonautonomous linear dynamics and a large class of discrete growth rates $\mu$, we show that the notion of $\mu$ dichotomy (with respect to a sequence of norms) can be completely characterized in terms of ordinary and exponential dichotomy (with respect to a sequence of norms) by employing a suitable rescaling of time. Previously, such a result was known only in the particular case of polynomial dichotomies. As a nontrivial application of our results, we study the structure of a generalized Sacker-Sell spectrum and obtain a series of nonautonomous topological and smooth linearization results.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous bifurcation of limit cycles for Piecewise Holomorphic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\dot{z}=f(z)$ be a holomorphic differential equation with center at $p$. In this paper we are concerned about studying the piecewise perturbation systems $\dot{z}=f(z)+\epsilon R^\pm(z,\overline{z}),$ where $R^\pm(z,\overline{z})$ are complex polynomials defined for $\pm\operatorname{Im}(z)&gt; 0.$ We provide an integral expression, similar to an Abelian integral, for the period annulus of $p.$ The zeros of this integral control the bifurcating limit cycles from the periodic orbits of this annular region. This expression is given in terms of the conformal conjugation between $\dot{z}=f(z)$ and its linearization $\dot{z}=f'(p)z$ at $p$. We use this result to control the simultaneous bifurcation of limit cycles of the two annular periods of $\dot{z}={\rm i} (z^2-1)/2$, after both complex and holomorphic piecewise polynomial perturbations. In particular, as far as we know, we provide the first proof of the existence of non nested limit cycles for piecewise holomorphic systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Two Pointwise Ergodic Theorems: Double Recurrence and Return Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to extensions of Bourgain's Double Recurrence Theorem and Bourgain's Return Times Theorem to integer parts of the Kronecker sequence, emphasizing stopping times and metric entropy. Specifically, we prove the following two results for each $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$:
  First, for each $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving system, $(X,\mu,T)$, and each $f,g \in L^{\infty}(X)$, for each $\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}$ the bilinear ergodic averages
  \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor \alpha n \rfloor } f \cdot T^{\lfloor \gamma n \rfloor} g \]
  converge $\mu$-a.e.;
  Second, for each aperiodic and countably generated measure-preserving system, $(Y,\nu,S)$, and each $g \in L^{\infty}(Y)$, there exists a subset $Y_{g} \subset Y$ with $\nu(Y_{g})= 1$ so that for all $\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $\omega \in Y_{g}$, for any auxiliary $\sigma$-finite measure-preserving system $(X,\mu,T)$, and any $f \in L^{\infty}(X)$, the ``return-times" averages \[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n \leq N} T^{\lfloor \alpha n \rfloor} f \cdot S^{\lfloor \gamma n \rfloor } g(\omega) \] converge $\mu$-a.e.
  Moreover, in both cases the sets of convergence are identical for all $\gamma \in \mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Rank, two-color partitions and Mock theta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish that the number of partitions of a natural number with positive odd rank is equal to the number of two-color partitions (red and blue), where the smallest part is even (say $2n$) and all red parts are even and lie within the interval $(2n,4n]$. This led us to derive a new representation for the third order mock theta function $f_3(q)$ and an analogue of the fundamental identity for the smallest part partition function Spt$(n)$, both of which are of significant interest in their own right. We also consider the odd smallest part version of the above two-color partition, whose generating function involves another third order mock theta function $\phi_3(q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Besov spaces with dominating mixed smoothness, on the product of the real line and the torus as well as bounded domains, are studied. A characterization of these function spaces in terms of differences is provided. Applications to random fields, like Gaussian fields and the stochastic heat equation, are discussed, based on a Kolmogorov criterion for Besov regularity with dominating mixed smoothness.</description>

Abstract: The notion of pointwise differentials for distributions is a way to extract local information of distributions by rescaling the distribution at a point. In this paper, we study the pointwise differentials for distributions corresponding to a negative order Sobolev functions. Our main results prove Borel regularity, Lusin approximation, rectifiability, and a Rademacher theorem for these pointwise differentials.</description>

      <title>Expansion formulas for elliptic hypergeometric series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternate approach to obtaining expansion formulas on the lines of the well-poised Bailey lemma. We recover results due to Spiridonov and Warnaar and one new formula of this type. These formulas contain an arbitrary sequence as an argument, and are thus flexible in the number of parameters they contain. As a result, we are able to derive $19$ new transformation formulas for elliptic hypergeometric series. These transformation formulas appear to be new even in the basic hypergeometric case, when $p=0$.</description>

      <title>A note on the log-perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on the hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the log-perturbed Br\'ezis-Nirenberg problem on the hyperbolic space
  \begin{align*}
  \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N}u+\lambda u +|u|^{p-1}u+\theta u \ln u^2 =0, \ \ \ \ u \in H^1(\mathbb{B}^N), \ u &gt; 0 \ \mbox{in} \ \mathbb{B}^N,
  \end{align*}
  and study the existence vs non-existence results. We show that whenever $\theta &gt;0,$ there exists an $H^1$-solution, while for $\theta &lt;0$, there does not exist a positive solution in a reasonably general class. Since the perturbation $ u \ln u^2$ changes sign, Pohozaev type identities do not yield any non-existence results. The main contribution of this article is obtaining an "almost" precise lower asymptotic decay estimate on the positive solutions for $\theta &lt;0,$ culminating in proving their non-existence assertion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators of index zero to deal with periodic even solutions of the one-dimensional equation $\mathcal{L}u=\lambda u+|u|^{p}$, where $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonlocal pseudodifferential operator defined as a Fourier multiplier and $\lambda$ is the bifurcation parameter. Our general setting includes the fractional Laplacian $\mathcal{L}\equiv(-\Delta)^{s}$ and sharpens the results obtained for this operator to date. As a direct application, we establish the existence of traveling waves for general nonlocal dispersive equations for some velocity ranges.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$ regularity problem for parabolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23801v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we fully resolve the question of whether the Regularity problem for the parabolic PDE $-\partial_tu + \mbox{div}(A\nabla u)=0$ on a Lipschitz cylinder $\mathcal O\times\mathbb R$ is solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ under the assumption that the matrix $A$ is elliptic, has bounded and measurable coefficients and its coefficients satisfy a natural Carleson condition (a parabolic analog of the so-called DKP-condition).
  We prove that for some $p_0&gt;1$ the Regularity problem is solvable in the range $(1,p_0)$. We note that answer to this question was not known even in the small Carleson case, that is, when the Carleson norm of coefficients is sufficiently small.
  In the elliptic case the analogous question was only fully resolved recently independently by two groups, with two very different methods: one involving two of the authors and S. Hofmann, the second by M. Mourgoglou, B. Poggi and X. Tolsa. Our approach in the parabolic case is motivated by that of the first group, but in the parabolic setting there are significant new challenges.</description>

      <title>Approximations by special values of multiple cosine and sine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kurokawa and Koyama's multiple cosine function $\mathcal{C}_{r}(x)$ and Kurokawa's multiple sine function $S_{r}(x)$ are generalizations of the classical cosine and sine functions from their infinite product representations, respectively. For any fixed $x\in[0,\frac{1}{2})$, let
  $$B=\left\{\frac{\log\mathcal{C}_{r}(x)}{\pi}~~\bigg|~~r=1,2,3,\ldots\right\}$$
  and $$C=\left\{\frac{\log S_r(x)}{\pi}~~\bigg|~~r=1,2,3,\ldots\right\}$$
  be the sets of special values of $\mathcal{C}_{r}(x)$ and $S_{r}(x)$ at $x$, respectively.
  In this paper, we will show that the real numbers can be strongly approximated by linear combinations of elements in $B$ and $C$ respectively, with rational coefficients. Furthermore, let $$D=\left\{\frac{\zeta_{E}(3)}{\pi^2},\frac{\zeta_{E}(5)}{\pi^4}, \ldots, \frac{\zeta_{E}(2k+1)}{\pi^{2k}},\ldots; \frac{\beta(4)}{\pi^3},\frac{\beta(6)}{\pi^5}, \ldots, \frac{\beta(2k+2)}{\pi^{2k+1}},\ldots\right\}$$ be the set of special values of Dirichlet's eta and beta functions. We will prove that the set $D$ has a similar approximation property, where the coefficients are values of the derivatives of rational polynomials. Our approaches are inspired by recent works of Alkan (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 143: 3743--3752, 2015) and Lupu-Wu (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 545: Article ID 129144, 2025) as applications of the trigonometric integrals.</description>

      <title>A primer of the complex WKB method, with application to the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures, we provide an introduction to the complex WKB method, using as a guiding example a class of anharmonic oscillators that appears in the ODE/IM correspondence. In the first three lectures, we introduce the main objects of the method, such as the WKB function, the integral equations of Volterra type, the quadratic differential and its horizontal/Stokes lines, the Stokes phenomenon, the notion of asymptotic values, the Fock-Goncharov coordinates and their WKB approximation. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillators in two asymptotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when the momentum (hence also the energy) is large.</description>
