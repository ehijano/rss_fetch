      <title>High critical current densities of body-centered cubic high-entropy alloy superconductors: recent research progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloy (HEA) superconductors have garnered significant attention due to their unique characteristics, such as robust superconductivity under extremely high pressure and irradiation, the cocktail effect, and the enhancement of the upper critical field. A high critical current density is another noteworthy feature observed in HEAs. Several body-centered cubic (bcc) HEAs have exhibited critical current densities comparable to those of Nb-Ti superconducting alloys. Such HEAs hold potential for applications as multifunctional superconducting wires, a capability rarely achieved in conventional alloys. In this context, we review recent advancements in research on critical current densities in bcc HEA superconductors, including Ta$_{1/6}$Nb$_{2/6}$Hf$_{1/6}$Zr$_{1/6}$Ti$_{1/6}$, (TaNb)$_{0.7}$(HfZrTi)$_{0.5}$, NbScTiZr, and others. Comparative analyses among these HEAs reveal that both eutectic microstructures, which accompany lattice strain, and nanosized precipitates play pivotal roles in achieving elevated critical current densities across wide magnetic field ranges. Furthermore, we propose several future directions for research. These include elucidating the origin of lattice strain, exploring more fine eutectic microstructures, artificially introducing nanoscale pinning sites, improving the superconducting critical temperature, and investigating the mechanical properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally large winding number of a finite-size topological superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-size-induced topological phenomena in unconventional superconductors. Specifically, we focus on a thin film with a persistent spin texture, fabricated on a high-$T_{\text{c}}$ cuprate $d_{xy}$-wave superconductors. In two-dimensional $d_{xy}$-wave superconductors, flat-band Andreev bound states appear at the edges. As the system narrows, these bound states acquire an energy gap due to finite-size hybridization and spin-orbit coupling of the persistent spin texture. This induced gap gives rise to the emergence of a topological phase, characterized by an exceptionally large one-dimensional winding number that scales with the film width. We demonstrate the appearance of highly degenerate zero-energy states, leading to anomalous perfect charge transport in dirty superconducting junctions. These findings provide a promising platform for exploring fascinating topological superconducting phases driven by gapped Andreev bound states.</description>

      <title>Current-Enabled Optical Conductivity of Collective Modes in Unconventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the current-enabled linear optical conductivity of collective modes in superconductors with unconventional pairing symmetries. After deriving general formulas for the optical conductivity of a superconductor featuring multiple pairing channels and bands using the path integral formalism, we apply these formulas to several models. Using a model of competing s- and d-wave pairing interactions, we find that several known collective modes generate peaks in the optical conductivity upon injection of a supercurrent. This includes single- and multiband versions of Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, mixed-symmetry Bardasis-Schrieffer modes, and Leggett modes. Using a model for interband p-wave superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, we find that in such a system Bardasis-Schrieffer modes are optically active even without introducing a supercurrent. In a p+ip chiral ground state, these modes turn out to produce peaks in the longitudinal and transverse optical conductivity. Other collective modes belonging to the chiral p+ip order parameter turn out to be unaffected by the spin-orbit coupling but contribute to the optical response when a supercurrent is introduced. These results promise new avenues for the observation of collective modes in a variety of superconducting systems, including multiband superconductors and superconductors that feature multiple pairing channels or multi-component order parameters, such as chiral p- or d-wave superconductors.</description>

      <title>Intertwining Josephson and Vortex Topologies in Conventional Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have unveiled promising evidence of vortex-bound Majorana quasiparticles in multiple superconducting compounds. However, theoretical progress in understanding these phenomena, especially from ab initio approaches, has been limited by the computational complexity of simulating vortex structures. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Josephson-vortex correspondence (JVC), a theoretical framework that systematically maps the bound-state topological properties of vortices to those of $\pi$-phase Josephson junctions in the same superconductor. This correspondence allows vortex phase diagrams to be constructed directly from junction calculations, thereby eliminating the need for large-scale vortex calculations. We demonstrate the validity and predictive power of JVC across a variety of effective models, and further extend the framework to the first-principles level. Applying our approach to 2M-WS$_2$ and Sr$_3$SnO, we identify them as realistic, doping-tunable platforms for realizing vortex Majorana zero modes. Our theory will pave the way for ab initio Majorana material discovery and design.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity from spin polarized Chern band in twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been observed in twisted MoTe2 within the anomalous Hall metal parent state. Key signatures-including a fully spin/valley polarized normal state, anomalous Hall resistivity hysteresis, superconducting phase adjacent to the fractional Chern insulating state and a narrow superconducting dome at zero gating field-collectively indicate chiral superconductivity driven by intravalley pairing of electrons. Within the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, we compute the superconducting phase diagram via random phase approximation, incorporating Coulomb repulsion in a realistic continuum model. Our results identify a dominant intravalley pairing with a narrow superconducting dome of p+ip type at zero gate field. This chiral phase contrasts sharply with the much weaker time-reversal-symmetric intervalley pairing at finite gating field. Our work highlights the role of band topology in achieving robust topological superconductivity, and supports the chiral and topological nature of the superconductivity observed in twisted MoTe2.</description>

      <title>Pauli 'unlimited': magnetic field induced-superconductivity in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of extreme field-boosted superconductivity in uranium ditelluride, we present a scenario in which superconductivity can be induced by a strong Zeeman field, rather than destroyed by it, as is the case in Pauli-limited superconductivity. The resulting superconducting state has an upper critical field far greater than the superconducting transition temperature, and with spin-orbit coupling, it is sensitive to the field orientation. We demonstrate the interplay between superconductivity and metamagnetism in a simple effective theory.</description>

      <title>Properties and prevalence of false poor man's Majoranas in two- and three-site artificial Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was predicted that a minimal chain of two quantum dots (QDs) connected via a superconductor can host perfectly localized zero-energy states, known as poor man's Majoranas (PMMs). It is expected that these states are related to Majorana bound states (MBSs) in longer chains and that the tunable nature of this setup makes it a promising platform to study MBSs. However, realistic systems can only host highly, but not perfectly, localized near-zero-energy states, called imperfect PMMs. It has been shown that these imperfect PMMs can evolve into trivial states unrelated to MBSs when the chain is extended. Such states are called false PMMs, whereas PMMs that evolve into MBSs in long chains are called true PMMs. Here, using a microscopic model of QD-superconductor arrays, we consider properties of false PMMs and the circumstances under which they appear. In two-site systems, we find that the origin of many false PMMs can be related to zero-energy states occurring in the absence of superconductivity and we use this analytic understanding to characterize the false PMMs that are typical for different regions of parameter space. In three-site systems, we show that false PMMs can occur via the same mechanism as for two-site systems, but we also find them in regions of parameter space where they are not predicted to exist, thus hinting that the physics of false PMMs can be richer in longer chains. Finally, we demonstrate that the PMMs most stable to perturbations in chemical potential and with the largest excitation gaps appear in a region of parameter space that also has a large ratio of false to true PMMs.</description>

      <title>Emergent Theory for Constitutive Relations in Classical Defect Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical, acoustic, hydrodynamic, and thermal defect systems are often studied by analogy with each other. This may indicate that we may find a emergent theory for constitutive relations of classical defect systems. Start with thermal systems, we put up with a bootstrap method to describe classical transport. We conjecture that Landau-Khalatnikov equation could provide heat constitutive relations when taking heat flux as order parameter. We show that the corresponding effctive Lagrangian has similar form of that of Wick-rotated complex scalar field theory at non-relativistic limit, and only in perfect conducting situation that this system is a canonical ensemble. We argue that our method could be generalized to other systems besides thermal ones. By analogy with ferroelectrics, we propose the thermal domain model, which is a conserved current XY model. Phase transition of the thermal system is qualitatively discussed in this model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of unconventional superconductivity near reentrant and fractional quantum anomalous Hall insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e Chern bands provide an exceptional platform for exploring a variety of many-body electronic liquid and solid phases at zero magnetic field within a lattice system. One particular intriguing possibility is that flat Chern bands can, in principle, support exotic superconducting phases together with fractional topological phases. Here, we report the observation of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects, the reentrant quantum anomalous Hall effect, and superconductivity within the first moir\'e Chern band of twisted bilayer MoTe2. The superconducting phase emerges from a normal state exhibiting anomalous Hall effects and sustains an large perpendicular critical magnetic field. Our results present the first example of superconductivity emerging within a flat Chern band that simultaneously hosts fractional quantum anomalous effects, a phenomenon never observed in any other systems. Our work expands the understanding of emergent quantum phenomena in moir\'e Chern bands, and offers a nearly ideal platform for engineering Majorana and parafermion zero modes in gate-controlled hybrid devices.</description>

      <title>Nonhermitian topological zero modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary modes localized at the edges of topologically nontrivial systems. The wavefunctions of hermitian boundary modes can be obtained as the eigenmode of a modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation. Recently, the bulk-boundary correspondence has been extended to nonhermitian systems, which describe physical phenomena such as gain and loss in open and non-equilibrium systems. Nonhermitian energy spectra can be complex-valued and exhibit point gaps or line gaps in the complex plane, whether the gaps can be continuously deformed into points or lines, respectively. Specifically, line-gapped nonhermitian systems can be continuously deformed into hermitian gapped spectra. Here, we find the analytical form of the wavefunctions of nonhermitian boundary modes with zero energy localized at smooth domain boundaries between topologically distinct phases, by solving the generalized Jackiw-Rebbi equation in the nonhermitian regime. Moreover, we unveil a universal relation between the scalar fields and the decay rate and oscillation wavelength of the boundary modes. This relation quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in nonhermitian line-gapped systems in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities and is not affected by the details of the spatial dependence of the scalar fields. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of boundary modes in nonhermitian and topologically nontrivial states of matter.</description>

      <title>Detecting the topological winding of superconducting nodes via Local Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many systems are topologically trivial in the bulk, but still have non-trivial wavefunctions locally in the Brillouin zone. For example, in a small-gap Dirac material the Berry curvature is strongly peaked, but cancels over the full Brillouin zone, while in semimetals and in nodal superconductors there may be a lower-dimensional winding topology associated to the nodes. Experimentally, it is difficult to directly observe such topology. We consider general bulk Hamiltonians with nodes and chiral symmetry, extending to them the method developed in Dutreix et al. [Nature, 574(7777):219-222 (2019)], which in particular detected the winding around Dirac cones in graphene using charge modulations around an impurity. We apply our method to nodal superconductors in 2d, in presence of a (non)magnetic impurity, measured by standard or spin-polarized STM tip. We derive general conditions on the impurity scattering and on the STM tip, expressed in terms of their preference among the two chiralities, for when the measurement near the impurity captures the winding difference between any chosen pair of (Bogoliubon) Dirac cones. We emphasize the robustness of observing vortices in momentum space, in contrast to dislocations in real space, in STM data. Testing the conditions on the topological nodal superconductor proposed for monolayer NbSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field, we find that spin-polarized STM on a magnetic impurity can detect the winding of each of the 12 nodes. We conclude that a judicious choice of impurity can be a powerful tool to determine topological quantities in 2d superconducting systems as well as any nodal chiral system.</description>
