      <title>Dynamical equation for quark spin polarization in the rotating medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the produced quark-gluon plasma (QGP) behaves approximately as a rotating fluid due to the system's initial angular momentum. In this rotating fluid, the spins of quarks become polarized due to the coupling between spin and angular momentum, as well as random spin-spin interactions. Since the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation effectively describes the spin polarization of fermions in a medium with a magnetic field, we derive a phenomenological equation analogous to the LL equation for heavy quark spin dynamics in the rotating medium. The spin-angular momentum coupling and random spin-spin interactions are incorporated, leading to a detailed balance of heavy quark spin distributions. This equation provides insight into the spin dynamics of heavy quarks and quarkonium in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of proton- and deuteron-induced one-proton knockout reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ratios of the one-proton knockout cross sections by a deuteron to those by a proton are about 1.5, indicating that using deuteron is more efficient than proton in yielding large knockout cross sections. However, this ratio differs from the intuitive expectation, and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism behind the observed ratio by theoretically describing and analyzing the deuteron- and proton-induced one-proton knockout reactions. Proton-induced one-proton knockout reactions are described within the standard distorted-wave impulse approximation (DWIA) framework, while deuteron-induced one-proton knockout reactions are treated with a new approach, DWIA-BU, that incorporates deuteron breakup into the DWIA. The ratios calculated with the DWIA-BU reproduce the experimental data reasonably, whereas those with the DWIA significantly underestimate them. The ratio of the corresponding elementary cross sections remains about 3.5 regardless of the energy, and the difference in absorption between the deuteron and the proton influences the ratios of knockout cross sections, resulting in agreement between the calculated ratios and the experimental data. It is found that the deuteron breakup is essential to reproduce the experimental ratio. The ratios of the knockout cross sections are primarily determined by the difference in the elementary cross sections and that in the absorption between the deuteron and the proton.</description>

      <title>From closed shells to open shells: Coupled-cluster calculations of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled-cluster theory is a powerful tool for first-principles calculations of atomic nuclei, enabling accurate predictions of nuclear observables across the Segr\`e chart. While coupled-cluster computations are especially efficient at shell closures, extensions have been developed to tackle open-shell nuclei, by exploiting the equation-of-motion method or by expanding the coupled-cluster wave function on top of a symmetry-breaking (either deformed or superfluid) reference state. In this study, we provide a comprehensive comparison of these different formulations applied to the calcium and nickel isotopes using nuclear two- and three-body interactions from chiral effective field theory. Based on ground-state energies, two-neutron separation energies, and two-neutron shell gaps, different coupled-cluster computations - based on symmetry-broken reference states and equation-of-motion techniques - offer consistent descriptions of bulk properties across medium-mass isotopic chains.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Theory Bounds on the Equation of State of Dense QCD Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive bounds on the equation of state of cold, dense matter by extending the causal, model-agnostic interpolation between chiral effective field theory and perturbative calculations with a microscopic constraint from relativistic kinetic theory. The additional condition restricts the stiffest admissible behavior of the equation of state and systematically reduces the range of allowed equations of state, with the strongest effect at high densities. The resulting bounds remain consistent with known low- and high-density limits, while the strength of the constraint depends on the density above which the kinetic-theory condition is applied. These bounds can be readily incorporated into future studies of cold, dense matter and used to assess the impact of microscopic stability conditions on equation-of-state inference.</description>

      <title>Towards a fluid-dynamic description of an entire heavy-ion collision: from the colliding nuclei to the quark-gluon plasma phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid-dynamical modeling of a nuclear collision at high energy usually starts shortly after the collision. A major source of uncertainty comes from the detailed modeling of the initial state. While the collision itself likely involves far-from-equilibrium dynamics, it is not excluded that a fluid theory of second order can reasonably well describe its soft features. Here we explore this possibility and discuss how the state before the collision can be described in that setup, examine the required fluid-dynamical equations of motion and study the resulting entropy production. While we do here only first steps, we outline a larger program, which could lead to a dynamical description of heavy-ion collisions where the only uncertainty lies in the thermodynamic and transport properties of quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Reduced basis emulator for elastic scattering in continuum-discretized coupled-channel calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a reduced basis emulator for continuum-discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) calculations that achieves speedups of $\sim 10^2$ while maintaining sub-percent accuracy. The emulator is constructed using the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method applied to snapshots of CDCC solutions computed at sampled points in the optical potential parameter space. The prediction is performed via Galerkin projection onto the reduced basis. I demonstrate the method using deuteron scattering on $^{58}$Ni at 21.6 MeV as a test case, emulating 18 optical potential parameters simultaneously. The emulator reproduces elastic scattering cross sections with errors below 0.1\% across a wide parameter range. This development enables efficient uncertainty quantification and Bayesian parameter estimation for nuclear reaction calculations that were previously computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Active learning emulators for nuclear two-body scattering in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the active learning emulators for two-body scattering in coordinate space with error estimation, recently developed by Maldonado et al. in Phys. Rev. C \textbf{112}, 024002, to coupled-channel scattering in momentum space. Our full-order model (FOM) solver is based on the Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation for the scattering $t$-matrix as opposed to the radial Schr\"odinger equation. We use (Petrov-)Galerkin projections and high-fidelity calculations at a few snapshots across the parameter space of the interaction to construct efficient reduced-order models (ROMs), trained by a greedy algorithm for locally optimal snapshot selection. Both the FOM solver and the corresponding ROMs are implemented efficiently in Python using Google's JAX library. We present results for emulating scattering phase shifts in coupled and uncoupled channels and cross sections, and assess the accuracy of the developed ROMs and their computational speed-up factors. We also develop emulator error estimation for both the $t$-matrix and the total cross section. The software framework for reproducing and extending our results will be made publicly available. Together with our recent advances in developing active-learning emulators for three-body scattering, these emulator frameworks set the stage for full Bayesian calibrations of chiral nuclear interactions and optical models against scattering data with quantified emulator errors.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>The anomalous magnetic moment of the muon: status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the status of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as a precision probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) after the release of the final results from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon $g-2$ experiment and the second White Paper of the Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative. While the SM prediction requires further improvements by a factor of four to fully leverage the sensitivity achieved in experiment, the FNAL measurement will set the standard for many years to come, and we discuss a variety of features of the experimental campaign that made this achievement possible. In going forward, we discuss current efforts to improve the SM prediction, and imagine how an experiment would have to be devised to surpass 124 ppb in precision.</description>

      <title>Early-Time Dynamics of Heavy-Ion Collisions through Energy Correlators: celestial blocks and the spacetime structure of out-of-equilibrium QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions provide a unique window into far-from-equilibrium states of QCD matter. The initial stages of these events are characterized by highly anisotropic, nonthermal dynamics that precede hydrodynamization, yet they remain largely inaccessible through conventional soft observables. In this work, we show that the substructure of mid-rapidity jets provides direct sensitivity to the spacetime structure of this early, anisotropic phase. Using classical Yang-Mills simulations and effective kinetic theory to model the early-time evolution of the jet quenching parameter, we compute the azimuthally differential energy-energy correlator within the BDMPS-Z framework. By decomposing the result into celestial blocks, we isolate the coefficients that encode the anisotropic geometry and dynamics of the underlying medium. We identify an observable that couples directly to spatial anisotropies in the out-of-equilibrium QCD matter and also discuss the impact of medium response on its behavior. We further extend our study to mid-rapidity jets generated with the JEWEL Monte-Carlo, adjusted to incorporate an anisotropic medium background, and find qualitative agreement with the analytical expectations. Finally, we discuss how higher-point energy correlators and generalized energy-flow operators can enhance the sensitivity to the microscopic structure of far-from-equilibrium QCD matter.</description>

      <title>A Brief History and Outlook of Hadronic Physics in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic physics has gradually emerged as one of the growing research frontiers in Indonesia, driven by efforts to better understand the properties of the strong interaction and the internal structure of hadrons from the fundamental principles of Quantum Chromodynamics. In the last few decades, Indonesian researchers have made significant contributions to developing various theoretical and phenomenological aspects of hadrons. In addition, on the experimental side, Indonesian scientists have participated in hadron experiment facilities overseas, such as the ALICE collaboration at CERN, which has strengthened the scientific activities and networks and has supported the training of young Indonesian researchers. In the present paper, we review Indonesian scientists' contributions to hadronic physics, highlight ongoing research directions in both experimental and theoretical, and outline strategies for future development toward integration into the international hadronic physics community.</description>

      <title>Evidence for dynamical chiral condensate in high-energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics with light quarks features an approximate global symmetry, known as chiral symmetry, that is believed to be spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar and isoscalar composite field, in addition to a small explicit breaking due to finite quark masses. For a high enough temperature, as achieved in the early universe or the fireball created by a high-energy heavy ion collision, this symmetry is expected to be restored. We show theoretically that a coherent deviation of the corresponding quantum field from its usual vacuum expectation value on the freeze-out hypersurface of a heavy-ion collision leads, after resonance decays, to a characteristic contribution to the transverse momentum spectrum of charged pions, in the very soft regime, consistent with experimental data from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and the Large Hadron Collider. Taken together, the experimental data with the new theoretical results provide compelling support for the existence of a chiral condensation mechanism with partial restoration of chiral symmetry at high temperature.</description>

Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass spectra of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$, and the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to X(3872)\pi^+ \pi^-)$. The strong final state interactions between the two pseudoscalars are taken into account using a parametrization fulfilling unitarity and analyticity. We find that there is universality in the coupling constants for $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_s^0 \to J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ processes. While the couplings of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^-$ are about half of magnitude smaller than the couplings of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$, which indicates that the $X(3872)$ is different from a pure charmonium state. Furthermore, we find that the $f_0(1500)$ plays an important role in the $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S) \pi^+\pi^-$ and the $B_s^0 \to X(3872) \pi^+\pi^- (K^+ K^-)$ processes, though the phase space of $B_s^0 \to X(3872) f_0(1500)$ is small. Also we predict the ratio of branch fractions $\mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}]/ \mathcal{B}[B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)\pi^+ \pi^-]$ and the $K^+ K^-$ invariant mass distribution of $B_s^0 \to \psi(2S)(K^+K^-)_{{\rm non-}\phi}$.</description>

      <title>From Lead to Helium: Discovery Potential for Jet Quenching in the Smallest Collision Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) predictions for the modification to the yield of high-momentum particles in very light ion collisions - ${}^{10}\mathrm{B} + {}^{10}\mathrm{B}$, ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li} + {}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He} + {}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ - both with and without medium-induced energy loss. We show that there is non-trivial suppression expected from our partonic energy loss model in symmetric systems from ${}^{208}\mathrm{Pb} + {}^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ to ${}^{3}\mathrm{He} + {}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and in asymmetric systems $A + B$, and that the energy loss scales approximately with $(\sqrt{A B})^{1 / 3}$. Further, we find that deep inelastic scattering measurements in ${}^{3}\mathrm{He}$ and ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}$ tightly constrain the nPDF baseline, making these isotopes a particularly clean environment for observing final-state partonic energy loss induced by the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in these very small systems.</description>

Abstract: We extend the concept of natural orbitals as an optimized single-particle basis for ab initio nuclear many-body calculations to hypernuclei and show that their superior properties, in particular accelerated convergence and independence of the underlying harmonic-oscillator frequency, can be directly transferred to the hypernuclear regime as demonstrated in no-core shell model calculations for selected p-shell hypernuclei. Moreover, the radial single-particle wavefunctions associated with the natural-orbital basis yield important structural information with respect to the different particle species allowing us to identify a hyperon halo in {\Lambda}He5. We further explore nucleonic and hyperonic halo structures in A=6 and A=7 singly-strange hypernuclei based on one-body densities and point-particle radii obtained from no-core shell model calculations with realistic interactions from chiral effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Correlations of Electromagnetic Properties in Ab Initio Calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ab initio nuclear structure theory, accurately predicting electromagnetic observables, such as moments and transition rates, is essential for a comprehensive understanding of nuclear properties. However, computational limitations and conceptual difficulties often hinder the precise calculation of these observables. In this work, we extend machine learning methods for model-space extrapolations to electric quadrupole moments. We further present a new machine learning approach that leverages the correlations between energies, radii, and electromagnetic observables. By learning these correlations from no-core shell model calculations in accessible model spaces, this new model enables the prediction of converged electromagnetic observables from predictions of converged energies and radii, which can be obtained with established machine learning extrapolation tools. An essential property of our approach is the capability for uncertainty quantification, allowing for reliable predictions with combined statistical error estimates for many-body and interaction uncertainties. Being solely built upon the physical correlations of different observables, it can be generalized across different ab initio methods. We demonstrate the power of this new extrapolation scheme through a precision study of electric quadrupole moments across a wide range of p-shell nuclei.</description>

Abstract: We present a comparison of model-space extrapolation methods for No-Core Shell Model calculations of ground-state energies and root-mean-square radii in Li isotopes. In particular, we benchmark the latest machine learning tools against widely used exponential and infrared extrapolations for energies and crossing point estimates for radii. Our findings demonstrate that machine learning-based approaches provide reliable predictions with robust statistical uncertainties for both observables even in small model spaces. These predictions are compatible with established exponential and IR extrapolations of energies and mark a notable improvement over conventional radius estimates.</description>

      <title>Initial Baryon Stopping and Angular Momentum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noncentral heavy-ion collisions create fireballs with large initial orbital angular momentum that is expected to induce strong vorticity in the hot bulk fluid and generate global spin polarization of the produced particles. As the collision beam energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ decreases to approach the two-nucleon-mass threshold, this initial angular momentum approaches zero. One may thus expect that the observed global spin polarization should reach a maximum and then drop to zero as increased stopping competes with decreased initial momentum. Recent experimental measurements, however, appear to show a continual rise of hyperon polarization even down to $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =$ 2.42 GeV, suggesting a peak very near threshold which is difficult to interpret and calls for a better understanding of angular momentum initial conditions, especially at low energy. Here, we develop a new Glauber-based initial state model ("Glauber+") to investigate the initial distribution of angular momentum with respect to rapidity as well as the dependence of this distribution on initial baryon stopping across a wide range of collisional beam energy. We estimate that the angular momentum per produced final charged particle at mid-rapidity peaks around 5 GeV, which may present a potential challenge to an interpretation of the spin polarization measurements near threshold as being a consequence of the initial angular momentum of the colliding system.</description>

      <title>Modeling Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays propagation using the input from Configuration Interaction Shell Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dipole response of a nuclear system, characterized by its photon strength function (PSF), is a key ingredient of many applications of nuclear structure, ranging from nuclear reactor design and nuclear waste transmutation to astrophysical models of nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution. While the majority of those applications require the knowledge of PSF of mid-mass and heavy nuclei, there is now renewed interest in $E1$ strength distributions of light nuclei in the framework of the PANDORA project, which aims at an understanding of the mass distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic radiation (UHECR).UHECR is of extragalactic origin and its interaction along the travel path is dominated by photoabsorption of cosmic background radiation boosted to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) energy region in the center-of-mass system. Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40. Theoretical predictions are compared to available data and to existing predictions from phenomenological and microscopic models. Finally, the impact of using of CI-SM PSF on the predicted propagation of a $^{40}$Ca UHECR source is studied.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of axial anomaly effects in hot two-color QCD: FRG approach in the linear sigma model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of hadrons in two-color quantum chromodynamics (QC$_2$D) using the functional renormalization group (FRG) method, with particular focus on modifications of the $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. The hadrons are described by a linear sigma model (LSM) based on the Pauli-G\"{u}rsey $SU(4)$ symmetry, which incorporates both low-lying $0^\pm$ mesons and diquark baryons. We find that all quartic couplings are comparably suppressed when physical values of the pion mass and decay constant are taken as inputs, for which a reasonably smooth chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature is reproduced. Consequently, mass differences among chiral partners remain small. Despite these tiny mass differences, mass degeneracies of chiral partners in the hot medium are clearly demonstrated, consistent with chiral symmetry restoration. Moreover, we find that the couplings responsible for the $U(1)$ axial anomaly are enhanced upon entering the finite temperature regime. Baryonic fluctuations also provide sizable contributions to these enhancements. Finally, the fate of the topological susceptibility in the hot QC$_2$D medium is examined.</description>

Abstract: We propose an extension of the initial condition model TRENTo for sampling the number of partons inside the nucleons that participate in a heavy-ion collision. This sampling method is based on parton distribution functions (PDFs) and therefore has a natural dependence on the momentum transferred in the collision and the scale being probed during the collision. We examine the resulting distributions and their dependence on the momentum transfer. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity of different observables on the number of partons using the TRENTo framework and the estimators available therein for final-state observables.</description>

Abstract: We compute the twist-2 matching of the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) linearly polarized gluon parton distribution and fragmentation functions at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) in QCD, supplemented by next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) small-$x$ resummation for the gluon TMD fragmentation functions. These results provide high-precision fixed-order and resummed inputs to TMD phenomenology, and constitute essential theoretical ingredients for future studies of the spin structure and three-dimensional tomography of hadrons at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Triplet of kindred prompt-2p emitters in mass-8 proton-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A triplet of kindred prompt-2p emitters in A=8 nuclei has been demonstrated. Two of these are the ground state of 8C and its isobaric analog state in 8B, both of which are analogs of the halo or thick-skinned nucleus 8He. The third member is the recently found fourth 1+ state in 8B. This new 8B state at E*=8.4 MeV was observed to decay to the ground state of 6Li by 2p emission. Momentum correlations between the decay products indicate that it is not a sequential 2p decay through a 7Be intermediate state, but indicative of prompt 2p emission with correlations similar to those of the other members of the triplet. Ab initio calculations with the symmetry-adapted nocore shell model indicate that these three states have very similar spatial wavefunctions, but with nucleons coupling to different spins, isospins, and isospin projections. The triplet of 2p emitters all have oblate shapes and by stripping two protons equatorially, decay to states which have prolate shapes.</description>
