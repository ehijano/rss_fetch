      <title>AI-Guided Quantum Material Simulator for Education. Case Example: The Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teaching and learning in advanced materials science are often limited by two barriers: the technical complexity of quantum-mechanical simulations and the lack of individualized support in inquiry-based education. Here, we introduce the Neuromorphic Materials Calculator 2025 (NMC2025), a command-line platform that integrates a conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tutor with automated simulation workflows. NMC2025 combines large language model (LLM) guidance, real-time literature feedback, and domain-specific computation to create an adaptive learning environment. The system includes modular Python components for material discovery, simulation parameter optimization, and automated input generation for Quantum ESPRESSO (QE). Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the tool enables students to carry out authentic research tasks such as identifying candidate materials for neuromorphic memristors or tuning density functional theory (DFT) inputs, while receiving context-aware explanations from the AI tutor. A case study illustrates how iterative, AI-guided refinement of hypotheses and calculations enhances both accuracy and understanding. NMC2025 fosters deeper conceptual insight, independent exploration, and smooth transfer of research methods into the classroom. This approach highlights the potential of AI-augmented education to reduce barriers to complex simulations and to expand access to computational modeling across science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</description>

      <title>Female Student Population at Kabul University Before the 2021 Ban: Trends, Gender Parity, and Faculty-Level Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly two decades after 2001, Afghanistan's higher education sector expanded rapidly, with Kabul University serving as a central site of women's academic participation. Drawing on administrative records of student populations from 2016-2019 (Islamic calendar 1395-1398), this study examines gender distributions across shifts, faculties, and departments, with particular attention to STEM versus non-STEM fields. At Kabul University, the morning shift refers to the main daytime cohort (including some midday classes), while the evening shift is a separate program with its own classes and students; the two cohorts are administratively and academically distinct. Results show steady growth in the overall female student population, but with marked disparities between morning and evening shifts. Women were concentrated in non-STEM and "socially acceptable" disciplines such as literature, law, and psychology, while within STEM they were relatively well represented in the life sciences but remained significantly underrepresented in technical fields such as engineering, computer science, and physics. Gender parity improved modestly across most faculties, yet the Gender Parity Index (GPI) rarely approached 1.0, and the STEM GPI consistently remained below 0.5. These findings highlight both progress and persistent structural inequalities, documenting a critical historical benchmark before the 2021 ban on women's university education.</description>
