      <title>Mechanics of three-dimensional micro-architected interpenetrating phase composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite materials are used across engineering applications for their superior mechanical performance, a result of efficient load transfer between the structure and matrix phases. However, the inherently two-dimensional structure of laminated composites reduces their robustness to shear and out-of-plane loads, while unpredictable interlaminar failure and fiber pull-out can cause a catastrophic loss of load capacity. Meanwhile, advances toward uncovering structure-property relations in architected materials have led to highly tunable mechanical properties, deformation, and even failure. Some of these architected materials have reached near-theoretical limits; however, the majority of current work focuses on describing the response of a single-material network in air, and the effect of adding a load-bearing second phase to a three-dimensional architecture is not well understood. Here, we develop facile fabrication methods for realizing centimeter-scale polymer- and carbon-based architected interpenetrating phase composite (IPC) materials, i.e., two-phase materials consisting of a continuous 3D architecture surrounded by a load-bearing matrix across length scales, and determine the effect of geometry and constituent material properties on the mechanics of these architected IPCs. Using these experiments together with computational models, we show that the matrix phase distributes stress effectively, resulting in a high-strength, stable response. Notably, failure delocalization enhances energy dissipation of the composite, achieving specific energy absorption (SEA) values comparable to those of wound fiber tubes. Finally, we demonstrate that the stress state in an IPC can be tuned using geometric design and introduce an example in an architected composite. Altogether, this work bridges the gap between mechanically efficient composites and tunable architected materials.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Anti-chemotactic Flocking in Active Biomimetic Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competition for resources is a fundamental constraint that guides the self-organization of natural, biological, and human systems, ranging from urban planning and ecosystem development to intracellular pattern formation. Here, we reveal that competition for resources is at the origin of the collective dynamics that emerge in a population of colloids propelled by actin treadmilling, an out-of-equilibrium process where filaments grow from one end while shrinking from the other. Using a combination of experiments and theory, we show that symmetry-breaking, self-propulsion, and flocking emerge from the local competition for actin monomers. We demonstrate that beads propelled by actin treadmilling are anti-chemotactic and spontaneously generate asymmetric actin gradients that trigger and sustain directed motility. Flocking emerges from the combined effects of anti-chemotaxis and local competition for monomers. The flocking transition depends on the actin polymerization rate, actin monomer diffusivity, and the bead's motility, whose interplay controls the emergence of short-range attractive interactions between the colloids. Our findings demonstrate that active stress generation coupled to reaction-diffusion is a generic mechanism that can lead to a multiscale cascade of behaviors when active agents remodel their environment. Actin treadmilling offers a platform to study how motile agents that interact through a field self-organize in novel dynamical phases, with potential applications in non-reciprocal and trainable active matter.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale Modeling of Polymer Topology Impact on Extrudability through Molecular Dynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how polymer topology influences melt extrudability is critical for advancing material design in extrusion-based additive manufacturing. In this work, we develop a bottom-up, cross-scale modeling framework that integrates coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and continuum-scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to quantitatively assess the effects of polymer architecture on extrudability A range of branched polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymers are systematically designed by varying backbone length, sidechain length, grafting density, grafted block ratio, and periodicity of grafted-ungrafted segments. CGMD simulations are used to compute zero-shear viscosity and relaxation times, which are then incorporated into the Phan-Thien-Tanner (PTT) model within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict pressure drop of PDMS during extrusion through printer nozzle. Qualitative analysis reveals that polymers with concentrated grafted blocks exhibit significantly higher zero-shear viscosity than stochastically branched analogs, while sidechain inertia drives longer relaxation time. However, for untangled and weakly entangled PDMS, relaxation time remains in the nanosecond range, making shear-thinning and elastic effects negligible. Consequently, zero-shear viscosity emerges as the primary determinant of extrudability. This cross-scale modeling strategy provides a predictive framework for guiding the rational design of extrudable polymer materials with tailored topologies.</description>

      <title>The Discovery Engine: A Framework for AI-Driven Synthesis and Navigation of Scientific Knowledge Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevailing model for disseminating scientific knowledge relies on individual publications dispersed across numerous journals and archives. This legacy system is ill suited to the recent exponential proliferation of publications, contributing to insurmountable information overload, issues surrounding reproducibility and retractions. We introduce the Discovery Engine, a framework to address these challenges by transforming an array of disconnected literature into a unified, computationally tractable representation of a scientific domain. Central to our approach is the LLM-driven distillation of publications into structured "knowledge artifacts," instances of a universal conceptual schema, complete with verifiable links to source evidence. These artifacts are then encoded into a high-dimensional Conceptual Tensor. This tensor serves as the primary, compressed representation of the synthesized field, where its labeled modes index scientific components (concepts, methods, parameters, relations) and its entries quantify their interdependencies. The Discovery Engine allows dynamic "unrolling" of this tensor into human-interpretable views, such as explicit knowledge graphs (the CNM graph) or semantic vector spaces, for targeted exploration. Crucially, AI agents operate directly on the graph using abstract mathematical and learned operations to navigate the knowledge landscape, identify non-obvious connections, pinpoint gaps, and assist researchers in generating novel knowledge artifacts (hypotheses, designs). By converting literature into a structured tensor and enabling agent-based interaction with this compact representation, the Discovery Engine offers a new paradigm for AI-augmented scientific inquiry and accelerated discovery.</description>

      <title>Activity-enhanced shear thinning of flexible linear polar polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rheological properties of tangentially propelled flexible polymers under linear shear flow are studied by computer simulations and are compared with analytical calculations. We find a significant impact of the coupled nonequilibrium active and shear forces on the polymer characteristics. The polar activity enhances shear-induced stretching along the flow direction, shrinkage in the transverse direction, and implies a strongly amplified shear-thinning behavior. The characteristic shear rate for the onset of these effects is determined by the activity. In the asymptotic limit of large activities, the shear-induced features become independent of activity, and for asymptotically large shear rates, shear dominates over activity with passive polymer behavior.</description>

      <title>Global optimisation of the control strategy of a Brownian information Engine: Efficient information-energy exchange in a generalised potential energy surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An information engine harnesses energy from a single heat bath, utilising the gathered information. This study explores the best control strategy of a Brownian information engine (BIE), confined in a potential energy surface (PES) of arbitrary shape, and experiencing a measurement outcome-based feedback cycle. The feedback site corresponds to an instantaneous shift in the potential centre to an additional feedback distance over the measurement outcome. The strategy for the most efficient information-to-energy conversion is achieved when the position of the global potential minimum corresponds to the additional feedback distance. The BIE acts as a heater if and only if the average potential energy is higher than the energy at the additional feedback distance. Operating under confinement PES of different shapes, the BIE can harness energy beyond the average potential energy, and multiple heater-refrigerator re-entrance events are feasible. The consequences of the best control strategy are explained using sufficient examples.</description>

      <title>Patterns with long and short-range order in monoloyers of binary mixtures with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lateral microsegregation in a monolayer of a binary mixture of particles or macromolecules is studied by MD simulations in a generic model with the interacting potentials inspired by effective interactions in biological or soft-matter systems. In the model, the energy is minimized when like particles form small clusters, and the cross-interction is of opposite sign.
  We show that the laterally microsegregated components in the dense ordered phases form alternating stripes for similar densities, or the clusters of the minority component fill the hexagonally distributed voids formed in the dense phase of the majority component. A qualitative phase diagram in the plane of densities of the two components is constructed for low temperatures. An addition of the second component significantly enlarges the temperature range of the stability of the ordered phases compared to the stability of these phases in the one-component system. At higher temperatures, the disordered phase consisting of individual particles, one-component clusters and two-component super-clusters of various sizes is stable. The product kn(k), with n(k) denoting the average number of super-clusters composed of k particles, decays exponentially with k, and the inverse decay rate depends linearly on temperature.</description>

      <title>Star-like thermoresponsive microgels: a new class of soft nanocolloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide experimental and numerical evidence of a new class of soft nanocolloids: star-like microgels with thermoresponsive character. This is achieved by using the standard precipitation polymerization synthesis of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels and replacing the usually employed crosslinking agent, N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BIS), with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). The fast reactivity of EGDMA combined with its strong tendency to self-bind produces colloidal networks with a central, crosslinker-rich core, surrounded by a corona of long, crosslinker-free arms. These novel star-like microgels fully retain PNIPAM thermoresponsivity and undergo a volume phase transition at a temperature of 32{\deg}C that is very sharp as compared to standard PNIPAM-BIS microgels, independently of crosslinker content. Dynamic light scattering and small angle X-ray scattering experiments are compared to extensive simulation results, based on ideal star polymers as well as on state-of-the-art monomer-resolved simulations, offering a microscopic evidence of the star-like internal structure of PNIPAM-EGDMA microgels. This can be described by a novel model for the form factors combining star and microgel features. The present work thus bridges the fields of star polymers and microgels, providing the former with the ability to respond to temperature via a facile synthetic route that can be routinely employed, opening the way to exploit these soft particles for a variety of fundamental studies and applicative purposes.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the dispersion of active suspensions with oscillatory flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined impact of axial stretching and cross-stream diffusion on the downstream transport of solute is termed Taylor dispersion. The dispersion of active suspensions is qualitatively distinct: viscous and external torques can establish non-uniform concentration fields with weighted access to shear, modifying mean drift and effective diffusivity. It would be advantageous to fine-tune the dispersion for systems such as bioreactors, where mixing or particle separation can improve efficacy. Here, we investigate the dispersion of active suspensions in a vertical channel driven by an oscillatory pressure gradient - Womersley flow - using gyrotactic swimmers (bottom-heavy cells subject to viscous torques). Preliminary experimental results reveal interesting dispersion phenomena, highly dependent on the oscillation parameters, motivating theoretical investigation. Employing Lagrangian simulations, we find that oscillatory flows can induce drift and increase lateral and downstream dispersion, with periodic mixing between left and right sides. Such flows can also be used to separate species with different motile behaviour. Eulerian numerical schemes typically require an approach to averaging in orientational space, such as generalised Taylor dispersion, with assumptions on translational and rotational time scales. For an oscillatory timescale commensurate with cell dynamics, we reveal the limitations of such approximations, beyond which the averaging techniques collapse.</description>

      <title>Recovering Hidden Degrees of Freedom Using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian Processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions--such as the Mat\'ern kernel--directly impose impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. The resulting embedding features enhance metastability, facilitating the construction of Markov state models with smaller lag times and better convergence of implied timescales. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables may fail to capture the full dynamical picture.</description>

      <title>Rotational Multi-material 3D Printing of Soft Robotic Matter with Asymmetrical Embedded Pneumatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid design and fabrication of soft robotic matter is of growing interest for shape morphing, actuation, and wearable devices. Here, we report a facile fabrication method for creating soft robotic materials with embedded pneumatics that exhibit programmable shape morphing behavior. Using rotational multi-material 3D printing, asymmetrical core-shell filaments composed of elastomeric shells and fugitive cores are patterned in 1D and 2D motifs. By precisely controlling the nozzle design, rotation rate, and print path, one can control the local orientation, shape, and cross-sectional area of the patterned fugitive core along each printed filament. Once the elastomeric matrix is cured, the fugitive cores are removed, leaving behind embedded conduits that facilitate pneumatic actuation. Using a connected Fermat spirals pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths required for more complex soft robots, such as hand-inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Heat Engine Using a Single Brownian Ellipsoid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers can confine position as well as orientation of a Brownian particle by simultaneously exerting restoring force and torque on it. Here we have proposed the theoretical model of a microscopic Stirling engine, using a passive Brownian ellipsoid as its working substance. The position and the orientation degrees of freedom (DoF) of the ellipsoid in two dimensions (2D), both being confined harmonically by the tweezers, are coupled to a hot and a cold thermal bath time-periodically. The stiffness of the force confinement is also time-periodic such that it resembles a piston-like protocol which drives the Brownian ellipsoid through the strokes of a Stirling cycle. The ellipsoid takes heat from the hot bath and partially converts it into useful thermodynamic work. The extracted work and input heat shows explicit dependence on the shape of the working substance as well as its orientational bias. The operational characteristics of the anisotropic Stirling engine is analyzed using the variance in work and efficiency (in the quasi-static regime), where the latter is bounded by both the Carnot limit as well as the isotropic benchmark. Several ways have been proposed to yield maximum efficiency at a minimum fluctuation in the output. The dissipative coupling between the position and orientation of the ellipsoid, that arises due to its spherical-asymmetry (or, shape anisotropy) and a finite mean orientation, plays an important role to optimize the engine characteristics. Finally, we have analytically explored the slightly anisotropic regime, where the coupling is linearized by suitably tuning the system parameters. The average extracted work has also been calculated in this case, which shows an excellent agreement with the numerical results of the fully anisotropic system, when subjected to the stipulated range of parameters.</description>

      <title>A Magnetic-like description of Oscillatory Behavior in Chemotactic Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of chemotaxis in the movement dynamics of Aphaenogaster Senilis ants. To do so, we design an experimental setup in which individual ants are exposed to a narrow pheromone trail to guide their motion. As expected, ants locate and navigate the trail by detecting chemical scents, exhibiting a characteristic zigzag pattern, moving at a nearly constant speed while oscillating perpendicularly to the trail. The zigzagging motion is common across many species yet its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we propose a physical framework based on the Inertial Spin Model as an approach to quantitatively describe and explain this behavior. So, we implement chemotaxis resembling magnetic-like interactions between the ant's velocity and the pheromone gradient. Under specific approximations, the model yields an analytical expression for the velocity correlations perpendicular to the trail, predicting a characteristic oscillatory decay. This prediction closely matches our experimental data, suggesting that the model captures the essential ingredients of ant dynamics. By fitting the model parameters to individual experimental trajectories, we further explore their potential biological significance and validate our assumptions. Overall, our findings contribute to the understanding of chemotaxis in ant motion and its physical features.</description>

Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks have a self-healing property where networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, both the mechanisms and dynamics of healing remain largely unknown. Here we report a healing mechanism in microtubule-motor networks by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-heal. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to heal cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of a boundary layer where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby heal the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is found to be tunable by the network geometry.</description>

      <title>Acoustic signaling enables collective perception and control in active matter systems</title>

Abstract: Emergent cooperative functionality in active matter systems plays a crucial role in various applications of active swarms, ranging from pollutant foraging and collective threat detection to tissue embolization. In nature, animals like bats and whales use acoustic signals to communicate and enhance their evolutionary competitiveness. Here, we show that information exchange by acoustic waves between active agents creates a large variety of multifunctional structures. In our realization of collective swarms, each unit is equipped with an acoustic emitter and a detector. The swarmers respond to the resulting acoustic field by adjusting their emission frequency and migrating toward the strongest signal. We find self-organized structures with different morphology, including snake-like self-propelled entities, localized aggregates, and spinning rings. These collective swarms exhibit emergent functionalities, such as phenotype robustness, collective decision-making, and environmental sensing. For instance, the collectives show self-regeneration after strong distortion, allowing them to penetrate through narrow constrictions. Additionally, they exhibit a population-scale perception of reflecting objects and a collective response to acoustic control inputs. Our results provide insights into fundamental organization mechanisms in information-exchanging swarms. They may inspire design principles for technical implementations in the form of acoustically or electromagnetically communicating microrobotic swarms capable of performing complex tasks and concerting collective responses to external cues.</description>

      <title>The electrostatic charge on exuded liquid drops</title>

Abstract: Fluid triboelectrification, also known as flow electrification, remains an under-explored yet ubiquitous phenomenon with potential applications from material science to planetary evolution. Building upon previous efforts to position water within the triboelectric series, we investigate the charge on individual, millimetric water drops falling through air. Our experiments measured the charge and mass of each drop using a Faraday cup mounted on a mass balance, and connected to an electrometer. For pure water in a glass syringe with a grounded metal tip, we find the charge per drop ($\Delta q/\Delta m$) was approximately -5 pC/g to -1 pC/g. This was independent of the release height of the drop, tip diameter and length, tip cleaning preparation, and whether the experiment was shielded with a Faraday cage. Biasing the tip to different voltages allowed for linear control of the drop charge, and the results were consistent with known electrochemical effects, namely the Volta potential expected between most metals and bulk water ($\approx$ -0.5 V). Introducing insulating plastic materials into the experiment (from the syringe body or tip) imparted large amounts of charge on the drops with systematic charge evolution. Together these results show that the flow electrification of water is more complex than previously reported, and is driven by material-dependent electrostatic processes.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Soft Matter: Towards Embodied Intelligence</title>

Abstract: Intelligent soft matter stands at the intersection of materials science, physics, and cognitive science, promising to change how we design and interact with materials. This transformative field seeks to create materials that possess life-like capabilities, such as perception, learning, memory, and adaptive behavior. Unlike traditional materials, which typically perform static or predefined functions, intelligent soft matter dynamically interacts with its environment. It integrates multiple sensory inputs, retains experiences, and makes decisions to optimize its responses. Inspired by biological systems, these materials intend to leverage the inherent properties of soft matter: flexibility, self-evolving, and responsiveness to perform functions that mimic cognitive processes. By synthesizing current research trends and projecting their evolution, we present a forward-looking perspective on how intelligent soft matter could be constructed, with the aim of inspiring innovations in fields such as biomedical devices, adaptive robotics, and beyond. We highlight new pathways for integrating design of sensing, memory and action with internal low-power operations and discuss challenges for practical implementation of materials with "intelligent behavior". These approaches outline a path towards to more robust, versatile and scalable materials that can potentially act, compute, and "think" by their inherent intrinsic material behaviour beyond traditional smart technologies relying on external control.</description>

      <title>State Diagram of the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model and the Effects of Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Interactions between active particles may be non-reciprocal, breaking action-reaction symmetry and leading to novel physics not seen in equilibrium systems. In this work, we study the state diagram for the non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model with different types of symmetry -- discrete and continuous -- and examine the effects of non-reciprocity on phase separation. The models are analyzed by drawing the full linear stability diagrams, indicating the onset of phase separation, allowing us to demonstrate how non-reciprocity gives rise to out-of-equilibrium steady states with non-zero currents. These observations remain valid in a large part of parameter space, and with the addition of weak noise. By describing the effects of symmetry on conserved, non-reciprocal models, this work adds to our understanding of the rich behavior of such models.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Impact of Cholesterol on Ionic Liquid-Membrane Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role of cholesterol in ionic liquid (IL)-membrane interactions is essential for advancing biomedical applications of ILs, including the development of innovative antimicrobial agents. In this study, we explore the intricate and multifaceted role of cholesterol in modulating IL-membrane interactions, employing a comprehensive suite of biophysical techniques. We systematically examine how IL alkyl chain length and membrane physical state influence the impact of cholesterol on IL-lipid membrane interaction. The incorporation of ILs is shown to increase the area per lipid in both pristine dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and DPPC-cholesterol membranes. Cholesterol modulates the impact of ILs on lipid conformation, membrane viscoelasticity, and phase behavior. Small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering measurements reveal that cholesterol mitigates IL-induced structural perturbations in vesicles. Our isothermal titration calorimetry measurements reveal that the presence of cholesterol significantly weakens the binding of ILs to membranes. Intriguingly, despite this reduced binding affinity, cholesterol-containing membranes demonstrate enhanced permeabilization. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to cholesterol's ordering of lipid membranes, which increases susceptibility to stress and defects. Our results underscore the complex and non-universal interplay between lipid composition, IL alkyl chain length, and membrane phase state. These insights provide a deeper understanding of cholesterol's role in IL-membrane interactions, paving the way for the design of advanced applications of ILs in antimicrobial therapy and drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Stochastic Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting at the mesoscopic level with a general formulation of stochastic thermodynamics in terms of Markov jump processes, we identify the scaling conditions that ensure the emergence of a (typically nonlinear) deterministic dynamics and an extensive thermodynamics at the macroscopic level. We then use large deviations theory to build a macroscopic fluctuation theory around this deterministic behavior, which we show preserves the fluctuation theorem. For many systems (e.g. chemical reaction networks, electronic circuits, Potts models), this theory does not coincide with Langevin-equation approaches (obtained by adding Gaussian white noise to the deterministic dynamics) which, if used, are thermodynamically inconsistent. Einstein-Onsager theory of Gaussian fluctuations and irreversible thermodynamics are recovered at equilibrium and close to it, respectively. Far from equilibirum, the free energy is replaced by the dynamically generated quasi-potential (or self-information) which is a Lyapunov function for the macroscopic dynamics. Remarkably, thermodynamics connects the dissipation along deterministic and escape trajectories to the Freidlin-Wentzell quasi-potential, thus constraining the transition rates between attractors induced by rare fluctuations. A coherent perspective on minimum and maximum entropy production principles is also provided. For systems that admit a continuous-space limit, we derive a nonequilibrium fluctuating field theory with its associated thermodynamics. Finally, we coarse grain the macroscopic stochastic dynamics into a Markov jump process describing transitions among deterministic attractors and formulate the stochastic thermodynamics emerging from it.</description>

      <title>Material properties of biomolecular condensates emerge from nanoscale dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity reduces the droplet size in mucosalivary film fragmentation during intense respiratory events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental fluid dynamical mechanisms dictating the generation of bioaerosols in the human trachea during intense respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, with an emphasis on the role played by the mucosalivary fluid viscoelasticity. An experimental investigation of the shear-induced fragmentation of a mucosalivary-mimetic fluid in a confined geometry reveals that viscoelastic liquids undergo atomization in a manner akin to Newtonian liquids -- via the formation of bag-like structures -- which ultimately rupture through the appearance of retracting holes on the bag surface. Droplets are produced via the unstable retraction of liquid rims bounding these holes. However, in comparison to Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic bags inflate to larger sizes -- implying thinner sheets and, consequently smaller droplets upon rupture. Numerical simulations support that the smaller droplets can be attributed to the thinner sheets, with a more uniform thickness, for viscoelastic bags prior to rupture. Hence, we highlight the role of the viscoelasticity in determining the thickness of the intermediate bag-like structures, which, in turn, govern the droplet size distribution of the expelled aerosol.</description>
