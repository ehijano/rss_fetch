      <title>Jamming of Elastoviscoplastic fluids in Elastic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluid flows are driven by a non-trivial interplay between the elastic, viscous, and plastic properties, which under certain conditions can transition the otherwise laminar flow into complex flow instabilities with rich space-time-dependent dynamics. We discover that under elastic turbulence regimes, EVP fluids undergo dynamic jamming triggered by localised polymer stress deformations that facilitate the formation of solid regions trapped in local low-stress energy wells. Below the jamming transition $\phi&lt;\phi_J$, the solid volume fraction $\phi$ scales with $\sqrt{Bi}$, where $Bi$ is the Bingham number characterizing the ratio of yield to viscous stresses, in direct agreement with theoretical approximations based on the laminar solution. The onset of this new dynamic jamming transition $\phi\geq\phi_J$ is marked by a clear deviation from the scaling $\phi \sim \sqrt{Bi}$, scaling as $\phi \sim \exp{Bi}$. We show that this instability-induced jamming transition -- analogous to that in dense suspensions -- leads to slow, minimally diffusive, and rigid-like flows with finite deformability, highlighting a novel phase-change in elastic turbulence regimes of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Classification of Supercooled Liquids: Critical Cooling Rates and Entropic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically investigate supercooled liquids formed at cooling rates below and above the critical cooling rate (CCR). By analyzing the distribution of short-time averaged potential energies (DoPE) and crystallization behaviors, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes in supercooled liquids: the glass-forming regime (GFR) and the crystal-forming regime (CFR). For systems cooled below CCR (CFR), the DoPE exhibits a sharp peak, indicative of reduced configurational entropy. In contrast, liquids cooled above CCR (GFR) display a broad DoPE distribution, reflecting higher configurational entropy. These findings establish a robust classification framework for supercooled liquids. Further analysis reveals a crossover temperature (T_x) in both regimes, consistent with the freezing temperature (T_f). Near T_x, crystallization barrier-temperature relationships exhibit abrupt changes. Below T_x, CFR crystallizes marginally faster than GFR, whereas above T_x, the influence of cooling rates on crystallization rates diminishes. These results further categorize GFR and CFR into high and low-temperature sub-regimes, highlighting the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Swelling Kinetics of pNIPAM Lyogels: The Role of Crosslinking, Copolymerization, and Solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimuli-responsive lyogels are known for their ability to undergo significant macroscopic changes when exposed to external stimuli. While thermo-responsive gels, such as poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), have been extensively studied across various applications, solvent-induced swelling has predominantly been investigated in aqueous solutions. This study explores the tailoring of lyogel formulations for future applications by controlling their solvent-induced swelling behavior, comparing both homopolymeric and semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs). For the first time, the impact of chemical and physical crosslinking, as well as copolymer inclusion, on the swelling behavior and mechanical properties of lyogels in organic solvents is examined and compared with solvent-induced swelling kinetics measurements. The results demonstrate that increasing chemically crosslinking in homopolymers and physically crosslinking in semi-IPNs enhances mechanical stability, while improving mass transport properties and solvent exchange kinetics. However, an increase in crosslinking results in a prolonged response time and a reduction in the overall swelling capacity of the lyogels. Furthermore, variations in solvent properties, including molecular size and diffusion rates, significantly influence the swelling kinetics, whereas smaller, faster-diffusing solvents leading to more pronounced solvent spillage effects. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between gel formulation, network structure, and solvent nature in determining the solvent-induced swelling kinetics of lyogels, providing insights into how these materials can be tailored for specific applications especially those requiring short response times and optimized mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Capillary-driven thinning of DNA solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillary thinning of polymeric fluids is central to biological and industrial processes, yet the mechanisms governing thinning dynamics remain unresolved, especially for semi-flexible polymers. Using ideal solutions of semi-flexible DNA, we validate a predictive model for exponential capillary thinning that accounts for each polymer in the molecular weight distribution. For semi-flexible polymers, self-selection of the exponential time constant occurs by a fundamentally different mechanism than for highly flexible systems, and is not simply governed by the longest polymer relaxation time.</description>

      <title>In situ vs ex situ: Comparing the structure of PNIPAM microgels at the air/water and air/solid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the vertical and lateral structure of microgels (MGs) layers at the air/water interface and the effect of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) transfer on solid substrates on the structure. The MGs are based on poly($N$-isopropylacrylamide) networks. For studying the structure at the air/water interface specular and off-specular X-ray reflectivity (OSR/XRR) allows in situ measurements without any labelling techniques. The initial ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) scans of LB-transferred MGs at the air/solid interface reveal strong lateral 2D hexagonal ordering across a broad range of lateral surface pressures at the air/water interface before LB-transfer. Notably, for the first time, these results were confirmed by OSR, demonstrating the existence of the long-range hexagonal ordering at low and intermediate surface pressures. For in situ conditions and upon uniaxial compression at the air/water interface, the MG lattice constant decreases non-monotonically. This indicates the formation of domains at low pressures, that approach each other and only compress when the surface isotherm reaches a plateau. Comparing results of in situ and ex situ measurements, our study clearly shows a transfer effect during the LB-deposition on the lateral ordering of the MGs: The distance between the particles decrease during LB-transfer and at high pressures ($\Pi\,&gt;\,22\,\mathrm{mNm^{-1}}$) a second distance occurs indicating small domains with hexagonal internal ordering. The novel surface characterisation approaches here highlight the use of both XRR and OSR to probe the vertical and lateral structure of adsorbed MGs, offering in situ, non-invasive insights without the need for doping or transfer-induced artefacts.</description>

      <title>A novel method for quantifying enzyme immobilization in porous carriers using simple NMR relaxometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enzyme immobilization plays a crucial role in enhancing the stability and recyclability of enzymes for industrial applications. However, traditional methods for quantifying enzyme loading within porous carriers are limited by time-consuming workflows, cumulative errors, and the inability to probe enzymes adsorbed inside the pores. In this study, we introduce Time-Domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (TD-NMR) relaxometry as a novel, non-invasive technique for directly quantifying enzyme adsorption within porous carriers. Focusing on epoxy methyl acrylate carriers, commonly used in biocatalysis, we correlate changes in T2 relaxation times with enzyme concentration, leading to the development of an NMR-based pore-filling ratio that quantifies enzyme loading. Validation experiments demonstrate that TD-NMR-derived adsorption curves align closely with traditional photometric measurements, offering a reliable and reproducible alternative for enzyme quantification. The accessibility of tabletop TD-NMR spectrometers makes this technique a practical and cost-effective tool for optimizing biocatalytic processes. Furthermore, the method holds promise for real-time monitoring of adsorption dynamics and could be adapted for a wider range of carrier materials and enzymes.</description>

      <title>Odd electrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions in elastic media give rise to rich non-equilibrium behaviors, but controllable experimental realizations of such odd elastic phenomena remain scarce. Building on recent breakthroughs in electrical analogs of non-Hermitian solid-state systems, we design and analyze scalable odd electrical circuits (OECs) as exact analogs of an odd solid. We show that electrical work can be extracted from OECs via cyclic excitations and trace the apparent energy gain back to active circuit elements. We show that OECs host oscillatory modes that resemble recent experimental observations in living chiral crystals and identify active resonances that reveal a perspective on odd elasticity as a mechanism for mechanical amplification.</description>

      <title>Eph-ephrin-mediated differential persistence as a mechanism for cell sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.</description>

      <title>Carbonic anhydrase II simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carbonic anhydrase II enzyme (CA II) is one of the most significant enzymes in nature, reversibly converting CO$_2$ to bicarbonate at a remarkable rate. The precise mechanism it uses to achieve this rapid turnover remains unclear due to our inability to directly observe or simulate the full process dynamically. Here, we use a recently developed universal neural network potential (Orb) to simulate the active site of CA II. We reproduce several known features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that conducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we observe a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the active site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs from the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide. Existing experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are used to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the potential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important molecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$ capture technologies and drug design.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Integrated Modeling of Thermal Properties and Relaxation Dynamics in Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metallic glasses are a promising class of materials celebrated for their exceptional thermal and mechanical properties. However, accurately predicting and understanding the melting temperature (T_m) and glass transition temperature (T_g) remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach that integrates machine learning (ML) models with theoretical methods to predict and analyze these key thermal properties in metallic glasses. Our ML models using distributional data derived from elemental composition-based features obtain high accuracy while minimizing data preprocessing complexity. Furthermore, we explore the correlation between T_m and T_g to elucidate their dependence on alloy composition and thermodynamic behavior. When the T_g value of metallic glasses is known, further analysis using the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) theory provides a deeper understanding of structural relaxation dynamics. This integrated framework establishes a quantitative description consistent with experimental data and previous works and paves the way for the efficient design and discovery of advanced materials with tailored thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Fluid mechanics of sarcomeres as porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muscle contraction, both in skeletal and cardiac tissue, is driven by sarcomeres, the microscopic units inside muscle cells where thick myosin and thin actin filaments slide past each other. During contraction and relaxation, the sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to flow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a quantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an anisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of thick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and lateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities of this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy model to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions of our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element simulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in one-dimensional non-reciprocal matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unveiling universal non-equilibrium scaling laws has been a central theme in modern statistical physics, with recent attention increasingly directed toward nonequilibrium phases that exhibit rich dynamical phenomena. A striking example arises in nonreciprocal systems, where asymmetric interactions between components lead to inherently dynamic phases and unconventional criticality near a critical exceptional point (CEP), where the criticality arises from the coalescence of collective modes to the Nambu-Goldstone mode. However, the universal scaling behavior that should emerge in this system with full consideration of many-body effects and stochastic noise remains largely elusive. Here, we establish a dynamical scaling law in a generic one-dimensional stochastic nonreciprocal $O(2)$-symmetric system. Through large-scale simulations, we uncover a new nonequilibrium scaling in the vicinity of transition, distinct from any previously known equilibrium or nonequilibrium universality classes. In regimes where the system breaks into domains with opposite chirality, we demonstrate that fluctuations are strongly suppressed, leading to a logarithmic scaling as a function of system size $L$, in contrast to the conventional power-law scaling expected from dynamical scaling theory. This work elucidates the beyond-mean-field dynamics of non-reciprocal matter, thereby sheding light on the exploration of criticality in nonreciprocal phase transition across diverse physical contexts, from active matter and driven quantum systems to biological pattern formation and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a configuration of a smectic liquid crystal, we show that a new screw dislocation loop can be introduced along any knot or link transverse to the regular layers through a purely local modification. We define a topological invariant of screw dislocation loops, the multiplicity, and show that it can be explicitly prescribed in our construction. Finally, we apply this method to establish that any link type can be locally introduced within the set of screw dislocations of a smectic configuration modeled by an open book decomposition.</description>

      <title>Inescapable anisotropy of non-reciprocal XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate non-reciprocal XY (NRXY) models defined on two-dimensional lattices in which the coupling strength of a spin with its neighbors varies with their position in the frame defined by the current spin orientation. As expected from the seminal work of Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020), we first show that non-reciprocity is akin to a self-propulsion: we derive a mean-field continuous theory identical to that of constant-density flocks. Like the latter, NRXY models exhibit a long-range ordered phase that is metastable to the nucleation of topological defects, and their asymptotic state is a dynamic foam of asters. We then show that in the metastable ordered phase, the lattice always induces anisotropy on large scales, pinning the direction of order and imposing a finite correlation length. Crucially, we demonstrate that this anisotropy is inescapable since, even when not explicitly present in the model, it is generated by fluctuations. In short, the ordered phase of lattice NRXY models is that of active clock models.</description>

Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Interactions Reshape Topological Defect Annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how non-reciprocal ferromagnetic interactions between neighbouring planar spins in two dimensions, affect the behaviour of topological defects. Non-reciprocity is introduced by weighting the coupling strength of the two-dimensional XY model by an anisotropic kernel. As a consequence, in addition to the topological charge $q$, the actual shape of the defects becomes crucial to faithfully describe their dynamics. Non-reciprocal coupling twists the spin field, selecting specific defect shapes, dramatically altering the pair annihilation process. Defect annihilation can either be enhanced or hindered, depending on the shape of the defects concerned and the degree of non-reciprocity in the system. We introduce a continuous description -- for which the phenomenological coefficients can be explicitly written in terms of the microscopic ones -- that captures the behaviour of the lattice model.</description>
