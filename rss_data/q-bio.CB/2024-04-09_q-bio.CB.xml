      <title>Does nematic order allow groups of elongated cells to sense electric fields better?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective response to external directional cues like electric fields plays a pivotal role in processes such as tissue development, regeneration, and wound healing. In this study we focus on the impact of anisotropy in cell shape and local cell alignment on the collective response to electric fields. We model elongated cells that have a different accuracy sensing the field depending on their orientation with respect to the field. Elongated cells often line up with their long axes in the same direction - "nematic order" - does this help the group of cells sense the field more accurately? We use simulations of a simple model to show that if cells orient themselves perpendicular to their average velocity, alignment of a cell's long axis to its nearest neighbors' orientation can enhance the directional response to electric fields. However, for cells to benefit from aligning, their accuracy of sensing must be strongly dependent on cell orientation. We also show that cell-cell adhesion modulates the accuracy of cells in the group.</description>

      <title>Logic-dependent emergence of multistability, hysteresis, and biphasic dynamics in a minimal positive feedback network with an autoloop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cellular decision-making (CDM) is a dynamic phenomenon often controlled by regulatory networks defining interactions between genes and transcription factor proteins. Traditional studies have focussed on molecular switches such as positive feedback circuits that exhibit at most bistability. However, higher-order dynamics such as tristability is also prominent in many biological processes. It is thus imperative to identify a minimal circuit that can alone explain mono, bi, and tristable dynamics. In this work, we consider a two-component positive feedback network with an autoloop and explore these regimes of stability for different degrees of multimerization and the choice of Boolean logic functions. We report that this network can exhibit numerous dynamical scenarios such as bi-and tristability, hysteresis, and biphasic kinetics, explaining the possibilities of abrupt cell state transitions and the smooth state swap without a step-like switch. Specifically, while with monomeric regulation and competitive OR logic, the circuit exhibits mono-and bistability and biphasic dynamics, with non-competitive AND and OR logics only monostability can be achieved. To obtain bistability in the latter cases, we show that the autoloop must have (at least) dimeric regulation. In pursuit of higher-order stability, we show that tristability occurs with higher degrees of multimerization and with non-competitive OR logic only. Our results, backed by rigorous analytical calculations and numerical examples, thus explain the association between multistability, multimerization, and logic in this minimal circuit. Since this circuit underlies various biological processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition which often drives carcinoma metastasis, these results can thus offer crucial inputs to control cell state transition by manipulating multimerization and the logic of regulation in cells.</description>
