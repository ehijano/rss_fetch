      <title>Closed universes, factorization, and ensemble averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study closed universes in holographic theories of quantum gravity. We argue that within any fixed theory, factorization implies there is one unique closed universe state. The wave function of any state that can be prepared by the path integral is proportional to the Hartle-Hawking wave function. This unique wave function depends on the properties of the underlying holographic theory such as the energy spectrum. We show these properties explicitly in JT gravity, which is known to be dual to an ensemble of random Hamiltonians. For each member of the ensemble, the corresponding wave function is erratic as a result of the spectrum being chaotic. After ensemble averaging, we obtain smooth semi-classical wave functions as well as different closed universe states.</description>

      <title>Higher Operations in Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the role of formal deformation theory in quantum field theories and present various ``higher operations'' which control their deformations, (generalized) OPEs, and anomalies. Particular attention is paid to holomorphic-topological theories where we systematically describe and regularize the Feynman diagrams which compute these higher operations in free and perturbative scenarios, including examples with defects. We prove geometrically that the resulting higher operations satisfy expected ``quadratic axioms,'' which can be interpreted physically as a form of Wess-Zumino consistency condition for BRST symmetry. We discuss a higher-dimensional analogue of Kontsevich's formality theorem, which proves the absence of perturbative corrections in TQFTs with two or more topological directions. We discuss at some length the relation of our work to the theory of factorization algebras and provide an introduction to the subject for physicists.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various observables in different four-dimensional superconformal Yang-Mills theories can be computed exactly as Fredholm determinants of truncated Bessel operators. We exploit this relation to determine their dependence on the 't Hooft coupling constant. Unlike the weak coupling expansion, which has a finite radius of convergence, the strong coupling expansion is factorially divergent, necessitating the inclusion of nonperturbative, exponentially small corrections. We develop a method to systematically compute these corrections and discuss the resurgent properties of the resulting transseries.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Symmetries for Logarithmic Soft Theorems in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories and perturbative gravity in four dimensions are governed by a tower of infinite-dimensional symmetries which arise from tree-level soft theorems. However, aside from the leading soft theorems which are all-loop exact, subleading ones receive loop corrections due to long-range infrared effects which result in new soft theorems with logarithmic dependence on the energy of the soft particle. The conjectured universality of these logarithmic soft theorems to all loop orders cries out for a symmetry interpretation. In this letter we initiate a program to compute long-range infrared corrections to the charges that generate the asymptotic symmetries in (scalar) QED and perturbative gravity. For late-time fall-offs of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields which give rise to infrared dressings for the matter fields, we derive finite charge conservation laws and show that in the quantum theory they correspond precisely to the first among the infinite tower of logarithmic soft theorems. This symmetry interpretation, by virtue of being universal and all-loop exact, is a key element for a holographic principle in spacetimes with flat asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Criticality and thermodynamic geometry of quantum BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant acts as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume, we analyze the phase structure and thermodynamic geometry of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. Our results uncover two-phase transitions in the $T-S$ plane across all pressures except at a critical value. Numerical analysis reveals continuous critical phenomena along the coexistence curve, with critical exponents of 2 and 3 for the heat capacity at constant pressure and the NTG curvature, respectively. Importantly, these values notably deviate from the well-known critical exponents observed in mean-field Van der Waals (VdW) fluids, where the NTG curvature and heat capacity demonstrate discontinuous criticality. To our knowledge, our investigation is the first exploration of critical behavior in black holes incorporating consistent semiclassical backreaction.</description>

      <title>Bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models from Fock-space fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-AdS$_2$ dynamics arise ubiquitously near the horizon of near-extremal black holes. The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model -- a $p$-local model of fermions -- is the first microscopic model that realizes the dual near-CFT$_1$ dynamics. However, a bosonic near-CFT$_1$ model has remained elusive in the $p$-local approach because such constructions generally suffer from unwanted orderings at low temperatures. Recently, it was pointed out that such near-CFT$_1$ dynamics can quite generally arise if we place a large amount of random fluxes in a many-body Fock space and $p$-locality is not essential. We will use this insight to construct a collection of bosonic near-CFT$_1$ models with a conserved charge. One class of models we wish to highlight are based on canonical bosons with conserved occupation numbers. We further argue that such bosonic models do not suffer from energetic instablities or unwanted low-temperature orderings. Furthermore, canonical bosons allow the number densities to be arbitrarily large, which is impossible in quibt- or fermion-based constructions. This creates a larger variety of scaling regimes for the thermodynamics. For comparison we also consider a second class of charge-conserving models which are based on qubits. The thermodynamic scalings (with respect to conserved charges) of these models are very similar to those of the double-scaled complex SYK model but are free of certain singularities the latter suffers from, even though both are solved by chord diagrams. We also show the level statistics for both models are described by random matrix theory universality down to very low energy.</description>

      <title>Loops in Anti de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss general one and two-loops banana diagrams with arbitrary masses on the anti de Sitter spacetime by using direct methods of AdS quantum field theory in the dimensional regularization approach. In the one-loop case we also compute the effective potential for an $O(N)$ model in dimension $d=4$ as an explicit function of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, both exactly and perturbatively up to order $\Lambda$. For the two-loop case we show that the calculation is made easy thanks to a remarkable discrete Kallen-Lehmann formula whose domain of applicability we generalize in the present paper.</description>

Abstract: We discuss general one and two-loops banana diagrams with arbitrary masses on the de Sitter spacetime by using direct methods of dS quantum field theory in the dimensional regularization approach. In the one-loop case we also compute the effective potential for an $O(N)$ model in $d=4$ dimension as an explicit function of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, both exactly and perturbatively up to order $\Lambda$. For the two-loop case we show that the calculation is made easy thanks to a remarkable Kallen-Lehmann formula that has been in the literature for a while. We discuss the divergent cases at d=3 using a contiguity formula for generalized hypergeometric functions and we extract the dominant term at d=4 proving a general formula to deal with a divergent hypergeometric series.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity in de Sitter space from the doubled-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter (LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions. First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on its possible dual manifestations.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild Black Hole from Perturbation Theory to all Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying the quantum field theoretic perturbiner approach to Einstein gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Approach to Time-Dependent Quantum Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently we have introduced a lightweight, perturbative approach to quantum solitons. Thus far, our approach has been largely limited to configurations consisting of a single soliton plus a finite number of mesons, whose classical limit is an isolated stationary or rigidly moving soliton. In this paper, with an eye to soliton collisions and oscillons, we generalize this approach to quantum states whose classical limits are genuinely time-dependent. More precisely, we use a unitary operator, inspired by the coherent state approach to solitons, to factor out the nonperturbative part of the state, which includes the classical motion. The solution for the quantum state and its evolution is then reduced to an entirely perturbative problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering the nonminimal coupling of dilaton field to the massive graviton field in Maxwell-dilaton-Massive gravity, we obtain a class of analytical solutions of charged black holes, which are neither asymptotically flat nor (A)dS. The calculated thermodynamic quantities, such as mass, temperature and entropy, verify the valid of first law of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, we further investigate the critical behaviors of these black holes in grand canonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively, and find that there is a new and novel critical phenomenon which is never found before, called ``reversed" reentrant phase transition with a tricritical point. It implies that the system undergoes a novel ``SBH-LBH-SBH" phase transition process, and is the reverse of the ``LBH-SBH-LBH" process observed in reentrant phase transitions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that electric fields in compactified spaces may cause breakdown of four dimensional (4D) effective description of higher-dimensional theory. We consider a charged massless complex scalar coupled to U(1) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times {\mathbb S}^1$ and discuss the effect of background gauge potential along a compact direction. The electric field produces the charged particle non-perturbatively, which we call Kaluza-Klein (KK) Schwinger effect. We quantitatively show that KK modes can be produced even when the electric field energy is much below the KK scale. The mechanism is rather general and similar phenomena would occur in any compactification models when a gauge potential along compact direction evolves in time and experiences large enough field excursion.</description>

      <title>Condensed vacuum generated by spin-spin interaction as a source of axial current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the presence of a new source of axial current due to the condensed vacuum generated
  by the spin-spin interaction. To show this, we consider a quartic Dirac Lagrangian containing a
  spin-spin interaction term, possibly originating from torsion in Einstein-Cartan-like theories. We
  use a mean field approach to analyze the quantized theory. We show that the diagonalization of the
  field Hamiltonian defines a new vacuum state, energetically favored with respect to the free vacuum.
  Such a vacuum, which is a condensate of particle-antiparticle pairs, is characterized by a nontrivial
  expectation value of the axial current operator. The new source of axial current, here obtained, can
  have effects both at the atomic level and at the astrophysical-cosmological level depending on the
  origin of the spin-spin interaction term. The condensate may affect the dark sector of the universe
  at cosmological level and the axial current originated by the vacuum condensate could be analyzed
  in next table top experiments on graphene</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos on Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the physics of many-body quantum chaotic systems close to their ground states has come under intensified scrutiny. Such studies are motivated by the emergence of model systems exhibiting chaotic fluctuations throughout the entire spectrum (the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model being a renowned representative) as well as by the physics of holographic principles, which likewise unfold close to ground states. Interpreting the edge of the spectrum as a quantum critical point, here we combine a wide range of analytical and numerical methods to the identification and comprehensive description of two different universality classes: the near edge physics of ``sparse'' and the near edge of ``dense'' chaotic systems. The distinction lies in the ratio between the number of a system's random parameters and its Hilbert space dimension, which is exponentially small or algebraically small in the sparse and dense case, respectively. Notable representatives of the two classes are generic chaotic many-body models (sparse) and single particle systems, invariant random matrix ensembles, or chaotic gravitational systems (dense). While the two families share identical spectral correlations at energy scales comparable to the level spacing, the density of states and its fluctuations near the edge are different. Considering the SYK model as a representative of the sparse class, we apply a combination of field theory and exact diagonalization to a detailed discussion of its edge spectrum. Conversely, Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity is our reference model for the dense class, where an analysis of the gravitational path integral and random matrix theory reveal universal differences to the sparse class, whose implications for the construction of holographic principles we discuss.</description>

      <title>Heavy States in 3d Gravity and 2d CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss correlators of light fields in heavy states in 3d gravity and holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary, these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some aspects of the theory of fermions living on three dimensional spacetime with a flat co-dimension one boundary are discussed, particularly a case where the boundary condition preserves scale and translation invariance but violates the residual Lorentz and conformal symmetries. This case is interesting because the Dirac equation has normalizable stationary edge states which must be taken into account in the quantization. We show that a consequence of the edge states for quantization of the Dirac field is that there are no states of the Dirac field theory which are simultaneously scale, C and P invariant even when these are good symmetries of the theory. The scale invariant states of the Dirac field contain either a nonzero scale covariant momentum density or a U(1) charge density concentrated near the edge.</description>

      <title>All-order Feynman rule for leading-twist quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an expression for the Feynman rule for leading-twist quark operators with an arbitrary number of total derivatives and an arbitrary number of gluons. This provides a generalization of known results and constitutes a necessary ingredient in the computation of the matrix elements of the corresponding operators. The result is in a form appropriate for implementation in a computer algebra system. To illustrate the latter we provide implementations in Mathematica and FORM, which are made available at https://github.com/vtsam/NKLO.</description>

      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 21 galaxies, with variations spanning three orders of magnitude in galactic mass, is also reproduced.</description>

Abstract: Basing on Mellin-Barnes representations and Miller's transformation, we present the Gel'fand-Kapranov-Zelevinsky (GKZ) hypergeometric systems of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals with arbitrary masses. Through the GKZ hypergeometric systems, the analytical hypergeometric solutions of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals with arbitrary masses can be obtained in neighborhoods of origin including infinity. The analytical expressions of 4-loop vacuum Feynman integrals can be formulated as a linear combination of the fundamental solution systems in certain convergent region.</description>

      <title>Aligned Yet Large Dipoles: a SMEFT Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a non-universal flavor scenario at the level of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, according to which the matrix of Wilson coefficients $c_{uW}$ of an up-type electroweak quark dipole operator is aligned with the up-type Yukawa coupling. Such an alignment usually follows from the assumption of Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), away from which we step by allowing the entries of $c_{uW}$ to be sizable along the first quark generations. A particular example, which we refer to as ``inverse hierarchy MFV", features Wilson coefficients inversely proportional to quark masses, and arises from BSM models respecting MFV and containing heavy fields that replicate the mass hierarchy of SM quarks. We then analyze the phenomenology driven by $c_{uW}$ at colliders and at lower-energy flavor experiments. We show that precision measurements of the process $pp\rightarrow W h\rightarrow \gamma\gamma\ell\nu$ at FCC-$hh$ could set an upper bound on $|c_{uW}|\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$, with $\Lambda$ the cutoff of the effective field theory. This bound is an order of magnitude stronger than the existing LHC bounds. Moreover, we estimate that $W h\rightarrow b\bar b \ell\nu$ at HL-LHC could also give competitive bounds. In the low-energy regime, we consider bounds arising from rare kaon decays, which turn out to be loose, $|c_{uW}^{11}|&lt;\mathcal{O}(1)(\Lambda/{\rm TeV})^{2}$. We finally demonstrate that our flavor and operator assumptions can be derived from a weakly-coupled UV model, which we choose to simultaneously illustrate the UV origin of inverse hierarchy MFV.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic quantum motions of spin--zero scalar bosons via the Duffin--Kemmer--Petiau (DKP) equation with a position--dependent mass (PDM) system in the background of the topological defect space--time produced by a cosmic string. We determine the radial wave equation and obtain the exact analytical solutions of the wave equation for the linear and Cornell--type potential through the Bi--Confluent Heun differential equation.

      <title>Phenomenology of Horndeski Gravity under Positivity Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective action for quantum gravity coupled to matter contains corrections arising from the functional measure. We analyse the effect of such corrections for anisotropic self-gravitating compact objects described by means of the gravitational decoupling method applied to isotropic solutions of the Einstein field equations. In particular, we consider the Tolman IV solution of general relativity and show that quantum gravity effects can modify the effective energy density as well as the effective tangential and radial pressures. For a suitable choice of the mimicking constant, upper bounds on the quantum corrections can be driven by the surface redshift of the anisotropic compact stellar system obtained with the gravitational decoupling.</description>

Abstract: The observable universe is fundamentally inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Quantum description of the generation of these inhomogeneities and anisotropies is ill-understood and unsatisfactory. After providing a brief account of the standard approach of the generation of the classical density perturbations starting from the quantum fluctuations of inflaton field, I critically review various assumptions which are crucial for the success of this description, and point out various shortcomings around it. I also discuss the basic ideas and recent works by using an alternative path to overcome those shortcomings which is motivated by the so-called Collapse Model interpretation of quantum mechanics. Inspired by these works, I argue the necessity of constructing a class of manifestly inhomogeneous and anisotropic quantum states after inflation and discuss my recent works which provide one such prescription of building such a state, called the $T-$vacuum, defined in the radiation dominated stage of the early universe.</description>

      <title>The modular properties of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ torus $1$-point functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory and its axiomatisation in terms of vertex operator algebras or chiral algebras are most commonly considered on the Riemann sphere. However, an important constraint in physics and an interesting source of mathematics is the fact that conformal field theories are expected to be well defined on any Riemann surface. To this end, a thorough understanding of chiral torus 1-point functions, ideally including explicit formulae, is a prerequisite for a detailed understanding of higher genera. These are distinguished from characters or vacuum torus 1-point functions because the insertion point is explicitly allowed to be labelled by any module over the vertex operator algebra rather than just the vertex operator algebra itself.
  Compellingly, chiral torus 1-point functions exhibit interesting modular properties, which we explore here in the example of the simple affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ vertex operator algebras at non-negative integral levels. We determine the dimension of the space spanned by such functions, choose a natural basis to construct vector-valued modular forms and describe the congruence properties of these forms. In particular, we find explicit generators for the spaces of all vector-valued modular forms of dimension at most three, when the insertion comes from a simple module other than the vertex operator algebra. Finally, we use the fact that categories of modules over rational vertex operator algebras are modular tensor categories to give explicit formulae for the action of the modular group on chiral torus 1-point functions entirely in terms of categorical data. The usual modular $\mathsf{S}$ and $\mathsf{T}$ matrices of characters are known not to be complete invariants of modular tensor categories, so these generalised modular data are good candidates for more fine-grained invariants.</description>

Abstract: Cosmic censorship protects the outside world from black hole singularities and paves the way for assigning entropy to gravity at the event horizons. We point out a tension between cosmic censorship and the quantum backreacted geometry of Schwarzschild black holes, induced by vacuum polarization and driven by the conformal anomaly. A similar tension appears for the Weyl curvature hypothesis at the Big Bang singularity. We argue that the requirement of exact conformal symmetry resolves both conflicts and has major implications for constraining the set of fundamental constituents of the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extensively study long-time dynamics and fate of topologically-ordered state in toric code model evolving through a projective measurement-only circuit. The circuit is composed of several measurement operators corresponding to each term of toric code Hamiltonian with magnetic-field perturbations, which is a gauge-fixed version of a (2+1)-dimensional gauge-Higgs model. We employ a cylinder geometry to classify stationary states after long-time measurement dynamics. The appearing stationary states depend on measurement probabilities for each measurement operator. The Higgs, confined and deconfined phases exist in the time evolution by the circuit. We find that both the Higgs and confined phases are clearly separated from the deconfined phase by topological entanglement entropy, whereas the phase boundary between the Higgs and confined phases is obtained by long-range orders on the boundaries supporting the recent observation that the Higgs and confined phases are both one of symmetry-protected-topological states.</description>

Abstract: We consider $d$-dimensional quantum systems which for positive times evolve with a time-independent Hamiltonian in a nonequilibrium state that we keep generic in order to account for arbitrary evolution at negative times. We show how the one-point functions of local operators depend on the coefficients of the expansion of the nonequilibrium state on the basis of energy eigenstates. We express in this way the asymptotic offset and show under which conditions oscillations around this value stay undamped at large times. We also show how, in the case of small quenches, the structure of the general results simplifies and reproduces that known perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics admits a CP-violating contribution to the action, the $\theta$ term, which is expected to give rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment of the neutron. Despite intensive search, no CP violations have been found in the strong interaction. This puzzle is referred to as the strong CP problem. There is evidence that CP is conserved in the confining theory, to the extent that color charges are totally screened for $\theta &gt; 0$ at large distances. It is not immediately obvious that this implies a vanishing dipole moment though. With this Letter I will close the gap. It is shown that in the infinite volume hadron correlation functions decouple from the topological charge, expressed in terms of the zero modes. The reason is that hadrons have a limited range of interaction, while the density of zero modes vanishes with the inverse root of the volume, thus reducing the probability of finding a zero mode in the vicinity to zero. This implies, beyond doubt, that CP is conserved in the strong interaction.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tunneling phenomenon of a charged Dirac particle emerging from a thermal horizon of a hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter (HNKNK-AdS) black hole. Considering the tunneling formalism, we report the Hawking temperature of the charged Dirac particle through the horizon and the heat capacity of the HNKNK-AdS black hole. It is found that the effective Hawking temperature for the black hole depends on the black hole's parameters, such as electric and magnetic charges, magnetic mass, the cosmological constant, and the angular momentum of the black hole. The Hawking radiation for the Kerr-Newman black hole is reduced. It is shown that there is a small correction to the Hawking thermal spectrum. The heat capacity for the HNKNK-AdS black hole is found different from the previous work, and for the Kerr-Newman black hole is also reduced.</description>

      <title>The $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ twisted gradient flow strong coupling without topology freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of topology in the lattice determination of the renormalized strong coupling via the gradient flow. This is done adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to deal with the infamous topological freezing problem that affects standard local updating algorithms. We show that, even in the presence of severe topological freezing, both algorithms yield the same strong coupling once projected onto a fixed topological sector. Moreover, we show that using a non-projected definition of the coupling leads to the same step-scaling sequence. This means that projecting the coupling onto a fixed topological sector does not affect the determination of the dynamically-generated scale of the theory $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Locally finite two-loop amplitudes for electroweak production through gluon fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of two-loop amplitudes for the production of multiple Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons via gluon fusion with exact dependence on quark masses relies primarily on numerical methods. We propose a framework that enables their numerical evaluation in momentum space. The method is inspired by the factorization of infrared divergences in QCD scattering amplitudes. It extends techniques introduced for electroweak gauge boson production from quark-antiquark annihilation to processes with external gluons. By combining diagrammatic integrands, we make use of local cancellations between diagrams that automatically eliminate most non-factoring infrared singularities. With a limited number of counterterms, we then derive two-loop integrands for which all soft and collinear singularities factorize locally. We hope that the local subtraction techniques presented in this article will play a useful role in extending the local factorization formalism to two-loop amplitudes for arbitrary processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying the genesis of magnetic fields in the Universe and explore their potential in addressing the matter-antimatter asymmetry. We construct consistent models that generate the helical magnetic field consistent with observations. We also develop an effective field theory approach to magnetogenesis, where the choice of EFT parameters describes the magnetogenesis scenario in the early Universe, and different choices of parameters correspond to different models. Our EFT explicitly shows that generating primordial magnetic fields requires two necessary conditions: conformal invariance breaking and causal propagation. Furthermore, we establish that the presence of a strong magnetic field near compact objects, such as neutron stars, aids in understanding the phenomenon of Fast radio bursts through the conversion of gravitational waves to electromagnetic waves in the background of a strong transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a system with one conserved charge the charge diffusion is modified by non-linear self-interactions within an effective field theory (EFT) of diffusive fluctuations. We include the slowest ultraviolet (UV) mode, constructing a UV-regulated EFT. The relaxation time of this UV mode is protected from renormalization, as supported by experimental data in a bad metal system. Furthermore, the retarded density-density Green's function acquires four branch points, eventually increasing the range of applicability. We discuss the fate of long-time-tails as well as implications for the quark gluon plasma.</description>

Abstract: We study chiral algebra in the reduction of 3D $\mathcal{N} = 2 $ supersymmetric gauge theories on an interval with the $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Dirichlet boundary conditions on both ends. By invoking the 3D ``twisted formalism'' and the 2D $\beta\gamma$-description we explicitly find the perturbative $\overline{Q}_+$ cohomology of the reduced theory. It is shown that the vertex algebras of boundary operators are enhanced by the line operators. A full non-perturbative result is found in the abelian case, where the chiral algebra is given by the rank two Narain lattice VOA, and two more equivalent descriptions are provided. Conjectures and speculations on the nonperturbative answer in the non-abelian case are also given.</description>

      <title>Kerr binary dynamics from minimal coupling and double copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new Yang-Mills Lagrangian based on a notion of minimal coupling that incorporates classical spin effects. The construction relies on the introduction of a new covariant derivative, which we name "classical spin covariant derivative", that is compatible with the three-point interaction of the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution with the gauge field. The resulting Lagrangian, beside the correct three-point coupling, predicts a unique choice for contact terms and therefore it can be used to compute higher-point amplitudes such as the Compton, unaffected by spurious poles. Using double-copy techniques we use this theory to extract gravity amplitudes and observables that are relevant to describe Kerr binary dynamics to all orders in the spin. In particular, we compute the 2PM ($\mathcal{O}(G^2_N)$) $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude between two classically spinning objects to all orders in the spin and use it to extract the 2PM scattering angle.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the linearized gravity theory in the near horizon region of the Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensional spacetime. Under the Newman-Unti gauge, we derive the most general near horizon symmetry and solution space without any near horizon fall-off condition. There are four towers of surface charges that are generic functions on the horizon associated to the near horizon symmetry. With suitable near horizon fall-off conditions, we reveal a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon supertranslation in both coordinates space and momentum space.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the power spectra in models with multiple scalar fields large enough to produce primordial black holes. We present analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. For an arbitrary number of fields we derive the criteria that can lead to an exponential amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results on a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light" scenario and show how the presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the two-field case.</description>

      <title>Phases of theories with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry and the roles of center vortices and magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the phases of theories which only have a microscopic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-form symmetry, starting with a topological BF theory and deforming it in accordance with microscopic symmetry. These theories have a well-defined notion of confinement. Prototypical examples are pure $SU(N)$ gauge theories and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories. Our analysis shows that the only generic phases are in $d=2$, only the confined phase; in $d=3$, both the confined phase and the topological BF phase; and in $d=4$, the confined phase, the topological BF phase, and a phase with a massless photon. We construct a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory with a deformation which, surprisingly, produces up to $(N-1)$ photons. We give an interpretation of these findings in terms of two competing pictures of confinement -- proliferation of monopoles and proliferation of center vortices -- and conclude that the proliferation of center vortices is a necessary but insufficient condition for confinement, while that of monopoles is both necessary and sufficient.</description>

      <title>An alternative to perturbative renormalization in 3+1 dimensional field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Censorship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual. This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons, will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Higher-group global symmetry and the bosonic M5 brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher-group symmetries are combinations of higher-form symmetries which appear in various field theories. In this paper, we explain how higher-group symmetries arise in 10d and 11d supergravities when the latter are coupled to brane sources. Motivated by this observation, we study field theories at zero and finite temperature invariant under a class of continuous Abelian higher-group symmetries. We restrict the analysis to the low-energy regime where the dynamical field content exclusively consists of Goldstone fields arising from the spontaneous breaking of higher-group and spacetime symmetries. Invariant quantities are constructed and the phases of matter are classified according to the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With respect to supergravity, we highlight how such Goldstone effective theories provide a symmetry-based interpretation for the theories living on D/M-branes. As an explicit example we construct a 6-group invariant action for the bosonic M5 brane, consistent with the self-duality of the 3-form field strength on the brane. While the self-duality condition in the bosonic case needs to be imposed externally as a constraint at zero temperature, we find an equilibrium effective action for the bosonic M5 brane at finite temperature that inherently implements self-duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1810.00078v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [MT2] the Vafa-Witten theory of complex projective surfaces is lifted to oriented $\mathbb C^*$-equivariant cohomology theories. Here we study the K-theoretic refinement. It gives rational functions in $t^{1/2}$ invariant under $t^{1/2}\leftrightarrow t^{-1/2}$ which specialise to numerical Vafa-Witten invariants at $t=1$. On the "instanton branch" the invariants give the virtual $\chi_{-t}^{}$-genus refinement of G\"ottsche-Kool. Applying modularity to their calculations gives predictions for the contribution of the "monopole branch". We calculate some cases and find perfect agreement. We also do calculations on K3 surfaces, finding Jacobi forms refining the usual modular forms, proving a conjecture of G\"ottsche-Kool. We determine the K-theoretic virtual classes of degeneracy loci using Eagon-Northcott complexes, and show they calculate refined Vafa-Witten invariants. Using this Laarakker [Laa] proves universality results for the invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.04824v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spacetime short-distance structure at the Planck scale is governed by the Planck length, usually interpreted as a three-dimensional Euclidian length. As such, it is not Lorentz invariant and clashes with Einstein's special relativity, which is thus unable to describe the Planck scale kinematics. The solution to this problem is twofold. First, one has to re-interpret the Planck length as a Lorentz invariant four-dimensional pseudo-length. Second, to comply with a non-vanishing cosmological term~$\Lambda$, one has to replace the standard Poincar\'e-invariant special relativity with the de Sitter-invariant special relativity. Since the Planck pseudo-length does not clash with the de Sitter-invariant special relativity, it provides a consistent description of the Planck scale kinematics in the presence of~$\Lambda$. Under the above replacement, general relativity changes to the de Sitter-invariant general relativity, in which~$\Lambda$ is constitutive. In this paper, the ensuing Friedmann equations are derived, and some implications for cosmology are explored and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study linear-perturbation equations for the two-body system of a charged dilaton black hole, of which dilaton coupling constant is $\alpha$, and a static particle with mass $m$, electric charge $q$, and dilatonic charge $\beta m$. We find that a consistent condition for the coupled equations corresponds to the equilibrium condition of the test particle. The expressions of classical fields are given in closed analytical formulas in the most interesting case with $\beta=\alpha$. We examine the electrical field around a charged dilaton black hole especially in the limit of the maximum electric charge and we find the electric Meissner effect which has been found for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell system.</description>

      <title>Ruling out models of vector dark matter in asymptotically safe quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group U(1)$_{\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark matter candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out these dark matter models.</description>

      <title>NNLO QCD corrections to semi-inclusive DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first results for the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) corrections to the semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering process in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. We consider the quark initiated flavor non-singlet process and obtain the complete contributions analytically at leading color. All relevant virtual and real emission Feynman diagrams have been computed using integration-by-parts reduction to master integrals and two approaches for their subsequent evaluation (parametric phase-space integration and method of differential equations). The numerical analysis demonstrates the significance of the NNLO corrections and their great impact on the reduction of the residual scale dependence.</description>

Abstract: I introduce a systematic procedure for constructing complete and independent sets of interactions of fields transforming under exotic representations of SU(N), in particular the SU(3) gauge group of QCD. It uncovers errors in previous results, starting with interactions of four fields including a single sextet.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address the dark energy problem.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Panic Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters, resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we elucidate how asymmetrical panic-induced herding in individuals occurs. We highlight that understanding panic escape and preventing catastrophic situations can be achieved through two crucial parameters: "population density" control and "communication (or information transfer)" among individuals in a crowd. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by asymmetrical panic escape.</description>
