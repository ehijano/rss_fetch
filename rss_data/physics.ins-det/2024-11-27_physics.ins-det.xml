      <title>A simulation framework for APD, SiPM, and MPPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Python module for simulating Silicon Photo-Multipliers, Avalanche Photo-Diodes, and Multi-Pixel Photon Counters. This module allows users to perform noise analyses: Dark Count Rate, crosstalk, and afterpulsing. Furthermore, the simulation framework novelty is the capability of simulating assemblies of SiPM arrays (MPPCa) for large area detectors like Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors, Cherenkov Telescopes, Positron Emission Tomography, and any detector using SiPM arrays. Users can simulate ring- or shower-like-shaped signals based on the expected number of photons generated by the source. We validate the performance of the simulation module with data from four different SiPM: Broadcom AFBR-S4N66P024M, Hamamatsu S14160-636050HS, Onsemi MICROFC-60035, and FBK NUV-HD3.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high-sensitivity wireless pressure sensor with active processing structure designed on the dielectric substrate has been present and evaluated in this paper. The sensor configuration has been optimized by computer-aided design to achieve highest sensitivity and maximum working range for a given dimension. With the average sensitivity of 187kHz/kPa, the proposed pressure sensor is equipped with the ability to measure pressure loaded up to 1.5MPa under room temperature. Additionally, a novel simulation method applied on pressure related design is proposed in this article, with the accuracy reaching threefold enhancement, filling the blank of electromagnetic simulation of pressure deformation. Other characteristics of the devices have been investigated and are presented.</description>

      <title>Single Event Upsets characterization of 65 nm CMOS 6T and 8T SRAM cells for ground level environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental results of the cross-section related to cosmic-ray irradiation at ground level for minimum-sized six-transistors (6T) and eight-transistors (8T) bit-cells SRAM memories implemented on a 65 nm CMOS standard technology. Results were obtained from accelerated irradiation tests performed in the mixed-field irradiation facility of the CERN High-energy Accelerator test facility (CHARM) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland. A 1.45x higher SEU cross-section was observed for 6T-cell designs despite the larger area occupied by the 8T cells (1.5x for MCU). Moreover, the trend for events affecting multiple bits was higher in 6T-cells. The cross-section obtained values show that the memories have enough sensitivity to be used as a radiation monitors in high energy physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Resistive Fine Granularity Micromegas: Characterization and Performance for Different Spark Protection Resistive Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the presented work is the development of single-stage amplification resistive Micro Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) based on Micromegas technology with the following characteristics: ability to efficiently operate up to 10 MHz/cm$^2$ counting rate; scalability to large areas; fine granularity readout with small pads of the order of mm$^2$; good spatial and time resolutions (below 100 $\mu$m and 10 ns, respectively). The miniaturization of the readout elements and the optimization of the spark protection system, as well as the stability and robustness under operation, are the primary challenges of the project. Two families of resistive patterns were realized using different techniques: pad-patterned embedded resistors and double-layer of Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) structures foils. Their main difference is that for the embedded resistors the charge is evacuated through independent pads, for double-layer DLC the resistive layers are continuous and uniform and the charge is evacuated through a network of dot-connections, several millimetres apart. Using the DLC technique, a medium-size detector with an active area of 400 cm$^2$ was recently built and tested, with the main results reported in this paper. Additionally, a large module (50x40 cm$^2$ active area), suitable for tiling large systems in future experiments, has been successfully realised and is currently undergoing testing and performance studies. The characterization and performance studies of the detectors were conducted using radioactive sources and an X-rays generator, with the detectors operated with various gas mixtures. A comparison of the results obtained with different resistive layouts and configurations is provided, with a particular focus on the response under high-rate exposure. Key results on tracking and timing performance from test-beam data for the latest constructed medium-size detector are also presented.</description>

      <title>Scanning Thermal Microscopy in Air and Vacuum: A Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements comparing scanning thermal microscopy in air and vacuum. Signal levels are compared and resolution is probed by scanning over the edge of a nanofabricated Ag square embedded in SiO2. Signals measured in air were seen to be 2.5 to 40 times larger than in vacuum. Furthermore, the air signals were stable while the vacuum signals varied significantly. Edge widths measured in air were approximately 39 % larger than those measured in vacuum. Our observations are consistent with the air measurements experiencing heat transfer from the surrounding sample via conduction and convection as well as the formation of a water-related meniscus at the tip-sample junction. These results contribute to the understanding of the complex heat exchange effects that can occur in scanning thermal microscopy when it is conducted in an ambient atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Computed models of natural radiation backgrounds in qubits and superconducting detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Naturally occurring radiation backgrounds cause correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits. These backgrounds include both gamma rays produced by terrestrial radioisotopes and cosmic rays. We use the particle-transport code Geant4 and the PARMA summary of the cosmic-ray spectrum to model both sources of natural radiation and to study their effects in the typical substrates used in superconducting electronics. We focus especially on three rates that summarize radiation's effect on substrates. We give analytic expressions for these rates, and how they depend upon parameters including laboratory elevation, substrate material, ceiling thickness, and wafer area and thickness. The modeled rates and the distribution of event energies are consistent with our earlier measurement of radiation backgrounds using a silicon thermal kinetic-inductance detector.</description>

      <title>A Haptic-Based Proximity Sensing System for Buried Object in Granular Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proximity perception of objects in granular materials is significant, especially for applications like minesweeping. However, due to particles' opacity and complex properties, existing proximity sensors suffer from high costs from sophisticated hardware and high user-cost from unintuitive results. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective proximity sensing system for underground stuff based on the haptic feedback of the sensor-granules interaction. We study and employ the unique characteristic of particles -- failure wedge zone, and combine the machine learning method -- Gaussian process regression, to identify the force signal changes induced by the proximity of objects, so as to achieve near-field perception. Furthermore, we design a novel trajectory to control the probe searching in granules for a wide range of perception. Also, our proximity sensing system can adaptively determine optimal parameters for robustness operation in different particles. Experiments demonstrate our system can perceive underground objects over 0.5 to 7 cm in advance among various materials.</description>

      <title>Virtual Pulse Reconstruction Diagnostic for Single-Shot Measurement of Free Electron Laser Radiation Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of radiation pulse profiles is crucial for optimizing beam quality and enhancing experimental outcomes in Free Electron Laser (FEL) research. In this paper, we present a novel approach that employs machine learning techniques for real-time virtual diagnostics of FEL radiation pulses. Our advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tool utilizes longitudinal phase space data obtained from the X-band transverse deflecting structure to reconstruct the temporal profile of FEL pulses in real time. Unlike traditional single-shot methods, this AI-driven solution provides a non-invasive, highly efficient alternative for pulse characterization. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models, our method facilitates precise single-shot measurements of FEL pulse power, offering significant advantages for FEL science research. This work outlines the conceptual framework, methodology, and validation results of our virtual diagnostic tool, demonstrating its potential to significantly impact FEL research.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance current sensor for visible to near-infrared wavelength transition-edge sensor readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors based on the superconducting transition-edge sensor are used in a number of visible to near-infrared applications, particularly for photon-number-resolving measurements in quantum information science. To be practical for large-scale spectroscopic imaging or photonic quantum computing applications, the size of visible to near-infrared transition-edge sensor arrays and their associated readouts must be increased from a few pixels to many thousands. In this manuscript, we introduce the kinetic inductance current sensor, a scalable readout technology that exploits the nonlinear kinetic inductance in a superconducting resonator to make sensitive current measurements. Kinetic inductance current sensors can replace superconducting quantum interference devices for many applications because of their ability to measure fast, high slew-rate signals, their compatibility with standard microwave frequency-division multiplexing techniques, and their relatively simple fabrication. Here, we demonstrate the readout of a visible to near-infrared transition-edge sensor using a kinetic inductance current sensor with 3.7 MHz of bandwidth. We measure a readout noise of 1.4 pA/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, considerably below the detector noise at frequencies of interest, and an energy resolution of $(0.137 \pm 0.001)$ eV at 0.8 eV, comparable to resolutions observed with non-multiplexed superconducting quantum interference device readouts.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>Method to Reduce Noise for Measurement of $^7$Be and $^8$B Solar Neutrinos on Gallium-71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10157v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gallium solar neutrino experiments have historically used radiochemical counting to determine the event rate. A detector which directly measures the ejected electron and de-excitation gamma could reduce background counting rates by way of a double-pulse technique. We find this reduction could be as large as 10 orders of magnitude in a 100 ton detector. In this process, the detector measures the excited nuclear final state of the germanium after an electron neutrino interacts with gallium nucleus through the charged-current interaction. This results in a loss of approximately 90\% of the total neutrino signal, but higher energy processes are less suppressed. The neutrinos resulting from this higher energy selection are predominantly from the {}$^8$B and {}$^7$Be solar neutrino fluxes.</description>
