      <title>A review of handcrafted and deep radiomics in neurological diseases: transitioning from oncology to clinical neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical imaging technologies have undergone extensive development, enabling non-invasive visualization of clinical information. The traditional review of medical images by clinicians remains subjective, time-consuming, and prone to human error. With the recent availability of medical imaging data, quantification have become important goals in the field. Radiomics, a methodology aimed at extracting quantitative information from imaging data, has emerged as a promising approach to uncover hidden biological information and support decision-making in clinical practice. This paper presents a review of the radiomic pipeline from the clinical neuroimaging perspective, providing a detailed overview of each step with practical advice. It discusses the application of handcrafted and deep radiomics in neuroimaging, stratified by neurological diagnosis. Although radiomics shows great potential for increasing diagnostic precision and improving treatment quality in neurology, several limitations hinder its clinical implementation. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts, advancements in image harmonization methods, and the establishment of reproducible and standardized pipelines with transparent reporting. By overcoming these obstacles, radiomics can significantly impact clinical neurology and enhance patient care.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications for 3D Human Face Transmission with Neural Radiance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the transmission of three-dimensional (3D) human face content for immersive communication over a rate-constrained transmitter-receiver link. We propose a new framework named NeRF-SeCom, which leverages neural radiance fields (NeRF) and semantic communications to improve the quality of 3D visualizations while minimizing the communication overhead. In the NeRF-SeCom framework, we first train a NeRF face model based on the NeRFBlendShape method, which is pre-shared between the transmitter and receiver as the semantic knowledge base to facilitate the real-time transmission. Next, with knowledge base, the transmitter extracts and sends only the essential semantic features for the receiver to reconstruct 3D face in real time. To optimize the transmission efficiency, we classify the expression features into static and dynamic types. Over each video chunk, static features are transmitted once for all frames, whereas dynamic features are transmitted over a portion of frames to adhere to rate constraints. Additionally, we propose a feature prediction mechanism, which allows the receiver to predict the dynamic features for frames that are not transmitted. Experiments show that our proposed NeRF-SeCom framework significantly outperforms benchmark methods in delivering high-quality 3D visualizations of human faces.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of Brain Metastases in MRI: A Two-Stage Deep Learning Approach with Modality Impact Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain metastasis segmentation poses a significant challenge in medical imaging due to the complex presentation and variability in size and location of metastases. In this study, we first investigate the impact of different imaging modalities on segmentation performance using a 3D U-Net. Through a comprehensive analysis, we determine that combining all available modalities does not necessarily enhance performance. Instead, the combination of T1-weighted with contrast enhancement (T1c), T1-weighted (T1), and FLAIR modalities yields superior results. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage detection and segmentation model specifically designed to accurately segment brain metastases. Our approach demonstrates that leveraging three key modalities (T1c, T1, and FLAIR) achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to single-pass deep learning models. This targeted combination allows for precise segmentation, capturing even small metastases that other models often miss. Our model sets a new benchmark in brain metastasis segmentation, highlighting the importance of strategic modality selection and multi-stage processing in medical imaging. Our implementation is freely accessible to the research community on \href{https://github.com/xmindflow/Met-Seg}{GitHub}.</description>

      <title>OCTolyzer: Fully automatic analysis toolkit for segmentation and feature extracting in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To describe OCTolyzer: an open-source toolkit for retinochoroidal analysis in optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) images.
  Method: OCTolyzer has two analysis suites, for SLO and OCT images. The former enables anatomical segmentation and feature measurement of the en face retinal vessels. The latter leverages image metadata for retinal layer segmentations and deep learning-based choroid layer segmentation to compute retinochoroidal measurements such as thickness and volume. We introduce OCTolyzer and assess the reproducibility of its OCT analysis suite for choroid analysis.
  Results: At the population-level, choroid region metrics were highly reproducible (Mean absolute error/Pearson/Spearman correlation for macular volume choroid thickness (CT):6.7$\mu$m/0.9933/0.9969, macular B-scan CT:11.6$\mu$m/0.9858/0.9889, peripapillary CT:5.0$\mu$m/0.9942/0.9940). Macular choroid vascular index (CVI) had good reproducibility (volume CVI:0.0271/0.9669/0.9655, B-scan CVI:0.0130/0.9090/0.9145). At the eye-level, measurement error in regional and vessel metrics were below 5% and 20% of the population's variability, respectively. Major outliers were from poor quality B-scans with thick choroids and invisible choroid-sclera boundary.
  Conclusions: OCTolyzer is the first open-source pipeline to convert OCT/SLO data into reproducible and clinically meaningful retinochoroidal measurements. OCT processing on a standard laptop CPU takes under 2 seconds for macular or peripapillary B-scans and 85 seconds for volume scans. OCTolyzer can help improve standardisation in the field of OCT/SLO image analysis and is freely available here: https://github.com/jaburke166/OCTolyzer.</description>

      <title>ESP-MedSAM: Efficient Self-Prompting SAM for Universal Domain-Generalized Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated outstanding adaptation to medical image segmentation but still faces three major challenges. Firstly, the huge computational costs of SAM limit its real-world applicability. Secondly, SAM depends on manual annotations (e.g., points, boxes) as prompts, which are laborious and impractical in clinical scenarios. Thirdly, SAM handles all segmentation targets equally, which is suboptimal for diverse medical modalities with inherent heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Self-Prompting SAM for universal medical image segmentation, named ESP-MedSAM. We devise a Multi-Modal Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (MMDKD) strategy to distil common image knowledge and domain-specific medical knowledge from the foundation model to train a lightweight image encoder and a modality controller. Further, they combine with the additionally introduced Self-Patch Prompt Generator (SPPG) and Query-Decoupled Modality Decoder (QDMD) to construct ESP-MedSAM. Specifically, SPPG aims to generate a set of patch prompts automatically and QDMD leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality. Extensive experiments indicate that ESP-MedSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation takes, displaying superior zero-shot learning and modality transfer ability. Especially, our framework uses only 31.4% parameters compared to SAM-Base.</description>

      <title>TaGAT: Topology-Aware Graph Attention Network For Multi-modal Retinal Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of medical image fusion, integrating information from various modalities is crucial for improving diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in retinal health, where the important features exhibit differently in different imaging modalities. Existing deep learning-based approaches insufficiently focus on retinal image fusion, and thus fail to preserve enough anatomical structure and fine vessel details in retinal image fusion. To address this, we propose the Topology-Aware Graph Attention Network (TaGAT) for multi-modal retinal image fusion, leveraging a novel Topology-Aware Encoder (TAE) with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to effectively enhance spatial features with retinal vasculature's graph topology across modalities. The TAE encodes the base and detail features, extracted via a Long-short Range (LSR) encoder from retinal images, into the graph extracted from the retinal vessel. Within the TAE, the GAT-based Graph Information Update (GIU) block dynamically refines and aggregates the node features to generate topology-aware graph features. The updated graph features with base and detail features are combined and decoded as a fused image. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Fluorescein Fundus Angiography (FFA) with Color Fundus (CF) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) with confocal microscopy retinal image fusion.

      <title>Large Kernel Distillation Network for Efficient Single Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and lightweight single-image super-resolution (SISR) has achieved remarkable performance in recent years. One effective approach is the use of large kernel designs, which have been shown to improve the performance of SISR models while reducing their computational requirements. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still face problems such as high computational costs. To address these issues, we propose the Large Kernel Distillation Network (LKDN) in this paper. Our approach simplifies the model structure and introduces more efficient attention modules to reduce computational costs while also improving performance. Specifically, we employ the reparameterization technique to enhance model performance without adding extra cost. We also introduce a new optimizer from other tasks to SISR, which improves training speed and performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that LKDN outperforms existing lightweight SR methods and achieves SOTA performance.</description>

      <title>Dataset Distillation in Medical Imaging: A Feasibility Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data sharing in the medical image analysis field has potential yet remains underappreciated. The aim is often to share datasets efficiently with other sites to train models effectively. One possible solution is to avoid transferring the entire dataset while still achieving similar model performance. Recent progress in data distillation within computer science offers promising prospects for sharing medical data efficiently without significantly compromising model effectiveness. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods would be applicable to medical imaging, since medical and natural images are distinct fields. Moreover, it is intriguing to consider what level of performance could be achieved with these methods. To answer these questions, we conduct investigations on a variety of leading data distillation methods, in different contexts of medical imaging. We evaluate the feasibility of these methods with extensive experiments in two aspects: 1) Assess the impact of data distillation across multiple datasets characterized by minor or great variations. 2) Explore the indicator to predict the distillation performance. Our extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets reveal that data distillation can significantly reduce dataset size while maintaining comparable model performance to that achieved with the full dataset, suggesting that a small, representative sample of images can serve as a reliable indicator of distillation success. This study demonstrates that data distillation is a viable method for efficient and secure medical data sharing, with the potential to facilitate enhanced collaborative research and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Time Series Generative Learning with Application to Brain Imaging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the analysis of sequential image data, particularly brain imaging data such as MRI, fMRI, CT, with the motivation of understanding the brain aging process and neurodegenerative diseases. To achieve this goal, we investigate image generation in a time series context. Specifically, we formulate a min-max problem derived from the $f$-divergence between neighboring pairs to learn a time series generator in a nonparametric manner. The generator enables us to generate future images by transforming prior lag-k observations and a random vector from a reference distribution. With a deep neural network learned generator, we prove that the joint distribution of the generated sequence converges to the latent truth under a Markov and a conditional invariance condition. Furthermore, we extend our generation mechanism to a panel data scenario to accommodate multiple samples. The effectiveness of our mechanism is evaluated by generating real brain MRI sequences from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. These generated image sequences can be used as data augmentation to enhance the performance of further downstream tasks, such as Alzheimer's disease detection.</description>

      <title>Seismic Fault SAM: Adapting SAM with Lightweight Modules and 2.5D Strategy for Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seismic fault detection holds significant geographical and practical application value, aiding experts in subsurface structure interpretation and resource exploration. Despite some progress made by automated methods based on deep learning, research in the seismic domain faces significant challenges, particularly because it is difficult to obtain high-quality, large-scale, open-source, and diverse datasets, which hinders the development of general foundation models. Therefore, this paper proposes Seismic Fault SAM, which, for the first time, applies the general pre-training foundation model-Segment Anything Model (SAM)-to seismic fault interpretation. This method aligns the universal knowledge learned from a vast amount of images with the seismic domain tasks through an Adapter design. Specifically, our innovative points include designing lightweight Adapter modules, freezing most of the pre-training weights, and only updating a small number of parameters to allow the model to converge quickly and effectively learn fault features; combining 2.5D input strategy to capture 3D spatial patterns with 2D models; integrating geological constraints into the model through prior-based data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's generalization capability. Experimental results on the largest publicly available seismic dataset, Thebe, show that our method surpasses existing 3D models on both OIS and ODS metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance and providing an effective extension scheme for other seismic domain downstream tasks that lack labeled data.</description>

      <title>Double-Shot 3D Shape Measurement with a Dual-Branch Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structured light (SL)-based 3D measurement techniques with deep learning have been widely studied, among which speckle projection profilometry (SPP) and fringe projection profilometry (FPP) are two popular methods. However, they generally use a single projection pattern for reconstruction, resulting in fringe order ambiguity or poor reconstruction accuracy. To alleviate these problems, we propose a parallel dual-branch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Transformer network (PDCNet), to take advantage of convolutional operations and self-attention mechanisms for processing different SL modalities. Within PDCNet, a Transformer branch is used to capture global perception in the fringe images, while a CNN branch is designed to collect local details in the speckle images. To fully integrate complementary features, we design a double-stream attention aggregation module (DAAM) that consist of a parallel attention subnetwork for aggregating multi-scale spatial structure information. This module can dynamically retain local and global representations to the maximum extent. Moreover, an adaptive mixture density head with bimodal Gaussian distribution is proposed for learning a representation that is precise near discontinuities. Compared to the standard disparity regression strategy, this adaptive mixture head can effectively improves performance at object boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can reduce fringe order ambiguity while producing high-accuracy results on a self-made dataset. We also show that the proposed architecture reveals the potential in infrared-visible image fusion task.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network for Single Image Deraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image deraining aims to improve the visibility of images damaged by rainy conditions, targeting the removal of degradation elements such as rain streaks, raindrops, and rain accumulation. While numerous single image deraining methods have shown promising results in image enhancement within the spatial domain, real-world rain degradation often causes uneven damage across an image's entire frequency spectrum, posing challenges for these methods in enhancing different frequency components. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end Adaptive Frequency Enhancement Network (AFENet) specifically for single image deraining that adaptively enhances images across various frequencies. We employ convolutions of different scales to adaptively decompose image frequency bands, introduce a feature enhancement module to boost the features of different frequency components and present a novel interaction module for interchanging and merging information from various frequency branches. Simultaneously, we propose a feature aggregation module that efficiently and adaptively fuses features from different frequency bands, facilitating enhancements across the entire frequency spectrum. This approach empowers the deraining network to eliminate diverse and complex rainy patterns and to reconstruct image details accurately. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method not only achieves visually appealing enhancement results but also surpasses existing methods in performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Layout Hotspot Detection Efficiency with YOLOv8 and PCA-Guided Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a YOLO-based framework for layout hotspot detection, aiming to enhance the efficiency and performance of the design rule checking (DRC) process. Our approach leverages the YOLOv8 vision model to detect multiple hotspots within each layout image, even when dealing with large layout image sizes. Additionally, to enhance pattern-matching effectiveness, we introduce a novel approach to augment the layout image using information extracted through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The core of our proposed method is an algorithm that utilizes PCA to extract valuable auxiliary information from the layout image. This extracted information is then incorporated into the layout image as an additional color channel. This augmentation significantly improves the accuracy of multi-hotspot detection while reducing the false alarm rate of the object detection algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework using four datasets generated from layouts found in the ICCAD-2019 benchmark dataset. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves a precision (recall) of approximately 83% (86%) while maintaining a false alarm rate of less than 7.4\%. Also, the studies show that the proposed augmentation approach could improve the detection ability of never-seen-before (NSB) hotspots by about 10%.</description>

      <title>Cross-Task Data Augmentation by Pseudo-label Generation for Region Based Coronary Artery Instance Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronary Artery Diseases (CADs) although preventable, are one of the leading causes of death and disability. Diagnosis of these diseases is often difficult and resource intensive. Angiographic imaging segmentation of the arteries has evolved as a tool of assistance that helps clinicians make an accurate diagnosis. However, due to the limited amount of data and the difficulty in curating a dataset, the task of segmentation has proven challenging. In this study, we introduce the use of pseudo-labels to address the issue of limited data in the angiographic dataset to enhance the performance of the baseline YOLO model. Unlike existing data augmentation techniques that improve the model constrained to a fixed dataset, we introduce the use of pseudo-labels generated on a dataset of separate related task to diversify and improve model performance. This method increases the baseline F1 score by 9% in the validation data set and by 3% in the test data set.</description>

      <title>Towards Architecture-Agnostic Untrained Network Priors for Image Reconstruction with Frequency Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Untrained networks inspired by deep image priors have shown promising capabilities in recovering high-quality images from noisy or partial measurements without requiring training sets. Their success is widely attributed to implicit regularization due to the spectral bias of suitable network architectures. However, the application of such network-based priors often entails superfluous architectural decisions, risks of overfitting, and lengthy optimization processes, all of which hinder their practicality. To address these challenges, we propose efficient architecture-agnostic techniques to directly modulate the spectral bias of network priors: 1) bandwidth-constrained input, 2) bandwidth-controllable upsamplers, and 3) Lipschitz-regularized convolutional layers. We show that, with just a few lines of code, we can reduce overfitting in underperforming architectures and close performance gaps with high-performing counterparts, minimizing the need for extensive architecture tuning. This makes it possible to employ a more compact model to achieve performance similar or superior to larger models while reducing runtime. Demonstrated on inpainting-like MRI reconstruction task, our results signify for the first time that architectural biases, overfitting, and runtime issues of untrained network priors can be simultaneously addressed without architectural modifications. Our code is publicly available.</description>

      <title>WDM: 3D Wavelet Diffusion Models for High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the three-dimensional nature of CT- or MR-scans, generative modeling of medical images is a particularly challenging task. Existing approaches mostly apply patch-wise, slice-wise, or cascaded generation techniques to fit the high-dimensional data into the limited GPU memory. However, these approaches may introduce artifacts and potentially restrict the model's applicability for certain downstream tasks. This work presents WDM, a wavelet-based medical image synthesis framework that applies a diffusion model on wavelet decomposed images. The presented approach is a simple yet effective way of scaling 3D diffusion models to high resolutions and can be trained on a single \SI{40}{\giga\byte} GPU. Experimental results on BraTS and LIDC-IDRI unconditional image generation at a resolution of $128 \times 128 \times 128$ demonstrate state-of-the-art image fidelity (FID) and sample diversity (MS-SSIM) scores compared to recent GANs, Diffusion Models, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our proposed method is the only one capable of generating high-quality images at a resolution of $256 \times 256 \times 256$, outperforming all comparing methods.</description>

      <title>DPER: Diffusion Prior Driven Neural Representation for Limited Angle and Sparse View CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited-angle and sparse-view computed tomography (LACT and SVCT) are crucial for expanding the scope of X-ray CT applications. However, they face challenges due to incomplete data acquisition, resulting in diverse artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. Emerging implicit neural representation (INR) techniques, such as NeRF, NeAT, and NeRP, have shown promise in under-determined CT imaging reconstruction tasks. However, the unsupervised nature of INR architecture imposes limited constraints on the solution space, particularly for the highly ill-posed reconstruction task posed by LACT and ultra-SVCT. In this study, we introduce the Diffusion Prior Driven Neural Representation (DPER), an advanced unsupervised framework designed to address the exceptionally ill-posed CT reconstruction inverse problems. DPER adopts the Half Quadratic Splitting (HQS) algorithm to decompose the inverse problem into data fidelity and distribution prior sub-problems. The two sub-problems are respectively addressed by INR reconstruction scheme and pre-trained score-based diffusion model. This combination first injects the implicit image local consistency prior from INR. Additionally, it effectively augments the feasibility of the solution space for the inverse problem through the generative diffusion model, resulting in increased stability and precision in the solutions. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of DPER on LACT and ultra-SVCT reconstruction with two public datasets (AAPM and LIDC), an in-house clinical COVID-19 dataset and a public raw projection dataset created by Mayo Clinic. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods on in-domain datasets, while achieving significant performance improvements on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets.</description>

      <title>SynthBA: Reliable Brain Age Estimation Across Multiple MRI Sequences and Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain age is a critical measure that reflects the biological ageing process of the brain. The gap between brain age and chronological age, referred to as brain PAD (Predicted Age Difference), has been utilized to investigate neurodegenerative conditions. Brain age can be predicted using MRIs and machine learning techniques. However, existing methods are often sensitive to acquisition-related variabilities, such as differences in acquisition protocols, scanners, MRI sequences, and resolutions, significantly limiting their application in highly heterogeneous clinical settings. In this study, we introduce Synthetic Brain Age (SynthBA), a robust deep-learning model designed for predicting brain age. SynthBA utilizes an advanced domain randomization technique, ensuring effective operation across a wide array of acquisition-related variabilities. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of SynthBA, we evaluate its predictive capabilities on internal and external datasets, encompassing various MRI sequences and resolutions, and compare it with state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we calculate the brain PAD in a large cohort of subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), demonstrating a significant correlation with AD-related measures of cognitive dysfunction. SynthBA holds the potential to facilitate the broader adoption of brain age prediction in clinical settings, where re-training or fine-tuning is often unfeasible. The SynthBA source code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/LemuelPuglisi/SynthBA.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Accurate Diagnosis of Acute Aortic Syndrome using Non-contrast CT: A Large-scale, Retrospective, Multi-center and AI-based Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chest pain symptoms are highly prevalent in emergency departments (EDs), where acute aortic syndrome (AAS) is a catastrophic cardiovascular emergency with a high fatality rate, especially when timely and accurate treatment is not administered. However, current triage practices in the ED can cause up to approximately half of patients with AAS to have an initially missed diagnosis or be misdiagnosed as having other acute chest pain conditions. Subsequently, these AAS patients will undergo clinically inaccurate or suboptimal differential diagnosis. Fortunately, even under these suboptimal protocols, nearly all these patients underwent non-contrast CT covering the aorta anatomy at the early stage of differential diagnosis. In this study, we developed an artificial intelligence model (DeepAAS) using non-contrast CT, which is highly accurate for identifying AAS and provides interpretable results to assist in clinical decision-making. Performance was assessed in two major phases: a multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750) and an exploration in real-world emergency scenarios (n = 137,525). In the multi-center cohort, DeepAAS achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the real-world cohort, DeepAAS detected 109 AAS patients with misguided initial suspicion, achieving 92.6% (95% CI 76.2%-97.5%) in mean sensitivity and 99.2% (95% CI 99.1%-99.3%) in mean specificity. Our AI model performed well on non-contrast CT at all applicable early stages of differential diagnosis workflows, effectively reduced the overall missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis rate from 48.8% to 4.8% and shortened the diagnosis time for patients with misguided initial suspicion from an average of 681.8 (74-11,820) mins to 68.5 (23-195) mins. DeepAAS could effectively fill the gap in the current clinical workflow without requiring additional tests.</description>

      <title>PCAC-GAN: A Sparse-Tensor-Based Generative Adversarial Network for 3D Point Cloud Attribute Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning-based methods have proven successful in compressing geometric information for point clouds. For attribute compression, however, they still lag behind non-learning-based methods such as the MPEG G-PCC standard. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel deep learning-based point cloud attribute compression method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) with sparse convolution layers. Our method also includes a module that adaptively selects the resolution of the voxels used to voxelize the input point cloud. Sparse vectors are used to represent the voxelized point cloud, and sparse convolutions process the sparse tensors, ensuring computational efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of GANs to compress point cloud attributes. Our experimental results show that our method outperforms existing learning-based techniques and rivals the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v23) in terms of visual quality.</description>

      <title>FairDomain: Achieving Fairness in Cross-Domain Medical Image Segmentation and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing fairness in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in medical AI, is crucial for ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes. Recent efforts to enhance fairness have introduced new methodologies and datasets in medical AI. However, the fairness issue under the setting of domain transfer is almost unexplored, while it is common that clinics rely on different imaging technologies (e.g., different retinal imaging modalities) for patient diagnosis. This paper presents FairDomain, a pioneering systemic study into algorithmic fairness under domain shifts, employing state-of-the-art domain adaptation (DA) and generalization (DG) algorithms for both medical segmentation and classification tasks to understand how biases are transferred between different domains. We also introduce a novel plug-and-play fair identity attention (FIA) module that adapts to various DA and DG algorithms to improve fairness by using self-attention to adjust feature importance based on demographic attributes. Additionally, we curate the first fairness-focused dataset with two paired imaging modalities for the same patient cohort on medical segmentation and classification tasks, to rigorously assess fairness in domain-shift scenarios. Excluding the confounding impact of demographic distribution variation between source and target domains will allow clearer quantification of the performance of domain transfer models. Our extensive evaluations reveal that the proposed FIA significantly enhances both model performance accounted for fairness across all domain shift settings (i.e., DA and DG) with respect to different demographics, which outperforms existing methods on both segmentation and classification.

      <description>arXiv:2407.11084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vessel trajectory clustering, a crucial component of the maritime intelligent transportation systems, provides valuable insights for applications such as anomaly detection and trajectory prediction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most prevalent distance-based vessel trajectory clustering methods, which encompass two main steps: trajectory similarity measurement and clustering. Initially, we conducted a thorough literature review using relevant keywords to gather and summarize pertinent research papers and datasets. Then, this paper discussed the principal methods of data pre-processing that prepare data for further analysis. The survey progresses to detail the leading algorithms for measuring vessel trajectory similarity and the main clustering techniques used in the field today. Furthermore, the various applications of trajectory clustering within the maritime context are explored. Finally, the paper evaluates the effectiveness of different algorithm combinations and pre-processing methods through experimental analysis, focusing on their impact on the performance of distance-based trajectory clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of various trajectory clustering algorithms and notably highlight the significant improvements that trajectory compression techniques contribute to the efficiency and accuracy of trajectory clustering. This comprehensive approach ensures a deep understanding of current capabilities and future directions in vessel trajectory clustering.</description>

      <title>Fisheye-Calib-Adapter: An Easy Tool for Fisheye Camera Model Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing necessity for fisheye cameras in fields such as robotics and autonomous driving has led to the proposal of various fisheye camera models. While the evolution of camera models has facilitated the development of diverse systems in the field, the lack of adaptation between different fisheye camera models means that recalibration is always necessary, which is cumbersome. This paper introduces a conversion tool for various previously proposed fisheye camera models. It is user-friendly, simple, yet extremely fast and accurate, offering conversion capabilities for a broader range of models compared to existing tools. We have verified that models converted using our system perform correctly in applications such as SLAM. By utilizing our system, researchers can obtain output parameters directly from input parameters without the need for an image set and any recalibration processes, thus serving as a bridge across different fisheye camera models in various research fields. We provide our system as an open source tool available at: https://github.com/eowjd0512/fisheye-calib-adapter</description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving Transfer Learning of Deep Models via Neural Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the ever-increasing complexity of large-scale pre-trained models coupled with a shortage of labeled data for downstream training, transfer learning has become the primary approach in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal learning. Despite recent progress, the fine-tuning process for large-scale pre-trained models in vision still mostly relies on trial and error. This work investigates the relationship between neural collapse (NC) and transfer learning for classification problems. NC is an intriguing while prevalent phenomenon that has been recently discovered in terms of the final-layer features and linear classifiers of trained neural networks. Specifically, during the terminal phase of training, NC implies that the variability of the features within each class diminishes to zero, while the means of features between classes are maximally and equally distanced. In this work, we examine the NC attributes of pre-trained models on both downstream and source data for transfer learning, and we find strong correlation between feature collapse and downstream performance. In particular, we discovered a systematic pattern that emerges when linear probing pre-trained models on downstream training data: the more feature collapse of pre-trained models on downstream training data, the higher the transfer accuracy. Additionally, we also studied the relationship between NC and transfer accuracy on the source data. Moreover, these findings allow us to develop a principled, parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that employs skip-connection to induce the last-layer feature collapse on downstream data. Our proposed fine-tuning methods deliver good performances while reducing fine-tuning parameters by at least 90% and mitigating overfitting in situations especially when the downstream data is scarce.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Adaptive Cellular Recognition Under Domain Shifts: A Contextual Correspondence View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular nuclei recognition serves as a fundamental and essential step in the workflow of digital pathology. However, with disparate source organs and staining procedures among histology image clusters, the scanned tiles inherently conform to a non-uniform data distribution, which induces deteriorated promises for general cross-cohort usages. Despite the latest efforts leveraging domain adaptation to mitigate distributional discrepancy, those methods are subjected to modeling the morphological characteristics of each cell individually, disregarding the hierarchical latent structure and intrinsic contextual correspondences across the tumor micro-environment. In this work, we identify the importance of implicit correspondences across biological contexts for exploiting domain-invariant pathological composition and thereby propose to exploit the dependence over various biological structures for domain adaptive cellular recognition. We discover those high-level correspondences via unsupervised contextual modeling and use them as bridges to facilitate adaptation over diverse organs and stains. In addition, to further exploit the rich spatial contexts embedded amongst nuclear communities, we propose self-adaptive dynamic distillation to secure instance-aware trade-offs across different model constituents. The proposed method is extensively evaluated on a broad spectrum of cross-domain settings under miscellaneous data distribution shifts and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.
