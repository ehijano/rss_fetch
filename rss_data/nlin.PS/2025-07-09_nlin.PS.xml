      <title>Thouless pumping of solitons in a nonlocal medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is a fundamental phenomenon recognized as being widespread across various areas of physics, with optics holding a particularly prominent role. Here, we study this effect for optical solitons in a medium where the refractive index is shaped by two slowly sliding sublattices and a nonlocal nonlinear response. The spectral bands of such a potential can exhibit nontrivial topology, and excitations occupying these bands can undergo quantized transport governed by the space -- time Chern indices of the linear spectrum. We find that nonlocality of the medium profoundly affects the dynamics of Thouless pumping. Thus, we show that broad, low-power fundamental solitons do not exhibit transport, as they excite only a small portion of the spectral band, while high-power solitons with broader spectral projections do demonstrate stable quantized transport. The transition point between these two principally different light propagation regimes strongly depends on the degree of nonlocality of the nonlinear response and shifts to larger powers with increasing nonlocality. Notably, even a moderate level of nonlocality is sufficient to prevent the breakdown of topological transport at high powers commonly observed in local Kerr media. Beyond fundamental solitons, we also demonstrate that multipole solitons, such as dipole and tripole states can be pumped stably. This is the first time such complex soliton states have been shown to undergo Thouless pumping. While fundamental solitons require only exceeding a power threshold, multipoles exhibit stable transport only within a finite power window. This window is broader for dipoles than for tripoles and expands with increasing nonlocality, revealing a trade-off between structural complexity and stability.</description>

      <title>Slip-dominated structural transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04066v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.</description>

      <title>Controlled bit-flip of period-doubling and discrete time crystalline states in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the robustness of a bit-flip operation against thermal and quantum noise for bits represented by the symmetry-broken pairs of the period-doubled (PD) states in a classical parametric oscillator and discrete time crystal (DTC) states in a fully-connected open spin-cavity system, respectively. The bit-flip operation corresponds to switching between the two PD and DTC states induced by a defect in a periodic drive, introduced in a controlled manner by linearly ramping the phase of the modulation of the drive. In the absence of stochastic noise, strong dissipation results in a more robust bit-flip operation in which slight changes to the defect parameters do not significantly lower the success rate of bit-flips. The operation remains robust even in the presence of stochastic noise when the defect duration is sufficiently large. The fluctuations also enhance the success rate of the bit-flip below the critical defect duration needed to induce a switch. By considering parameter regimes in which the DTC states in the spin-cavity system do not directly map to the PD states, we reveal that this robustness is due to the system being quenched by the defect towards a new phase that has enough excitation to suppress the effects of the stochastic noise. This allows for precise control of the bit-flip operations by tuning into the preferred intermediate state that the system will enter during a bit-flip operation. We demonstrate this in a modified protocol based on precise quenches of the driving frequency.</description>
