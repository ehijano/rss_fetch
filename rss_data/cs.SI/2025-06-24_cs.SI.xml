      <title>Heterogeneous Temporal Hypergraph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>A family of graph GOSPA metrics for graphs with different sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric, the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes. However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Empowering Iterative Graph Alignment Using Heat Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised plain graph alignment (UPGA) aims to align corresponding nodes across two graphs without any auxiliary information. Existing UPGA methods rely on structural consistency while neglecting the inherent structural differences in real-world graphs, leading to biased node representations. Moreover, their one-shot alignment strategies lack mechanisms to correct erroneous matches arising from inaccurate anchor seeds. To address these issues, this paper proposes IterAlign, a novel parameter-free and efficient UPGA method. First, a simple yet powerful representation generation method based on heat diffusion is introduced to capture multi-level structural characteristics, mitigating the over-reliance on structural consistency and generating stable node representations. Two complementary node alignment strategies are then adopted to balance alignment accuracy and efficiency across graphs of varying scales. By alternating between representation generation and node alignment, IterAlign iteratively rectifies biases in nodes representations and refines the alignment process, leading to superior and robust alignment performance. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed IterAlign outperforms state-of-the-art UPGA approaches with a lower computational overhead, but also showcases the ability to approach the theoretical accuracy upper bound of unsupervised plain graph alignment task.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evolution of Complex Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Applying Evolutionary Games to Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex networks serve as abstract models for understanding real-world complex systems and provide frameworks for studying structured dynamical systems. This article addresses limitations in current studies on the exploration of individual birth-death and the development of community structures within dynamic systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a networked evolution model that includes the birth and death of individuals, incorporating reinforcement learning through games among individuals. Each individual has a lifespan following an arbitrary distribution, engages in games with network neighbors, selects actions using Q-learning in reinforcement learning, and moves within a two-dimensional space. The developed theories are validated through extensive experiments. Besides, we observe the evolution of cooperative behaviors and community structures in systems both with and without the birth-death process. The fitting of real-world populations and networks demonstrates the practicality of our model. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses of the model reveal that exploitation rates and payoff parameters determine the emergence of communities, learning rates affect the speed of community formation, discount factors influence stability, and two-dimensional space dimensions dictate community size. Our model offers a novel perspective on real-world community development and provides a valuable framework for studying population dynamics behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Survey on False Information Detection: From A Perspective of Propagation on Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of false information in the digital age has become a pressing concern, necessitating the development of effective and robust detection methods. This paper offers a comprehensive review of existing false information detection techniques, approached from a novel perspective that emphasizes the propagation characteristics of misinformation. We introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes these methods into homogeneous and heterogeneous propagation-based approaches, providing a deeper understanding of the varying scopes and complexities involved in information dissemination. For each category, we present a formal problem formulation, review commonly used datasets, and summarize state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we identify several promising directions for future research, including the creation of a unified benchmark suite, exploration of diverse information modalities, and development of innovative rumor debunking tasks. By systematically organizing the vast array of current techniques, this work offers a clear overview of the research landscape, aiding researchers and practitioners in navigating this complex field and inspiring further advancements.</description>

      <title>Preserving spreading dynamics and information flow in complex network reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively preserving both the structural and dynamical properties during the reduction of complex networks remains a significant research topic. Existing network reduction methods based on renormalization group or sampling often face challenges such as high computational complexity and the loss of critical dynamic attributes. This paper proposes an efficient network reduction framework based on subgraph extraction, which accurately preserves epidemic spreading dynamics and information flow through a coordinated optimization strategy of node removal and edge pruning. Specifically, a degree centrality-driven node removal algorithm is adopted to preferentially remove low-degree nodes, thereby constructing a smaller-scale subnetwork. Subsequently, an edge pruning algorithm is designed to regulate the edge density of the subnetwork, ensuring that its average degree remains approximately consistent with that of the original network. Experimental results on Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free networks, and real-world social contact networks from various domains demonstrate that this proposed method can reduce the size of networks with heterogeneous structures by more than 85%, while preserving their epidemic dynamics and information flow. These findings provide valuable insights for predicting the dynamical behavior of large-scale real-world networks.</description>

      <title>SocioXplorer: An Interactive Tool for Topic and Network Analysis in Social Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SocioXplorer is a powerful interactive tool that computational social science researchers can use to understand topics and networks in social data from Twitter (X) and YouTube. It integrates, among other things, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and social network analysis. It can be used with ``live" datasets that receive regular updates. SocioXplorer is an extension of a previous system called TwiXplorer, which was limited to the analysis of archival Twitter (X) data. SocioXplorer builds on this by adding the ability to analyse YouTube data, greater depth of analysis and batch data processing. We release it under the Apache 2 licence.</description>

      <title>Triadic Novelty: A Typology and Measurement Framework for Recognizing Novel Contributions in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress depends on novel ideas, but current reward systems often fail to recognize them. Many existing metrics conflate novelty with popularity, privileging ideas that fit existing paradigms over those that challenge them. This study develops a theory-driven framework to better understand how different types of novelty emerge, take hold, and receive recognition. Drawing on network science and theories of discovery, we introduce a triadic typology: Pioneers, who introduce entirely new topics; Mavericks, who recombine distant concepts; and Vanguards, who reinforce weak but promising connections. We apply this typology to a dataset of 41,623 articles in the interdisciplinary field of philanthropy and nonprofit studies, linking novelty types to five-year citation counts using mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Results show that novelty is not uniformly rewarded. Pioneer efforts are foundational but often overlooked. Maverick novelty shows consistent citation benefits, particularly rewarded when it displaces prior focus. Vanguard novelty is more likely to gain recognition when it strengthens weakly connected topics, but its citation advantage diminishes as those reinforced nodes become more central. To enable fair comparison across time and domains, we introduce a simulated baseline model. These findings improve the evaluation of innovations, affecting science policy, funding, and institutional assessment practices.</description>

      <title>Six Decades Post-Discovery of Taylor's Power Law: From Ecological and Statistical Universality, Through Prime Number Distributions and Tipping-Point Signals, to Heterogeneity and Stability of Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First discovered by L. R. Taylor (1961, Nature), Taylor's Power Law (TPL) correlates the mean (M) population abundances and the corresponding variances (V) across a set of insect populations using a power function (V=aM^b). TPL has demonstrated its 'universality' across numerous fields of sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This universality has inspired two main prongs of exploration: one from mathematicians and statisticians, who might instinctively respond with a convergence theorem similar to the central limit theorem of the Gaussian distribution, and another from biologists, ecologists, physicists, etc., who are more interested in potential underlying ecological or organizational mechanisms. Over the past six decades, TPL studies have produced a punctuated landscape with three relatively distinct periods (1960s-1980s; 1990s-2000s, and 2010s-2020s) across the two prongs of abstract and physical worlds. Eight themes have been identified and reviewed on this landscape, including population spatial aggregation and ecological mechanisms, TPL and skewed statistical distributions, mathematical/statistical mechanisms of TPL, sample vs. population TPL, population stability, synchrony, and early warning signals for tipping points, TPL on complex networks, TPL in macrobiomes, and in microbiomes. Three future research directions including fostering reciprocal interactions between the two prongs, heterogeneity measuring, and exploration in the context of evolution. The significance of TPL research includes practically, population fluctuations captured by TPL are relevant for agriculture, forestry, fishery, wildlife-conservation, epidemiology, tumor heterogeneity, earthquakes, social inequality, stock illiquidity, financial stability, tipping point events, etc.; theoretically, TPL is one form of power laws, which are related to phase transitions, universality, scale-invariance, etc.</description>

      <title>Neural Total Variation Distance Estimators for Changepoint Detection in News Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions, where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content, making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.</description>

      <title>Rumor Detection on Social Media with Reinforcement Learning-based Key Propagation Graph Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spread of rumors on social media, particularly during significant events like the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, poses a serious threat to social stability and public health. Current rumor detection methods primarily rely on propagation graphs to improve the model performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often compromised by noisy and irrelevant structures in the propagation process. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, they depend heavily on rich original propagation structures, limiting their effectiveness in handling rumors that lack sufficient propagation information, especially in the early stages of dissemination. In this work, we introduce the Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information and identifies significant substructures in events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG comprises two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns latent variable distributions from refined propagation patterns to eliminate noise and generate new candidates for ENS, while ENS identifies the most influential substructures in propagation graphs and provides training data for CRG. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards derived from a pre-trained graph neural network to guide the training process. The resulting key propagation graphs are then employed in downstream rumor detection tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate that KPG outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Schelling segregation dynamics in densely-connected social network graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Schelling segregation is a well-established model used to investigate the dynamics of segregation in agent-based models. Since we consider segregation to be key for the development of political polarisation, we are interested in what insights it could give for this problem. We tested basic questions of segregation on an agent-based social network model where agents' connections were not restricted by their spatial position, and made the network graph much denser than previous tests of Schelling segregation in social networks.
  We found that a dense social network does not become as strongly segregated as a sparse network, and that agents' numbers of same-group neighbours do not greatly exceed their desired numbers (i.e. they do not end up more segregated than they desire to be). Furthermore, we found that the network was very difficult to polarise when one group was somewhat smaller than the other, and that the network became unstable when one group was extremely small; both phenomena may help explain the complexity of real-world polarisation dynamics, such as unique risks faced by very small group sin a society. Finally we tested Fossett's (2006) "paradox of weak minority preferences", a well-established result in grid- and map-based models which shows that an increase in the minority group's desire for same-group neighbours can create more segregation than a similar increase for the majority group. In a densely connected social network, we find that the evidence for this effect is mixed.</description>

      <title>The Innovative Distinctiveness of Prizewinners and their Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena. Yet, in practice prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent even as prizes proliferate widely. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched non-prizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic's historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched non-prizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners' papers become more innovative than their matched peers, a difference that widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to non-prizewinners, prizewinners' collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The implications of the findings for the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.</description>

      <title>Drivers of cooperation in social dilemmas on higher-order networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding cooperation in social dilemmas requires models that capture the complexity of real-world interactions. While network frameworks have provided valuable insights to model the evolution of cooperation, they are unable to encode group interactions properly. Here, we introduce a general higher-order network framework for multi-player games on structured populations. Our model considers multi-dimensional strategies, based on the observation that social behaviours are affected by the size of the group interaction. We investigate dynamical and structural coupling between different orders of interactions, revealing the crucial role of nested multilevel interactions, and showing how such features can enhance cooperation beyond the limit of traditional models with uni-dimensional strategies. Our work identifies the key drivers promoting cooperative behaviour commonly observed in real-world group social dilemmas.</description>

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data from the public Internet has enhanced data usage efficiency in large language model (LLM) training. However, the potential threat of model collapse remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies primarily examine model collapse in a single model setting or rely solely on statistical surrogates. In this work, we introduce LLM Web Dynamics (LWD), an efficient framework for investigating model collapse at the network level. By simulating the Internet with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) database, we analyze the convergence pattern of model outputs. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for this convergence by drawing an analogy to interacting Gaussian Mixture Models.</description>
