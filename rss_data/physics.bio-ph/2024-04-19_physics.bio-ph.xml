      <title>Investigating the Molecular Design Mechanism Behind the Hydrophobicity of Biological Surface Nanostructures: Insights from Butterfly and Mosquito Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wettability is a fundamental physicochemical property of solid surfaces, with unique wettability patterns playing pivotal roles across diverse domains. Inspired by nature's ingenious designs, bio-inspired materials have emerged as a frontier of scientific inquiry. They showcase remarkable hydrophobic properties observed in phenomena such as mosquitoes preventing fog condensation, and lotus leaves exhibiting self-cleaning attributes. This groundbreaking research delves into the hydrophobic characteristics of biomimetic surfaces using coarse-grained molecular simulation and the free energy barrier evaluation system. By analyzing the butterfly wings and mosquito eyes model, we aim to pioneer a comprehensive framework that factors in the influence of surface parameters on the free energy barrier. Through meticulous simulation and analysis, we strive to validate and enhance the reliability of the free energy barrier assessment method, deepening our understanding of hydrophobicity across diverse biomaterials and paving the way for optimizing their properties for a myriad of applications. During our investigation, we shed light on the elusive intermediate state, a departure from the typical Cassie or Wenzel state, enriching our theoretical framework for surfaces with distinctive properties. This research is a catalyst for developing biomimetic materials with superior hydrophobic characteristics and innovative fabrication processes, transcending academic boundaries and promising significant strides in environmental conservation, medicine, and beyond, offering hope for a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>The light quantum mechanism of PCR efficiency oscillation with gold nanoparticle concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread application of nanomaterials in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has opened new avenues for improving detection methods in the biomedical field. Recent experiments (Chem. Eur. J. 2023, e202203513) have revealed oscillatory behavior between PCR efficiency and the concentration of gold nanoparticles in the pM range, potentially linked to the long-range Coulomb interactions among charged colloidal particles and the quantum size effect of nanoparticle electronic states. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that the radial distribution function of gold nanoparticles in solution gradually exhibits peak characteristics with increasing charge, triggering coherent photon behavior in Rayleigh scattering within the solution, thereby influencing the efficiency of reusing released photons in the PCR chain reaction. The study demonstrates that the oscillation period aligns with the wavelength of downstream reaction photons, while their energy matches the width of energy levels near the Fermi level of gold nanoparticles. The latter can absorb and store electron states internally, promoting upstream PCR reactions through subsequent re-release, and compensating for energy deficiencies through the Boltzmann distribution of electrons. This work is poised to advance the application of PCR-specific precise detection methods in the field of quantum biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Binding of $TMPyP^{3+}$ porphyrin to poly(A)-poly(U) polynucleotide: a spectroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The porphyrins are macrocyclic compounds widely used as photosensitizers in anticancer photodynamic therapy. The binding of a tricationic meso-tris(N-methylpyridinium)-porphyrin, $TMPyP^{3+}$, to poly(A)-poly(U) polynucleotide has been studied in neutral buffered solution, pH6.9, of low and near-physiological ionic strength in a wide range of molar phosphate-to-dye ratios (P/D). Effective $TMPyP^{3+}$ binding to the biopolymer was established using absorption spectroscopy, polarized fluorescence, fluorimetric titration and resonance light scattering. We propose a model in which $TMPyP^{3+}$ binds to the polynucleotide in two competitive binding modes: at low P/D ratios (&lt; 4) external binding of the porphyrin to polynucleotide backbone without self-stacking dominates, and at higher P/D (&gt; 30) the partially stacked porphyrin J-dimers are embedded into the polymer groove. Enhancement of the porphyrin emission was observed upon binding in all P/D range, contrasting the binding of this porphyrin to poly(G)-poly(C) with significant quenching of the porphyrin fluorescence at low P/D ratios. This observation indicates that $TMPyP^{3+}$ can discriminate between poly(A)-poly(U) and poly(G)-poly(C) polynucleotides at low P/D ratios. Formation of highly scattering extended porphyrin aggregates was observed near the stoichiometric in charge binding ratio, P/D = 3. It was revealed that the efficiency of the porphyrin external binding and aggregation is reduced in the solution of near-physiological ionic strength.</description>

      <title>Analysis of blurring due to short T2 decay at different resolutions in 23Na MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear magnetic resonance signal from sodium (23Na) nuclei demonstrates a fast bi-exponential T2 decay in biological tissues (T2,short = 0.5-5 ms and T2,long = 10-30 ms). Hence, blurring observed in sodium images acquired with center-out sequences is generally assumed to be dominated by signal attenuation at higher k-space frequencies. Most of the studies in the field primarily focus on the impact of readout duration on blurring but neglect the impact of resolution. In this paper, we examine the blurring effect of short T2 on images at different resolutions. A series of simulations, as well as phantom and in vivo scans were performed at varying resolutions and readout durations in order to evaluate progressive changes in image quality. We demonstrate that, given a fixed readout duration, T2 decay produces distinct blurring effects at different resolutions. Therefore, in addition to voxel size-dependent partial volume effects, the choice of resolution adds additional T2-dependent blurring.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton super-resolution imaging via virtual structured illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence imaging in thick biological tissues is challenging due to sample-induced aberration and scattering, which leads to severe degradation of image quality and resolution. Fluorescence imaging in reflection geometry further exacerbates this issue since the point spread function is distorted in both excitation and emission pathways. Here, we propose a novel approach termed adaptive optics virtual structured illumination microscopy (AO V-SIM) that enables super-resolution multiphoton imaging through a scattering medium in reflection geometry. Our approach exploits the incoherent reflection matrix obtained using a conventional point-scanning fluorescence microscope with an array detector. We introduce V-SIM super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on the incoherent reflection matrix. Furthermore, we introduce a software adaptive optics correction algorithm, AO V-SIM, which recovers unattenuated and phase-corrected optical transfer function for both excitation and emission pathways. The effectiveness of our proposed method is experimentally validated through sub-diffraction-limited two-photon fluorescence imaging of various samples in the presence of strong aberration.</description>

      <title>Deep and Dynamic Metabolic and Structural Imaging in Living Tissues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label-free imaging through two-photon autofluorescence (2PAF) of NAD(P)H allows for non-destructive and high-resolution visualization of cellular activities in living systems. However, its application to thick tissues and organoids has been restricted by its limited penetration depth within 300 $\mu$m, largely due to tissue scattering at the typical excitation wavelength (~750 nm) required for NAD(P)H. Here, we demonstrate that the imaging depth for NAD(P)H can be extended to over 700 $\mu$m in living engineered human multicellular microtissues by adopting multimode fiber (MMF)-based low-repetition-rate high-peak-power three-photon (3P) excitation of NAD(P)H at 1100 nm. This is achieved by having over 0.5 MW peak power at the band of 1100$\pm$25 nm through adaptively modulating multimodal nonlinear pulse propagation with a compact fiber shaper. Moreover, the 8-fold increase in pulse energy at 1100 nm enables faster imaging of monocyte behaviors in the living multicellular models. These results represent a significant advance for deep and dynamic metabolic and structural imaging of intact living biosystems. The modular design (MMF with a slip-on fiber shaper) is anticipated to allow wide adoption of this methodology for demanding in vivo and in vitro imaging applications, including cancer research, autoimmune diseases, and tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>KnotResolver: Tracking self-intersecting filaments in microscopy using directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantification of microscopy time-series of in vitro reconstituted motor driven microtubule (MT) transport in 'gliding assays' is typically performed using computational object tracking tools. However, these are limited to non-intersecting and rod-like filaments. Here, we describe a novel computational image-analysis pipeline, KnotResolver, to track image time-series of highly curved self-intersecting looped filaments (knots) by resolving cross-overs. The code integrates filament segmentation and cross-over or 'knot' identification based on directed graph representation, where nodes represent cross-overs and edges represent the path connecting them. The graphs are mapped back to contours and the distance to a reference minimized. We demonstrate the utility of the tool by segmentation and tracking MTs from experiments with dynein-driven wave like filament looping. The accuracy of contour detection is sub-pixel accuracy, and Dice scores indicate a robustness to noise, better than currently used tools. Thus KnotResolver overcomes multiple limitations of widely used tools in microscopy of cytoskeletal filament-like structures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion and effective shear modulus in a semi-solid membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of physical properties, the cell membrane is an exotic two-dimensional material that has a dual nature: it exhibits characteristics of fluids, i.e., lipid molecules show lateral diffusion, while also demonstrating properties of solids, evidenced by a non-zero shear modulus. We construct a model for such a $\textit{semi-solid}$ $\textit{membrane}$. Our model is a fluctuating randomly triangulated mesh with two different kinds of nodes. The solid nodes never change their neighbors, while the fluid nodes do. As the area fraction occupied by the solid nodes ($\Phi$) is increased the motion of fluid nodes transition from diffusion to localization via subdiffusion. Next, the solid nodes are pinned to mimic the pinning of the plasma membrane to the cytoskeleton. For the pinned membrane, there exists a range of $\Phi$ over which the model has both a non-zero shear modulus and a non-zero lateral diffusivity. The bending modulus, measured through the spectrum of height fluctuations remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Emergence of homochirality via template-directed ligation in an RNA reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RNA in extant biological systems is homochiral; it consists exclusively of D-ribonucleotides rather than L-ribonucleotides. How the homochirality of RNA emerged is not known. Here, we use stochastic simulations to quantitatively explore the conditions for RNA homochirality to emerge in the prebiotic scenario of an RNA reactor, in which RNA strands react in a non-equilibrium environment. These reactions include the hybridization, dehybridization, template-directed ligation, and cleavage of RNA strands. The RNA reactor is either closed, with a finite pool of ribonucleotide monomers of both chiralities (D and L), or the reactor is open, with a constant inflow of a racemic mixture of monomers. For the closed reactor, we also consider the interconversion between D and L monomers via a racemization reaction. We first show that template-free polymerization is unable to reach a high degree of homochirality, due to the lack of autocatalytic amplification. In contrast, in the presence of template-directed ligation, with base pairing and stacking between bases of the same chirality thermodynamically favored, a high degree of homochirality can arise and be maintained, provided the non equilibrium environment overcomes product inhibition, for instance via temperature cycling. Furthermore, if the experimentally observed kinetic stalling of ligation after chiral mismatches is also incorporated, the RNA reactor can evolve towards a fully homochiral state, in which one chirality is entirely lost. This is possible because the kinetic stalling after chiral mismatches effectively implements a chiral cross-inhibition process. Taken together, our model supports a scenario where the emergence of homochirality is assisted by template-directed ligation and polymerization in a non equilibrium RNA reactor.</description>

      <title>Can exact scaling exponents be obtained using the renormalization group? Affirmative evidence from incompressible polar active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In active matter systems, non-Gaussian, exact scaling exponents have been claimed in a range of systems using perturbative renormalization group (RG) methods. This is unusual compared to equilibrium systems where non-Gaussian exponents can typically only be approximated, even using the exact (or functional/nonperturbative) renormalization group (ERG). Here, we perform an ERG analysis on the ordered phase of incompressible polar active fluids and find that the exact non-Gaussian exponents obtained previously using a perturbative RG method remain valid even in this nonperturbative setting. Furthermore, our ERG analysis elucidates the RG flow of this system and enables us to identify an active Goldstone regime with nontrivial, long-ranged scaling behavior for parallel and longitudinal fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13253v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water molecules confined between biological membranes exhibit a distinctive non-Gaussian displacement distribution, far different from bulk water. Here, we introduce a new transport equation for water molecules in the intermembrane space, quantitatively explaining molecular dynamics simulation results. We find the unique transport dynamics of water molecules stems from the lateral diffusion coefficient fluctuation caused by their longitudinal motion. We also identify an interfacial region where water possesses distinct physical properties, unaffected by changes in the intermembrane separation.</description>
