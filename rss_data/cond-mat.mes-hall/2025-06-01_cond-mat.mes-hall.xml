      <title>Long-range spin transport in asymmetric quadruple quantum dots configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate long-range coherent charge transport in linear quadruple quantum dot (QQD) arrays under reduced symmetry configurations. Employing a master equation approach, we identify precise resonant conditions that enable minimal occupation of intermediate dots, thereby facilitating long-range transfer between distant sites. Our results highlight the critical role of parameter asymmetry and coherent tunneling mechanisms in achieving efficient quantum state transfer.</description>

      <title>Strained 2D TMD lateral heterojunctions via grayscale thermal-Scanning Probe Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale tailoring of the optoelectronic response of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides semiconductor layers (TMDs) has been achieved thanks to a novel strain engineering approach based on the grayscale thermal-Scanning Probe Lithography (t-SPL). This method allows the maskless nanofabrication of locally strained 2D MoS2-Au lateral heterojunction nanoarrays that are characterized by asymmetric electrical behavior. 2D MoS2 layers are conformally transferred onto grayscale t-SPL templates characterized by periodic nanoarrays of deterministic faceted nanoridges. This peculiar morphology induces asymmetric and uniaxial strain accumulation in the 2D TMD material allowing to tailor their electrical work-function at the nanoscale level, as demonstrated by Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). The modulation of the electronic response has been exploited to develop periodic nanoarrays of lateral heterojunctions endowed with asymmetric electrical response by simple maskless deposition of Au nanocontacts onto the strained 2D TMD layers. The locally strained Au-MoS2 layers show asymmetric lateral heterojunctions with engineered carrier extraction functionalities, thus representing a promising platform in view of tunable ultrathin nanoelectronic, nanophotonic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Relaxation pathways and emergence of domains in square artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-domain states of square artificial spin ice show a range of different morphologies ranging from simple stripe-like domains to more organically shaped coral domains. To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such diverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of individual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward its ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the emergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field barrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation of ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral barrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the emergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation towards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that intrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of extrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can subtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent mesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the evolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects.</description>

      <title>Zener tunnelling in biased bilayer graphene via analytic continuation of semiclassical theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing a semiclassical method based on analytic continuation, we compute the electron-hole pair production rate in biased bilayer graphene subject to an in-plane electric field. This approach, originally due to Zwaan, bypasses the need for exact solutions at turning points, which are generally unavailable beyond linear or quadratic band structures. Applying this technique to biased bilayer graphene reveals non-standard features of the asymptotic wavefunctions, in particular the necessity of retaining decaying components even in classically allowed regions. By providing a fully analytic solution, this work complements and clarifies earlier results based on hybrid analytical-numerical treatments, and importantly establishes the absolute normalisation of the pair production rate -- and hence of the tunnelling current.</description>

      <title>NbTiN Nanowire Resonators for Spin-Photon Coupling on Solid Neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrons floating on a solid neon exhibit long charge coherence times, making them attractive for hybrid quantum systems. When combined with high-quality, high-impedance superconducting resonators and a local magnetic field gradient, this platform enables strong charge-photon and spin-charge coupling -- key ingredients for scalable spin qubit architectures. In this work, we fabricated NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators and measured internal quality factors around $10^5$. We successfully deposited several hundred-nanometer-thick layers of solid neon, followed by gradual electron loading. The presence of neon and electrons was confirmed via resonance frequency shifts without degradation of the resonator's quality factor. These results demonstrate that NbTiN superconducting nanowire resonators are compatible with electrons-on-neon systems and suitable for future qubit experiments. We further performed a theoretical analysis of optimized micro-magnet configurations, showing that spin qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.99% for single-qubit and 99.9% for two-qubit operations are achievable using natural neon at the charge sweet spot.</description>

      <title>Universal Phase Transitions of Matter Induced in Optically Driven Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical cavities have been widely applied to manipulate the properties of solid state materials inside it. We propose that in systems embedded within optical cavities driven by incident pump light, the pump induces generic phase transitions into new non-equilibrium steady states. This effect arises from the ponderomotive potential, the effective static potential exerted by the pump on the low energy degrees of freedom, which exhibits a universal step-like structure that pushes the matter degrees of freedom in the direction that red-shifts the cavity photon modes. For a two dimensional electron liquid in a driven cavity, this step-like potential pushes the electron density to jump to a smaller value so that a hybrid cavity photon mode is red shifted to slightly below the pump frequency. Similarly, for a disordered superconductor in such a driven cavity, this potential acts on the superconducting order parameter and causes a first order phase transition to a new steady state with a smaller gap. By realistic electromagnetic modeling of the cavity, we construct the non-equilibrium phase diagrams for experimentally relevant devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristics of discrete vibrational levels caused by a point three-parameter substitutional impurity in long linear chain of inert gas atoms adsorbed in groove on the surface of carbon nanobundle are studied. The impurity atom differs from the atoms of the chain in the following parameters: the mass, the parameter of interaction with neighboring atoms and the parameter of interaction with the substrate. Analytical expressions for the frequencies of the localized vibrations and the intensities of these vibrations are obtained. The conditions for the existence of localized vibrations both below and above the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum of the adsorbed chain are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermal near-field routing with the non-reciprocal Weyl semi-metal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate theoretically the non-reciprocal heating dynamics of two nanoparticles in the vicinity of a substrate all made of the ferromagnetic Weyl semi-metal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$. We show that the thermal routing effect is due to a spin-spin coupling mechanism between the nanoparticle resonances and the non-reciprocal surface modes of the substrate. Our numerical results indicate that the non-reciprocal heating effect is on the order of 22.5% of the applied temperature differences. This strong rounting effect paves the way for first experimental realizations employing Weyl semi-metals and applications in nanoscale thermal management.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in harnessing non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Ready Microwave Detection with Scalable Graphene Bolometers in the Strong Localization Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting quantum interference of charge carriers, epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide emerges as a game-changing platform for ultra-sensitive bolometric sensing, featuring an intrinsic resistive thermometer response unmatched by any other graphene variant. By achieving low and uniform carrier densities, we have accessed a new regime of strong charge localization that dramatically reduces thermal conductance, significantly enhancing bolometer performance. Here we present scalable graphene-based bolometers engineered for detecting GHz-range photons, a frequency domain essential for superconducting quantum processors. Our devices deliver a state-of-the-art noise equivalent power of 40 zW$/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ at $T=40~$mK, enabled by the steep temperature dependence of thermal conductance, $G_{\rm th}\sim T^4$ for $T&lt;100~$mK. These results establish epitaxial graphene bolometers as versatile and low-back-action detectors, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation quantum processors and pioneering investigations into the thermodynamics and thermalization pathways of strongly entangled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Weak localization as probe of spin-orbit-induced spin-split bands in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity coupling of bilayer graphene (BLG) to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a promising route to engineer gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) while preserving BLG's exceptional electronic properties. This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent transport through edge states in 2D semi-Dirac materials with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and band inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk-boundary correspondence in two-dimensional type-I semi-Dirac materials with band inversion and Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Employing a dimensional reduction framework, we identify the Zak phase along the quadratically dispersing direction as a topological invariant that captures the presence of edge states. In the non-trivial topological regime, systems with finite width exhibit energy-dependent edge states that are topologically protected only at specific momenta. At kx equal to zero, symmetry-protected edge states emerge, analogous to the Rashba-free case. At finite kx, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and band structure gives rise to spin-dependent edge states, localized on specific edges based on its spin and particle-hole character. We compute spin-resolved conductance through these edge channels and observe robust, tunable oscillations attributable to spin precession induced by the effective Rashba magnetic field. These results reveal how spin-orbit interactions enrich the edge physics of semi-Dirac systems and provide a platform for spintronic control in anisotropic topological materials.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Prediction of the Effect of Neutron Irradiation on the Ductile-to-Brittle Transition in Fe-Ni-Cr Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fracture behavior of irradiated Fe-Ni-Cr alloys, focusing on the radiation-induced ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT). Unlike the commonly studied temperature-driven DBT, this transition is driven by radiation-induced defects, which impede dislocation motion and reduce the material's capacity for plastic deformation, ultimately leading to brittle failure. Utilizing Molecular Dynamics simulations, this work examines the interaction between radiation-induced defects, such as dislocation loops and voids, and their influence on crack propagation and energy dissipation mechanisms. The results reveal distinct roles played by these defects: voids facilitate crack growth by reducing local cohesive energy, while dislocation loops act as barriers that impede crack advancement and redirect crack paths, significantly altering crack morphology. Building on the classical approach of separating fracture energy into brittle cleavage and plastic components, this study adapts this decomposition to irradiated materials. This approach appraises the distinct roles of surface energy and plastic work across varying radiation damage levels, providing critical insights into how irradiation-induced defects govern fracture dynamics.</description>

      <title>All-optical mapping of ultrafast carrier dynamics in a Dirac semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG), the hallmark effect of attosecond science, is a nonperturbative nonlinear process leading to the emission of high harmonic light from gases and solids. In gases, extreme driving laser pulse intensities can deplete the ground state, suppressing harmonic emission during the trailing edge of the pulse. Here, we report pronounced ultrafast depletion dynamics during HHG in a gapless Dirac semimetal -- highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Remarkably, HOPG supports nonperturbative harmonic generation at laser intensities as low as $10^{10}$ W cm$^{-2}$, facilitated by its vanishing bandgap. Using two-color spectroscopy, we reveal the excitation dynamics of Dirac electron-hole pairs as it affects the emission of harmonics during the presence of the driving laser pulse. Notably, valence band depletion near the Dirac points leads to a marked suppression of interband harmonics and induces measurable temporal shifts. These observations are supported by simulations based on semiconductor Bloch equations. Our findings uncover a new regime of strong-field light-matter interaction in gapless solids and establish HHG as a sensitive, all-optical probe of ultrafast carrier dynamics, offering new opportunities for ultrafast optoelectronics in Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Probing quasiparticle excitations in a doped Mott insulator via Friedel oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate impurity-induced Friedel oscillations in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model, focusing on the role of holon and doublon excitations. We show that weak impurities, due to the non-fermionic nature of the underlying quasiparticles, induce Friedel oscillations whose behavior is consistent with an effective non-interacting theory for these quasiparticles, and whose wavevector reflects the violation of Luttinger's theorem. At larger impurity strength, the system transitions to a phase-separated state composed of coexisting Mott-insulating (half-filled) and hole-rich regions. Within the composite operator framework, this phase separation arises from a competition between the kinetic energy of holons and the tendency to form tightly bound holon-doublon pairs. Our results offer new insights into the nature of charge carriers and the emergent electronic phases in the doped Mott regime.</description>

      <title>Frustrated vacancy ordering creates novel quantum properties in Kutinaite, $\mathrm{Ag}_{6}\mathrm{Cu}_{14.4}\mathrm{As}_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ideal crystals are fully ordered, but real-world crystals always contain defects breaking translational symmetry. Random defects in crystals have important implications and they e.g. provide the foundation for semiconductor-based electronic devices. Structurally correlated defects introduce an additional level of complexity, which may lead to novel materials properties, but rationalization of relations between correlated disorder and the emergent material properties are very rare. Here we report that the defect structure of the mineral Kutinaite, Ag6Cu14.4As7, exhibits unprecedented metallic diamagnetism, a hallmark of non-trivial electronic states that require delicate symmetrical protection. Using a combination of X-ray scattering methodologies, simulations, and physical property measurements, we deduced and verified subtle frustrated vacancy ordering of the Cu sublattice when cooling crystals below ~300 K. The vacancy frustration in Kutinaite leads to unique quantum properties, and our study calls for a reconsideration of the role of vacancies as quasi-chemical species in crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly monolayer MoS2, have received increased attention in materials science and have been exploited in diverse applications from photonics to catalysis. Defects in TMDs play a crucial role in modulating their properties, and understanding defect-induced dynamics is of great importance. This study investigates the dynamics of sulfur depletion in defective monolayer MoS2, which yields stable MoS monolayers. Various defect sizes, temperature regimes, and substrate effects were investigated. Through comprehensive classical molecular (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, we elucidate the dynamics of sulfur vacancy formation in MoS2 lattices. After removing all sulfur atoms from the top layer, several sulfur atoms from the bottom layer spontaneously migrate to the top layer as a response to increase structural stability, thus creating a MoSx alloy. These findings deepen our understanding of defect dynamics in TMDs, offering valuable insights into the controlled engineering of their properties for nanotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Acoustics with Tunable Nonlinearity in the Superstrong Coupling Regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of mechanical modes in the quantum regime is a key resource for quantum technologies, offering promising pathways for quantum sensing with macroscopic systems and scalable architectures for quantum simulation. In this work, we realise a multimode mechanical cavity coupled to a superconducting Kerr resonator, which induces nonlinearity in the mechanical modes. The Kerr mode is realised by a flux-tunable SQUID array resonator, while the mechanical modes are implemented by a surface acoustic wave (SAW) cavity. Both mechanical and electromagnetic modes are individually addressable via dedicated measurement lines, enabling full spectroscopic characterisation. We introduce a straightforward protocol to measure the SQUID array resonator's participation ratio in the hybrid acoustic modes, quantifying the degree of hybridisation. The participation ratio reveals that our device operates at the onset of the multimode coupling regime, where multiple acoustic modes simultaneously interact with the nonlinear superconducting element. Furthermore, this platform allows controllable Kerr-type nonlinearities in multiple acoustic modes, with the participation ratio serving as the key parameter determining both the dissipation rates and nonlinear strengths of these hybridised modes. Close to the resonant regime, we measure a cross-Kerr interaction between seven pairs of mechanical modes, which is controllable via the SQUID array resonator detuning. These results establish a platform for engineering nonlinear multimode mechanical interactions, offering potential for future integration with superconducting qubits and implementation of multiple mechanical qubits.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Reciprocity in Orbital-Charge-Coupled Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupled transport of charge and orbital angular momentum (OAM) lies at the core of orbitronics. Here, we examine the reciprocal relation in orbital-charge-coupled transport in thin films, treating bulk and surface contributions on equal footing. We argue that the conventional definition of orbital current is ill-defiled, as it violates reciprocity due to the nonconservation of OAM. This issue is resolved by adopting the so-called \emph{proper} orbital current, which is directly linked to orbital accumulation. We establish the reciprocal relation for the \emph{global} (spatially integrated) response between orbital and charge currents, while showing that their \emph{local} (spatially resolved) responses can differ significantly. In particular, we find large surface contributions that may lead to nonreciprocity when currents are measured locally. These findings are supported by first-principles calculations on W(110) and Pt(111) thin films. In W(110), orbital-charge interconversion is strongly nonreciprocal at the layer level, despite exact reciprocity in the integrated response. Interestingly, spin-charge interconversion in W(110) remains nearly reciprocal even locally. In contrast, Pt(111) exhibits local nonreciprocity for both orbital-charge and spin-charge conversions, which we attribute to strong spin-orbit coupling. We propose that such local distinctions can be exploited to experimentally differentiate spin and orbital currents.</description>

Abstract: We report on a stable form of pulsed electroluminescence in a dopant-free direct bandgap semiconductor heterostructure which we coin the tidal effect. Swapping an inducing gate voltage in an ambipolar field effect transistor allows incoming and outgoing carriers of opposite charge to meet and recombine radiatively. We develop a model to explain the carrier dynamics that underpins the frequency response of the pulsed electroluminescence intensity. Higher mobilities enable larger active emission areas than previous reports, as well as stable emission over long timescales.</description>

Abstract: Kondo physics and heavy-fermion behavior have been predicted and observed in moir\'e materials. The electric tunability of moir\'e materials allows an in-situ study of Kondo lattices' phase diagrams, which is not possible with their intermetallic counterparts. However, moir\'e platforms rely on twisting, which introduces twisting angle disorder and undesired buckling. Here we propose device layouts for one- and two-dimensional gate-defined superlattices in Bernal bilayer graphene where localized states couple to dispersive valley-helical modes. 16We show that, under electronic interactions, these superlattices are described by an electrically-tunable Kondo-Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: The third-order anomalous Hall effect (TOAHE) driven by Berry connection polarizability in Dirac materials offers a promising avenue for exploring quantum geometric phenomena. We investigate the role of impurity scattering on TOAHE using the semiclassical Boltzmann framework, via a comparison of the intrinsic contributions (stemming from the Berry connection polarizability) with the extrinsic contributions caused by the disorder. To validate our theoretical findings, we employ a generalized two-dimensional low-energy Dirac model to analytically assess the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the TOAHE. Our analysis reveals distinct disorder-mediated effects, including skew-scattering and side-jump contributions. We also elucidate their intriguing dependencies on Fermi surface anisotropy and discuss opportunities for experimental exploration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field with the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. This expression is in disagreement with what was predicted in semi-classical scenarios, which neglect Landau quantization. We argue that the classical/quantum crossover occurs at accessible magnetic fields for states whose Fermi wave-vector is almost parallel to the magnetic field. As a consequence, the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement give rise to oscillations with a periodicity identical to the semi-classical one. A rigorous theoretical account of our data is missing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport with Spin Orbit Coupling: New Developments in TranSIESTA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of spinor quantum transport within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) code TranSIESTA based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). First-principles methods play an essential role in molecular and material modelling, and the DFT+NEGF approach has become a widely-used tool for quantum transport simulation. Exisiting (open source) DFT-based quantum transport codes either model non-equilibrium/finite-bias cases in an approximate way or rely on the collinear spin approximation. Our new implementation closes this gap and enables the TranSIESTA code to use full spinor-wave functions. Thereby it provides a method for transport simulation of topological materials and devices based on spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or non-collinear spins. These materials hold enormous potential for the development of ultra-low energy electronics urgently needed for the design of sustainable technology. The new feature is tested for relevant systems determining magnetoresistance in iron nanostructures and transport properties of a lateral transition metal dichalcogenide heterojunction.</description>

Abstract: The sound propagation properties resulting from a dynamical axion insulator generated from a Weyl semimetal are explored. Due to the axial electron-phonon coupling, the speed of sound in the material and its attenuation is seen to be modified. At the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) level, it is seen that the axion obstructs a stronger modification of the speed of sound for longitudinal waves propagating parallel to the Axionic Charge Density Wave (ACDW) wavevector but not for transverse waves. On the other hand, the attenuation is modified by effects beyond the RPA, but the axionic contribution is negligible. These effects can be probed in sound propagation experiments without invoking the axial anomaly, which would require an additional electric field. We also discuss the importance of axial electron-phonon interactions with respect to the more conventional vector interactions in these systems.</description>

Abstract: The quantum Rabi model exhibits a superradiant phase transition when the coupling becomes strong, even though it involves only two components: a two-level atom and a single bosonic mode. This phase transition is referred to as a finite-component quantum phase transition, in contrast to conventional phase transitions in many-body systems. In this Letter, we investigate heat transport across an atom embedded in bosonic modes, modeled by the quantum Rabi model, between two thermal baths. We found a manifestation of the superradiant phase transition in the thermal conductance, which represents the linear response to a temperature bias. Our Letter can be helpful for the development of quantum heat devices utilizing controllable finite-component quantum phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: Destructive quantum interference in molecular junctions might be used to build molecular quantum rulers, allowing to quantify changes in external control parameters electrically. For this reason, it is important to understand which patterns of destructive quantum interference can occur inside the electronic excitation gap of a molecule, coupled to conducting electrodes. By considering a four-level model, we show that much more complex destructive quantum interference behavior can arise than expected for just two levels. We classify the destructive quantum interferences analytically and show that they may even occur in regions forbidden by the standard orbital rule for electron transport. Our results suggest that appropriate molecular design may indeed allow to construct highly sensitive molecular quantum rulers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Preparing magnonic non-Gaussian states by adding a single magnon onto Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum magnonics based on YIG spheres provides a new arena for observing macroscopic quantum states. Here we propose to prepare two kinds of non-Gaussian magnonic states by adding a single magnon onto two Gaussian states, namely, coherent and thermal states. We adopt an optomagnonic system of a YIG sphere and use fast optical pulses to weakly activate the magnon-induced Stokes scattering. Conditioned on the detection of a polarized single photon, a single magnon can be added onto an initial Gaussian state. We use a microwave cavity to prepare an initial magnon coherent state and finally read out the generated single-magnon added coherent or thermal state. Both the non-Gaussian states of a magnon mode in a large-size YIG sphere are macroscopic quantum states, which exhibit many nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian statistics, quadrature squeezing, and a negative Wigner function. Further, both states show a smooth transition from a quantum state to a classical state by changing the coherent or thermal magnon excitations and thus can be used for the fundamental study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Local symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortex. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe$_2$ with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction of UTe$_2$ (crystallographic a axis). Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the depth of the superconducting gap and the coherence peak on the one side of the vortex core are stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Considering the distribution of the magnetic field in the vortex, this symmetry breaking is due to the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe$_2$ and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Low energy surface phonon dispersion of MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermal and electronic performance of atomically thin semiconductors, a promising group of materials for electronics, is underpinned by their vibrational (phonon) dynamics. However, surface phonons in layered materials remain poorly understood due to limitations in conventional experimental techniques. We employ helium-3 spin-echo (HeSE) spectroscopy to measure the lowest energy (&lt;10meV) dispersions of surface phonons on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a prototypical 2D semiconductor. We reveal that the widely studied E_2g and A_2u modes possess mixed acoustic-optical character, displaying unexpected quartic and quadratic dispersion relations, and finite-layer confinement to the surface of 4-5 and 6 layers, respectively. Crucially, we find no evidence of any pure acoustic mode at the surface of MoS2. This suppresses anharmonic phonon decay processes, thereby limiting thermal transport and providing a mechanistic explanation for poor thermal conductivity in few-layer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Minimal pole representation for spectral functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representing spectral densities, real-frequency, and real-time Green's functions of continuous systems by a small discrete set of complex poles is an ubiquitous problem in condensed matter physics, with applications ranging from quantum transport simulations to the simulation of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper introduces a method for obtaining a compact, approximate representation of these functions, based on their parameterization on the real axis and a given approximate precision. We show applications to typical spectral functions and results for structured and unstructured correlation functions of model systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>

      <title>Effect of crystallinity on spin-orbit torque in 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides provide an intriguing platform for generating an efficient spin current due to a unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on the effect of crystallinity on current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT) in binary 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$ thin films by controlling amorphous, polycrystalline, and epitaxial states. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and IrO$_{2}$, we find that dampinglike (DL) SOT is larger than fieldlike SOT for all the samples. We also demonstrate that both electrical resistivity and the DL SOT efficiency increase in order of epitaxial, polycrystalline, and amorphous IrO$_{2}$. Despite their different electrical conductivities, spin Hall conductivities of the three states of the IrO$_{2}$ layer are found to be nearly constant, which is consistent with the intrinsic regime of the spin Hall effect scaling relation. Our results highlight the important role that crystallinity plays in the spin-current generation, leading to the potential technological development of spintronic devices based on the 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>Modified Transfer Matrix Method for the Extraction of Material Properties via Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy is a powerful technique for extracting the low-frequency optical properties of materials. However, the optical constants are difficult to determine directly from the experimental transfer function, such that various numerical approximations must be implemented to describe specific conditions. Here, we introduce a modified Transfer Matrix Method that uses a genetic algorithm for optimization to determine the refractive index of materials in the THz regime. We show that this approach is generally applicable across a wide range of refractive indices, structures, and frequency ranges. Our method is intuitive and yields accurate results compared to leading methods across a wide spectral range (0.1 - 15 THz).</description>
