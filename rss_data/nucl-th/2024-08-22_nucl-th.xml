      <title>Semiclassical Features of Wobbling and Chiral Properties in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semiclassical approach is used to describe the wobbling and chiral motion in even-even and odd-even nuclei The trial function involved in the variational equation for the quantal action is a coherent state for the SU(2 ) group associated to a triaxial rotor for the case of an even-even system and a coherent state for the group SU(2)$\otimes$ SU(2) describing the particle-core system. Application is made for $^{158}$Er and $^{161, 163, 165,167}$Lu, ${135}$Pr. Th parameters involved in the coherent state expression are complex numbers depending on time and play the role of the phase space generalized conjugate coordinates whose equation of motion may be brought to the Hamilton canonical form.Within a harmonic approximation one analytically obtains the wobbling frequencies which are further used to calculate the excitation energies for the states forming a band. A new procedure to quantize the classical orbitals is proposed. In the new picture the electromagnetic transition probabilities are calculated both for the in-band and the intraband transitions. Additionally, for odd systems, some other observable like aligned angular momentum, excitation energies relative to a reference spectrum, dynamic moment of energies are calculated and compared with the corresponding experimental data.In the parameter space one identified several nuclear phases with specific properties. An example is given where the wobbling and chiral motions coexist. The existence of a transversal wobbling is widely commented. A new boson representation for the angular momenta is proposed. The approach was successfully applied to $^{135}$Pr. One concludes that semiclassical description is an efficient tool to account quantitatively for the wobbling and chiral properties in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Capture Rates of Highly Degenerate Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the low temperature and high density conditions of a neutron star crust neutrons are degenerate. In this work, we study the effect of this degeneracy on the capture rates of neutrons on neutron rich nuclei in accreted crusts. We use a statistical Hauser-Feshbach model to calculate neutron capture rates and find that neutron degeneracy can increase rates significantly. Changes increase from a factor of a few to many orders of magnitude near the neutron drip line. We also quantify uncertainties due to model inputs for masses, $\gamma$-strength functions, and level densities. We find that uncertainties increase dramatically away from stability and that degeneracy tends to increase these uncertainties further, except for cases near the neutron drip line where degeneracy leads to more robustness. As in the case of capture of classically distributed neutrons, variations in the mass model have the strongest impact. Corresponding variations in the reaction rates can be as high as 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, and be more than 5 times larger than under classical conditions. To ease the incorporation of neutron degeneracy in nucleosynthesis networks, we provide tabulated results of capture rates as well as analytical expressions as function of temperature and neutron chemical potential, for proton numbers between $3 \le Z \le 85$, derived from fits to our numerical results. Fits are based on a new parametrization that complements previously employed power law approximations with additional Lorentzian terms that account for low energy resonances, significantly improving accuracy.</description>

      <title>Towards a first principles light-front Hamiltonian for the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the nucleon's wave functions from the eigenstates of the light-front quantum chromodynamics Hamiltonian for the first time, using a fully relativistic and nonperturbative approach based on light-front quantization, without an explicit confining potential. These eigenstates are determined for the three-quark, three-quark-gluon, and three-quark-quark-antiquark Fock representations, making them suitable for low-resolution probes. From this, we calculate the nucleon's quark and gluon matter densities, helicity, and transversity distributions, which show qualitative consistency with experimental extractions. We also compute the contributions of quark and gluon helicity to the proton spin and the tensor charges. The obtained light-front wave functions represent a significant advancement towards a unified description of various hadron distribution functions in both longitudinal and transverse momentum space.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$ in an effective Lagrangian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most recent data on differential cross sections and photon beam asymmetries $\Sigma$ from the LEPS2/BGOegg Collaboration for the $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$ reaction are analyzed within a tree-level effective Lagrangian approach. The $t$-channel $\rho$ and $\omega$ exchanges, the $u$- and $s$-channel $N$ exchanges, the interaction current, and the possible $s$-channel $N^*$ exchanges are taken into account in constructing the reaction amplitudes to reproduce the data. The results show that the contributions from either the $N(2040)3/2^+$ or the $N(2100)1/2^+$ resonance exchange in the $s$ channel are necessarily required to describe the LEPS2/BGOegg data and they dominate the differential cross sections of $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$. Further analysis shows that the contributions from the $t$-channel $\rho$ and $\omega$ exchanges and the interaction current are rather small to both differential cross sections and photo beam asymmetries, and the contributions from $u$-channel $N$ exchange are considerable in the case of including $N(2040)3/2^+$ in the model while negligible in the case of including $N(2100)1/2^+$ in the model. Predictions of target asymmetries $T$ for $\gamma p \to f_0(980) p$ are given, which can be examined by future experiments.</description>

      <title>Second-order spin hydrodynamics from Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Zubarev's nonequilibrium statistical operator formalism, we derive the second-order dissipative tensors in relativistic spin hydrodynamics, {\em viz.} rotational stress tensor ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$), boost heat vector ($q_\mu$), shear stress tensor ($\pi_{\mu\nu}$) and bulk viscous pressure ($\Pi$). The first two ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$ and $q_\mu$) emerge due to the inclusion of the antisymmetric part in the energy-momentum tensor, which, in turn, governs the conservation of spin angular momentum ($\Sigma^{\alpha\mu\nu}$). As a result, new thermodynamic forces, generated due to the antisymmetric part of $T_{\mu \nu}$, contains the spin chemical potential. In this work, we have also taken the spin density ($S^{\mu \nu}$) as an independent thermodynamic variable, in addition to the energy density and particle density, thereby resulting in an additional transport coefficient given by the correlation between $S^{\mu \nu}$ and $\tau^{\mu \nu}$. The newly found terms in $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Pi$ are the artifacts of the new thermodynamic forces that arise due to the antisymmetric part of $T^{\mu \nu}$. Finally we have derived the evolution equations for the aforesaid tensors - $\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $q_\mu$, $\pi_{\mu\nu}$, and $\Pi$.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of doubly charmed and bottom baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have investigated the strong decays for low-lying excited states of doubly charmed and bottom baryons in the constituent quark model. Our results indicate that some $\lambda-$mode $\Xi_{cc/bb}(1P)$ and $\Omega_{cc/bb}(1P)$ states are relatively narrow, which are very likely to be discovered by future experiments. The light meson emissions for the low-lying $\rho-$mode states are highly suppressed due to the orthogonality of wave functions between initial and final states. Moreover, the strong decay behaviors for doubly charmed and bottom baryons preserve the heavy superflavor symmetry well, where the small violation originates from the finite heavy quark masses and different phase spaces. We hope that present theoretical results for undiscovered doubly charmed and bottom baryons can provide helpful information for future experiments and help us better understand the heavy quark symmetry.</description>

      <title>How the QCD trace anomaly behaves at the core of twin stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dense and cold (normalized) QCD trace anomaly, $\Delta$, in the interior of twin neutron stars (obtained from several sets of equations of state in agreement with modern compact-star and multimessenger data) satisfying static and dynamic stability conditions. We scan this parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence of a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by means of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\Delta$ suffers an abrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative values ($\Delta\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing out a smooth behavior with $\Delta\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we characterize the behavior of conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in twin stars for which we perform comparisons with theoretical constraints, e.g. from Bayesian studies adjusted to agree with pQCD. All this allows us to infer and hypothesize modifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong thermodynamic discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Trineutron resonances in the SS-HORSE-NCSM approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SS-HORSE-NCSM method is generalized to the case of democratic decay into an odd number of fragments. This method is applied to the search for resonances in three-neutron system (trineutron) using ab initio No-Core Shell Model calculations with realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. The $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ strongly overlapping resonances are predicted when softened $NN$ interactions are used and are preferred over the case where bare $NN$ interactions of the chiral effective field theory are used with no resonance obtained.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of the dense matter equation of state built upon extended Skyrme interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-relativistic model of nuclear matter with Brussels extended Skyrme interactions is employed in order to build, within a Bayesian approach, models for the dense matter equation of state (EOS). In addition to a minimal set of constraints on nuclear empirical parameters; the density behavior of the energy per particle in pure neutron matter (PNM); a lower limit on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, we require that the Fermi velocity of neutrons ($v_{\mathrm{F;\,n}}$) in PNM and symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) with densities up to $0.8~\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$ (arbitrary) does not exceed the speed of light. The latter condition is imposed in order to cure a deficiency present in many Skyrme interactions [Duan and Urban, Phys. Rev. C 108, 025813 (2023)]. We illustrate the importance of this constraint for the posterior distributions. Some of our models are subjected to constraints on the density dependence of neutron (nucleon) Landau effective mass in PNM (SNM), too. The impact of various sets of constraints on the behaviors of nuclear matter and NSs is discussed in detail. Systematic comparison with results previously obtained by employing Skyrme interactions is done for posteriors of both nuclear matter (NM) and NS parameters. Special attention is given to the model and constraints dependence of correlations among various quantities.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological model for $\gamma\gamma^* \to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ constraining the $f_1(1420)$ transition form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of the $\gamma\gamma^*\to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ process by including the $s$-channel production of the $\eta(1475)$ and $f_1(1420)$ resonances. The non-resonant channel via $K$- and $K^*$-exchanges is investigated carefully by performing the Lorentz tensor decomposition and is constructed to yield a correct high-energy Regge behavior. The transition form factor of $f_1(1420)$ is adjusted to achieve a reasonable description of the existing L3 data in the $f_1(1420)$ resonance region. This model is intended to serve as a Monte Carlo generator for the analysis currently being performed by the BESIII Collaboration. We also estimate the polarized $\gamma\gamma^*\to K\bar{K}^*(892)$ cross sections and demonstrate how to extract the transition form factors of $f_1(1420)$ from the polarized cross sections.</description>

Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of isolated three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large scattering length.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than standard energy estimators, which are related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in standard energy estimators.</description>
