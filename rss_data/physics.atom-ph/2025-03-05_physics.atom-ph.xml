      <title>Structural Transitions and Melting of Two-Dimensional Ion Crystals in RF Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural properties and melting behavior of two-dimensional ion crystals in an RF trap, focusing on the effects of ion temperature and trap potential symmetry. We identify distinct crystal structures that form under varying trapping conditions and temperatures through experimental observations and theoretical analyses. As the temperature increases or the trap potential becomes more symmetric, we observe a transition from a lattice arrangement to elongated ring-like formations aligned along the trap axes. Our experimental and theoretical efforts enhance our understanding of phase transitions in low-dimensional, confined systems, offering insights into the controlled formation of quantum crystals for applications in quantum simulations and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Electric field dependent g factors of ThF$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The g-factors for $J = 1$, $F=3/2$, $|M_F|=3/2$ hyperfine levels of the ground electronic state $^3\Delta_1$ of the $^{232}$ThF$^+$ cation are calculated as functions of the external electric field. These calculations are necessary for the analysis of systematic effects in the experiment aimed at searching for the electron electric dipole moment.</description>

      <title>Large inverse Faraday effect for Rydberg states of free atoms and isolated donors in semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the induction of magnetization in Rydberg systems by means of the inverse Faraday effect, and propose the appearance of the effect in two such systems, Rydberg atoms proper and shallow dopants in semiconductors. Rydberg atoms are characterized by a large orbital radius. This large radius gives such excited states a large angular moment, which when driven with circularly polarized light, translates to a large effective magnetic field ${B}_{\text{eff}}$. We calculate this effect to generate effective magnetic fields of $O(1\,\mu\text{T})\times\left( \frac{\omega}{1\,\text{THz}} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{I}{10\,\text{W cm}^{-2}} \right) n^4$ in the Rydberg states of atoms such as Rb and Cs for off-resonant photon beams with frequency omega and intensity ${I}$ expressed in units of the denominators and $n$ the principal quantum number. Additionally, terahertz spectroscopy of phosphorus doped silicon reveals a large cross-section for excitation of shallow dopants to Rydberg-like states, which even for small $n$ have the potential to be driven similarly with circularly polarized light to produce an even larger magnetization. Our theoretical calculations estimate ${B}_{\text{eff}}$ as $O(10^2\,\text{T})$ for Si:P with a beam intensity of $10^8\,\text{W cm}^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Frequency Shift Caused by Nonuniform Field and Boundary Relaxation in Magnetic Resonance and Comagnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In magnetic resonance experiments, it is widely recognized that a nonuniform magnetic field can lead to an increase in the resonance line width, as well as a reduction in sensitivity and spectral resolution. However, a nonuniform magnetic field can also cause shifts in resonance frequency, which has received far less attention. In this work, we investigate the frequency shift caused by boundary relaxation and nonuniform magnetic field with arbitrary spatial distribution. We find that this frequency shift is spin-species dependent, implying a systematic error in NMR gyroscope and comagnetometers. The first order correction to this systematic error is proportional to the difference of boundary relaxation rate, and dominates for small cells. In contrast, the third and higher order corrections arise from the difference of gyromagnetic ratios of spin species, and dominates for large cells. This insight helps understanding the unexplained isotope shifts in recent NMR gyroscope and new physics searching experiments that utilize comagnetometers. Finally, we propose a tool for wall interaction research based on the frequency shift's dependency on boundary relaxation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamical interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such a setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the dynamical interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization dynamics. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.</description>
