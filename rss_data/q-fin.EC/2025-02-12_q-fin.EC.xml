      <title>The Future of Work and Capital: Analyzing AGI in a CES Production Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) into economic production represents a transformative shift with profound implications for labor markets, income distribution, and technological growth. This study extends the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function to incorporate AGI-driven labor and capital alongside traditional inputs, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing AGI's economic impact.
  Four key models emerge from this framework. First, we examine the substitution and complementarity between AGI labor and human labor, identifying conditions under which AGI augments or displaces human workers. Second, we analyze how AGI capital accumulation influences wage structures and income distribution, highlighting potential disruptions to labor-based earnings. Third, we explore long-run equilibrium dynamics, demonstrating how an economy dominated by AGI capital may lead to the collapse of human wages and necessitate redistributive mechanisms. Finally, we assess the impact of AGI on total factor productivity, showing that technological growth depends on whether AGI serves as a complement to or a substitute for human labor.
  Our findings underscore the urgent need for policy interventions to ensure economic stability and equitable wealth distribution in an AGI-driven economy. Without appropriate regulatory measures, rising inequality and weakened aggregate demand could lead to economic stagnation despite technological advancements. Moreover this research suggests a renegoation of the Social Contract.</description>

      <title>Artificial General Intelligence and the End of Human Employment: The Need to Renegotiate the Social Contract</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) labor, including AI agents and autonomous systems operating at near-zero marginal cost, reduces the marginal productivity of human labor, ultimately pushing wages toward zero. As AGI labor and capital replace human workers, economic power shifts to capital owners, resulting in extreme wealth concentration, rising inequality, and reduced social mobility. The collapse of human wages causes aggregate demand to deteriorate, creating a paradox where firms produce more using AGI, yet fewer consumers can afford to buy goods. To prevent economic and social instability, new economic structures must emerge, such as Universal Basic Income (UBI), which redistributes AGI-generated wealth, public or cooperative AGI ownership, ensuring broader access to AI-driven profits, and progressive AGI capital taxation, which mitigates inequality and sustains aggregate demand. Addressing these challenges in form of renegotiation the Social Contract is crucial to maintaining economic stability in a post-labor economy.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fishing: The Value of Maritime Cultural Heritage in Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of maritime heritage in providing benefits such as a sense of place and identity has been widely discussed. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive quantitative analysis, particularly regarding monetary valuation and its impact on people's preferences. In this study, I present the results of a choice experiment that assesses the value of the maritime cultural heritage associated with shrimp fishing through seafood consumption preferences in Germany. Additionally, I investigate people's attitudes toward cultural heritage and examine how these attitudes affect their stated preferences. I find that these attitudes are significantly stronger in towns where local fishermen led a prominent awareness campaign on fishing culture during the study period. Moreover, I observe a positive willingness to pay for a cultural heritage attribute in shrimp dishes, which varies depending on individuals' attitudes toward cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Quantify Adaptation to Multiple Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an analytical framework to assess the adaptations in a coupled ecological-economic system and apply it to a bio-economic model. Our framework allows us to quantify the impact of multiple drivers on a coupled ecological-economic system, while distinguishing between adaptation and sensitivities to positive and negative exposures. This distinction allows us to differentiate between drivers that improve and decrease well-being. Our findings provide insight into how to focus resources to counteract negative or enhance positive impacts. We apply this framework to a bio-economic model calibrated to the North Sea flatfish fishery. We quantify the adaptations, sensitivities and total impact of fishers' profits to multiple drivers and identify among which of them fishers adapt the most. This work forms a bridge between the multidisciplinary area of adaptability and the bio-economic modelling domain,increasing the understanding and knowledge regarding the measure of adaptation.</description>

      <title>Are Princelings Truly Busted? Evaluating Transaction Discounts in China's Land Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper narrowly replicates Chen and Kung's 2019 paper ($The$ $Quarterly$ $Journal$ $of$ $Economics$ 134(1): 185-226). Inspecting the data reveals that nearly one-third of the transactions (388,903 out of 1,208,621) are perfect duplicates of other rows, excluding the transaction number. Replicating the analysis on the data sans-duplicates yields a slightly smaller but still statistically significant princeling effect, robust across the regression results. Further analysis also reveals that coefficients interpreted as the effect of logarithm of area actually reflect the effect of scaled values of area; this paper also reinterprets and contextualizes these results in light of the true scaled values.</description>

      <title>The Human Capital Accumulation at Research Infrastructures: Reexamining Wage Returns to Training, Models, Interpretation, and Magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a research strategy to measure wage returns of research training targeting early career researchers (ECRs) at research infrastructures (RIs). Grounded in established economic models of education and training, our strategy improves upon existing studies on the same topic in labour market relevance, scope, and economic modelling. We draw on a survey of ECRs at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and find that CERN research training increases ECRs wages by 7 per cent on average, ranging from 2 to 10 per cent. Wage gains materialise early in their careers, typically within the first decade of employment. Wage returns are driven by hard skills, such as software development, data analysis, and problem solving capacity, as well as sought after soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and networking. Our findings suggest that ECRs wage returns primarily reflect productivity improvements rather than the signalling effect of CERN affiliation. Our research applies to other RIs. We conclude by discussing methodological considerations, policy implications, and avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Donald Trumps in the Virtual Polls: Simulating and Predicting Public Opinions in Surveys Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have attracted attention due to their ability to generate human-like text. As surveys and opinion polls remain key tools for gauging public attitudes, there is increasing interest in assessing whether LLMs can accurately replicate human responses. This study examines the potential of LLMs, specifically ChatGPT-4o, to replicate human responses in large-scale surveys and to predict election outcomes based on demographic data. Employing data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the American National Election Studies (ANES), we assess the LLM's performance in two key tasks: simulating human responses and forecasting U.S. election results. In simulations, the LLM was tasked with generating synthetic responses for various socio-cultural and trust-related questions, demonstrating notable alignment with human response patterns across U.S.-China samples, though with some limitations on value-sensitive topics. In prediction tasks, the LLM was used to simulate voting behavior in past U.S. elections and predict the 2024 election outcome. Our findings show that the LLM replicates cultural differences effectively, exhibits in-sample predictive validity, and provides plausible out-of-sample forecasts, suggesting potential as a cost-effective supplement for survey-based research.</description>

      <title>Air Pollution and Under-5 Child Mortality: Evidence from China's Coal Power Plant Phase-out Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the impact of a mandatory shutdown policy of small-capacity coal power plants during China's $11^{th}$ 5-Year Plan period (2006--2010) on under-5 mortality. We collect capacity and location information on 2181 coal power plants that operated during 2000--2010 and compile a unique data set that combines coal power plants, county-level under-5 mortality and socioeconomic variables, high spatial resolution data of PM$_{2.5}$ and SO$_2$ and meteorological conditions. We model the impacts of air pollution on under-5 mortality using the IV-Lasso method, with distance-weighted sums of retired capacity and high-altitude wind status as instrumental variable candidates for air pollution. Our estimates imply that the phase-out policy saved around 46,000 lives during the $11^{th}$ 5-Year Plan period. We also find heterogeneity in the policy effects across regions.

      <title>InvestESG: A multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark for studying climate investment as a social dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. The benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. We are releasing open-source versions of InvestESG in both PyTorch and JAX, which enable scalable and hardware-accelerated simulations for investigating competing incentives in mitigate climate change. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs.</description>
