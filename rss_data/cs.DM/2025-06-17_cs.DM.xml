      <title>Careful synchronisation and the diameter of transformation semigroups with few generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word is called carefully synchronising for a partial deterministic finite semi-automaton if it maps all states to the same state. Equivalently, it is a composition of partial transformations equal to a constant total transformation. There is a sequence of several papers providing stronger and stronger lower bounds on the length of shortest carefully synchronising words for $n$-state partial DFAs over small alphabets. It resulted in the lower bounds of $\Omega(\frac{2^{n/3}}{n\sqrt{n}})$ and $\Omega(\frac{4^{n/5}}{n})$ for alphabets of two and three letters respectively, obtained by de Bondt, Don, and Zantema. Using a significantly simpler construction, we improve these lower bounds to $2^{(n - 4)/3}$ and $4^{(n - 4)/5}$ respectively.
  We then consider a tightly related question of the diameter of a partial DFA, which is the smallest $\ell \ge 0$ such that words of length at most $\ell$ express all the transformations induced by words in this DFA. We show that an alphabet of large enough constant size already asymptotically matches the upper bound on the diameter for arbitrary alphabet size, extending the construction of Panteleev that requires an alphabet of size exponential in the number of states. We then discuss an application to the diameter of finite semigroups of nonnegative matrices, and some open problems.</description>

      <title>The Ultimate Signs of Second-Order Holonomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A real-valued sequence $f = \{ f(n) \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is said to be second-order holonomic if it satisfies a linear recurrence $f (n + 2) = P (n) f (n + 1) + Q (n) f (n)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, where $P, Q \in \mathbb{R}(x)$ are rational functions. We study the ultimate sign of such a sequence, i.e., the repeated pattern that the signs of $f (n)$ follow for sufficiently large $n$. For each $P$, $Q$ we determine all the ultimate signs that $f$ can have, and show how they partition the space of initial values of $f$. This completes the prior work by Neumann, Ouaknine and Worrell, who have settled some restricted cases. As a corollary, it follows that when $P$, $Q$ have rational coefficients, $f$ either has an ultimate sign of length $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $8$ or $12$, or never falls into a repeated sign pattern. We also give a partial algorithm that finds the ultimate sign of $f$ (or tells that there is none) in almost all cases.</description>

      <title>Solving the Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Graph Neural Networks: A Customizable Reinforcement Learning Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The job shop scheduling problem is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem relevant to manufacturing and timetabling. Traditional approaches use priority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has attempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training such models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node features, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for experimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces JobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and creating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained several dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's utility. One model outperformed various graph-based dispatchers using only individual operation features, highlighting the importance of feature customization. Our GNN model achieved near state-of-the-art results on large-scale problems. These results suggest significant room for improvement in developing such models. JobShopLib provides the necessary tools for future experimentation.</description>

      <title>What is and is not inside a Cayley graph?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we show that there is a cubic graph of girth $5$ that is not a subgraph of any minimal Cayley graph. On the other hand, we show that any Generalized Petersen Graph $G(n,k)$ with $\gcd(n,k)=1$ is an induced subgraph of a minimal Cayley graph. These results give insights into two comments of L\'aszl\'o Babai in [L. Babai, \emph{Automorphism groups, isomorphism, reconstruction}. Graham, R. L. (ed.) et al., Handbook of combinatorics. Vol. 1-2, 1994].</description>

      <title>A group-theoretic approach to Shannon capacity of graphs and a limit theorem from lattice packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a group-theoretic approach to the Shannon capacity problem. Using this approach we extend and recover, in a structured and unified manner, various families of previously known lower bounds on the Shannon capacity. Bohman (2003) proved that, in the limit $p\to\infty$, the Shannon capacity of cycle graphs $\Theta(C_p)$ converges to the fractional clique covering number, that is, $\lim_{p \to \infty} p/2 - \Theta(C_p) = 0$. We strengthen this result by proving that the same is true for all fraction graphs: $\lim_{p/q \to \infty} p/q - \Theta(E_{p/q}) = 0$. Here the fraction graph $E_{p/q}$ is the graph with vertex set $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ in which two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if their distance mod $p$ is strictly less than $q$. We obtain the limit via the group-theoretic approach. In particular, the independent sets we construct in powers of fraction graphs are subgroups (and, in fact, lattices). Our approach circumvents known barriers for structured ("linear") constructions of independent sets of Calderbank-Frankl-Graham-Li-Shepp (1993) and Guruswami-Riazanov (2021).</description>

      <title>On the Uncrossed Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visualizing a graph $G$ in the plane nicely, for example, without crossings, is unfortunately not always possible. To address this problem, Masa\v{r}\'ik and Hlin\v{e}n\'y [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of $G$ to be drawn without crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of $G$. More formally, a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of drawings of $G$ is uncrossed if, for each edge $e$ of $G$, there is a drawing in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $e$ is uncrossed. The uncrossed number $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ of $G$ is then the minimum number of drawings in some uncrossed collection of $G$.
  No exact values of the uncrossed numbers have been determined yet, not even for simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for uncrossed numbers of complete and complete bipartite graphs, partly confirming and partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik. We also present a strong general lower bound on $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ in terms of the number of vertices and edges of $G$. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness of the related problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph $G$, which is the smallest number of edges of $G$ taken over all drawings of $G$ that participate in a crossing. This problem was posed as open by Schaefer in his book [Crossing Numbers of Graphs 2018].</description>
