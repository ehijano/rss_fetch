      <title>Interpretation of measured 3x3 partial depolarizing Mueller matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mueller polarimetry is a powerful technique with broad applications in astronomy, remote sensing, advanced material analysis, and biomedical imaging. However, instrumental constraints frequently restrict the measurement to an incomplete Mueller matrix limited to its upper-left 3x3 submatrix. Simply padding the missing entries with zeros to form a 4x4 matrix can produce physically inconsistent results, even for nondepolarizing systems. To address this issue, we present a systematic procedure to complete 3x3 measured Mueller matrices into physically consistent 4x4 matrices. The method relies on the covariance matrix formalism and selects, among the infinitely many admissible completions, the one with maximal polarimetric purity. This criterion ensures that the synthesized matrix corresponds to the least random (most deterministic) model compatible with the measurement. The procedure is fully general and can be applied to any 3x3 partial Mueller polarimetric data, providing a reliable and physically grounded reconstruction tool for polarimetric imaging and materials characterization.</description>

      <title>In-space manufacturing of optical lenses: Fluidic Shaping aboard the International Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-space manufacturing technologies are vital for enabling advanced space missions and addressing logistical limitations of space exploration. While additive manufacturing has progressed rapidly, it still falls short of delivering the ultra-smooth surfaces required for optical elements. Fluidic Shaping is a novel method that harnesses surface tension under microgravity to form optical components with exceptionally smooth surfaces. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of Fluidic Shaping as a method for manufacturing optical components in space through two experiments performed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Ax-1 mission. The first experiment involved fabricating centimeter-scale polymer lenses, solidifying them via ultraviolet (UV) curing, and analyzing the resultant optics upon their return to Earth. While sub-nanometric surface smoothness was achieved, some polymer lenses displayed unexpected thermo-chemical deformations, indicating complex polymerization dynamics unique to the microgravity environment. In the second experiment, a large-scale, 172 mm diameter water lens was deployed, confirming Fluidic Shaping's scalability and demonstrating basic optical functionality through image analysis. These experiments collectively underline the technique's relevance for both small-scale optics and large-aperture applications. Our results highlight critical considerations for future research, including optimizing polymerization processes and refining liquid-handling methods to advance practical, in-space optical manufacturing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Non-invasive optical quantification of methanol in bottled spirits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Food and beverage contamination poses a persistent global threat. A prime example is the presence of methanol in counterfeit or illicit spirits, causing severe and often fatal poisoning worldwide. Rapid, non-destructive, and on-site screening methods capable of molecular analysis directly through commercial packaging are therefore urgently needed for quality control and consumer safety. Here, we introduce a non-invasive optical approach based on Raman spectroscopy that judiciously combines wavefront shaping with wavelength modulation to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and enable quantification of methanol in unopened bottled spirits. A limit of detection of 0.2% (v/v) methanol in 40% ethanol was achieved, well below the 2% (v/v) threshold for safe human consumption. This truly non-invasive method remains robust through coloured glass bottles, with calibration validated in a real spirit sample. By enabling through-container methanol detection, the technique offers a practical tool to protect consumers and streamline routine screening across the beverage supply chain. Moreover, this Raman geometry establishes a versatile platform for assessing authenticity, composition, and contaminants directly through packaging.</description>

      <title>A laser with instability reaching $4 \times 10^{-17}$ based on a 10-cm-long silicon cavity at sub-5-K temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of ultra-stable lasers with $10^{-17}$-level frequency stability has enabled a wide range of researches on precision metrology and fundamental science, where cryogenic single-crystalline cavities constitute the heart of such ultra-stable lasers. For further improvements in stability, increasing the cavity length at few-kelvin temperatures provides a promising alternative to utilizing relatively short cavities with novel coating, but has yet to be demonstrated with state-of-the-art stability. Here we report on the realization of a relatively long ultra-stable silicon cavity with a length of 10 cm and sub-5-K operating temperatures. We devise a dynamical protocol of cool-quiet quench measurement that reveals the inherent $10^{-17}$-level frequency instability of the silicon cavity despite the substantially larger frequency noise induced by the cryostat vibration. We further develop a method for suppressing the cryostat-vibration-induced frequency noise under continuous cooling, and observe an average frequency instability of $4.3(2) \times 10^{-17}$ for averaging times of 4 to 12 seconds. Using the measured noise power spectral density, we compute a median linewidth of 9.6(3) mHz for the silicon cavity laser at 1397 nm, which is supported by an empirically determined linewidth of 5.7(3) mHz based on direct optical beat measurements. These results establish a new record for optical cavities within a closed-cycle cryocooler at sub-5-K temperatures and provide a prototypical system for using long cryogenic cavities to enhance frequency stabilities to the low-$10^{-17}$ or better level.</description>

      <title>Developing a Cost-Effective Spectrometer: A Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating &amp; Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>

      <title>Can a vector beam be critically coupled leading to perfect absorption?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical coupling has emerged as a prominent area of research in recent years. However, most theoretical models are based on scalar theories (and occasionally coupled mode theories), which inadequately account for the polarization states of the incident light. To bridge this gap, we revisit the concept of critical coupling in planar multilayer structures using a full vectorial theory, where conventional plane wave illumination is replaced by well-defined vector beams with and without orbital angular momentum (OAM). Our investigation explores the possibility of complete absorption of monochromatic beams without and with intrinsic OAM (such as Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG)), incident on the multilayer structure at normal or oblique incidence. A two-component metal-dielectric composite film is chosen as the absorbing layer in the system. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in the intensities of the reflected and transmitted beams at normal incidence, with reduced efficiency for oblique incidence due to the lack of spatial overlap of multiply reflected components. Interestingly, we also observe super-scattering from the same structures when conditions for constructive interference of the various reflected components are satisfied. This work highlights the need to incorporate the vector nature of beams by retaining the complete polarization information of off-axis spatial harmonics in future studies.</description>

      <title>Versatile 3D reconstruction framework for hard X-ray grazing incidence imaging of nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent imaging techniques such as ptychography offer powerful capabilities for 3D resolution of nanoscale structures. By application in grazing incidence, such techniques may achieve exceptional surface sensitivity as demonstrated by grazing incidence small angle scattering. This requires however an extension of the conventional analysis based on the Distorted Wave Born Approximation which is typically limited to stratified-layer models and statistical descriptions of in-plane structures. The prevailing implementations of reconstruction algorithms for ptychography based on the projection approximation fails to capture the significant multiple scattering that occurs in grazing incidence. We present a ptychographic reconstruction framework that replaces the single-scattering model with a multislice wave-propagation formalism tailored to grazing incidence. The framework supports simultaneous phase retrieval and reconstruction, and can incorporate multiple incidence angles, multiple rotation angles, and flexible experimental geometries into a single inversion. Reconstructions can be initialized from a random guess without strong structural priors, enabling the recovery of complex surface and near-surface nanostructures. This reconstruction framework is applied to both experimental and simulated datasets, demonstrating its versatility.</description>

      <title>All-optical polarization control in time-varying low-index films via plasma symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the polarization state of light with sub-picosecond speed and subwavelength precision remains a key challenge for next-generation nanophotonic devices. Conventional methods such as birefringent crystals, liquid crystals, or electro-optic Pockels cells are limited in speed, compactness, and energy efficiency. While structured materials and two-dimensional heterostructures offer potential for on-chip ultrafast performance, achieving all-optical control remains an open problem. Here we introduce an all-optical scheme that employs femtosecond pumping of low-index, subwavelength isotropic films to achieve ultrafast control over birefringence, dichroism, and optical activity within a single material platform. When the material is probed near its crossover wavelength, linearly polarized pumping induces a transient phase retardation up to 0.1{\pi} per micrometer, accompanied by a dichroic absorption ratio of approximately twenty. Under circularly polarized excitation, the probe experiences nonreciprocal optical activity, leading to polarization rotation of about 1.1 degrees per micrometer. A universal hydrodynamic model quantitatively reproduces these effects and attributes them to pump-induced symmetry breaking in the photoexcited carrier plasma. This symmetry breaking enables coupling between orthogonal probe polarization components, mediated by a modified time-dependent damping term, which connects to the inverse Faraday effect induced by a circularly polarized pump. Our combined experimental and theoretical study establishes a reconfigurable, deep-subwavelength polarization-control mechanism operating on sub-picosecond timescales, suitable for compact ultrafast modulators, dynamic metasurfaces, and tunable nonreciprocal photonic devices, with implications for quantum optics, ultrafast logic, and time-resolved sensing.</description>

      <title>Dispersion and the transport of exciton-polaritons in an optical conveyor belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in exciton-polaritons has driven the need to manipulate their motion and engineer their band structures to the forefront of contemporary research. This study explores the band structures that emerge from a spatially modulated potential, ingeniously realized through the use of an optical conveyor belt. By leveraging Bloch theory and conducting a meticulous analysis of the time evolution of polariton intensity in Fourier space, we have derived the energy dispersion relations both analytically and numerically within the context of a static lattice model. For time-dependent potentials, we employ the Lagrange variational method to elucidate the dynamics of polariton motion. Our results reveal that polaritons exhibit linear dispersion and follow linear trajectories with minor oscillations superimposed. This investigation not only deepens our fundamental understanding of exciton-polaritons but also provides a robust tool for advancing photonic devices and exerting precise control over current transport in quantum computing. Our findings pave the way for future innovations in high-speed and high-performance technologies.</description>

      <title>Engineering Rogue Waves via Multimode Interactions in Integrated Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore rogue wave formation in multimode silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) waveguides with multimode nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation-based simulations. Pure fundamental-mode excitation produces smooth propagation without extreme events, whereas higher-order modes or multimode superpositions yield heavy-tailed statistics with bursts exceeding the $8\sigma$ threshold. These results reveal that rogue wave generation in integrated waveguides is controlled not only by material properties such as nonlinearity and dispersion but also by modal excitation and intermodal nonlinear interactions. Our results identify modal control as a new degree of freedom for engineering extreme spatiotemporal events on photonic chips, with implications for on-chip supercontinuum generation, frequency combs, and nonlinear wave management.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a CMOS-compatible silicon-rich nitride metalens array for visible microscopy at 660 nm. Three co-planar elements provide numerical apertures of 0.54, 0.92, and 0.97, enabling within-sample NA benchmarking without objective swaps. Imaging of annular cell monolayers labeled in the AF647 ZO-1 channel shows progressive sharpening of junctional edges and reduced blur with increasing NA, consistent with diffraction-limited scaling. The compact, planar platform supports direct integration with image sensors, offering a practical route to high-NA fluorescence bioimaging in space-constrained, low-cost systems.</description>

      <title>Multimode emission of fluorinated ethylene propylene clad large diameter liquid-core lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A liquid-core (LiCo) dye laser was demonstrated using Rhodamine B (RhB) dissolved in glycerol as the gain medium and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing as the waveguide. Photoluminescence and amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) studies identified optimal RhB concentrations of 0.1 wt.% and 0.3 wt.% for low-threshold laser operation. Laser emission was achieved in LiCo rods with 1/16 inch and 1/32 inch inner diameter FEP tubing, with narrower tubing providing enhanced mode confinement and spectral narrowing. The addition of cavity mirrors improved emission coherence, revealing a distinct laser mode at low pump energies with mode spacing inconsistent with a simple Fabry-P\'erot cavity, indicating complex mode coupling and internal reflections. Limitations include spectral broadening and scattering-induced parasitic feedback, which suggest avenues for further optimization in waveguide materials and output coupling.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide expressions for the detected optical irradiance for magneto-optic characterization of superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPNs) in solution imparting Faraday rotation (FR) to an optical beam passing through the sample solution. For our analysis, we assume a Langevin model for SPN samples and show the presence of odd and even harmonics for SPN samples characterized with a Michelson interferometer. This optical geometry is potentially useful in understanding nonlinear SPN FR behavior as a result of particle aggregation-based scattering effects.</description>

      <title>Advanced mirror shapes for mode enhancement in plano-concave cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical cavities are frequently used in quantum technologies to enhance light matter interactions, with applications including single photon generation and entanglement of distant emitters. The Fabry-P\'{e}rot resonator is a popular choice for its high optical access and large emitter-mirror separation. A typical configuration, particularly for emitters that should not be placed close to the mirror surface like trapped ions and Rydberg atoms, features two spherical mirrors placed around a central emitter, but this arrangement can put demanding requirements on the mirror alignment. In contrast, plano-concave cavities are tolerant to mirror misalignment and only require the manufacture of one curved mirror, but have limited ability to focus light in the centre of the cavity. Here we show how mirror shaping can overcome this limitation of plano-concave cavities while preserving the key advantages. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that simple mirror shaping can increase coupling between a plano-concave cavity and a central emitter by an order of magnitude, even rivalling misalignment-sensitive concave-concave counterparts for achievable interaction strength. We use these observations to establish the conditions under which plano-concave cavities with shaped mirrors could improve the performance and practicality of emitter-cavity systems.</description>

Abstract: The spectral properties, momentum dispersion, and broadening of bulk plasmonic excitations of 25 elemental metals are studied from first principles calculations in the random-phase approximation. Spectral band structures are constructed from the resulting momentum- and frequency-dependent inverse dielectric function. We develop an effective analytical representation of the main collective excitations in the dielectric response, by extending our earlier model based on multipole-Pad\'e approximants (MPA) to incorporate both momentum and frequency dependence. With this tool, we identify plasmonic quasiparticle dispersions exhibiting complex features, including non-parabolic energy and intensity dispersions, discontinuities due to anisotropy, and overlapping effects that lead to band crossings and anti-crossings. We also find good agreement between computed results and available experiments in the optical limit. The results for elemental metals establish a reference point that can guide both fundamental studies and practical applications in plasmonics and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>A Flux-Tunable Discrete Angular Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Lawrie et al. [PRR 7, 023209 (2025)] introduced a non-diffracting resonant angular filter on a network of thin channels (modelled via quantum graph theory) that exhibits unit transmission of acoustic waves at a discrete, symmetry-paired set of incidence angles determined solely by the graph topology, while transmission at all other angles is strictly forbidden. In the present work, we study the same filtering geometry for waves governed by the magnetic Schr\"odinger equation rather than the classical wave equation. Using a phase shift induced by non-reciprocal wave propagation due to the presence of the magnetic potential and tuning $\delta$-type vertex boundary conditions, we make the previously topology-fixed discrete pass directions continuously tunable: both the transmission angle and the transmission coefficient become control parameters. The resulting flux-tunable angular filtering device replaces topology-constrained passbands with a programmable steering device, broadening the scope for wave-filter and beam-shaping applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Molecular Single-Photon Emitters: A Materials-Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interfacing light with quantum systems is an integral part of quantum technology, with the most essential building block being single-photon emitters. Although various platforms exist, each with its individual strengths, molecular emitters boast a unique advantage -- namely the flexibility to tailor their design to fit the requirements of a specific task. However, the characteristics of the vast space of possible molecular configurations are challenging to understand and explore. Here, we present a theoretical and computational framework to initiate exploration of this vast potential by integrating database analysis with microscopic predictions. Using a model system of dibenzoterrylene in an anthracene host as benchmark, our approach identifies promising new candidates, among them a chiral molecular emitter. Future extensions of our approach integrated with machine learning routines hold the promise of ultimately unlocking the full potential of molecular quantum light-matter interfaces.</description>

      <title>Long wave infrared detection using probabilistic spintronic bolometer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of probabilistic spintronic devices for infrared radiation detection has introduced a shift in approach to thermal imaging. The integration of probabilistic magnetic tunnel junctions with infrared plasmonic nano-antennas achieves high-sensitivity digital-mode infrared sensors at room temperature. Here, we present a scalable approach towards multipixel plasmonic-spintronic bolometer array fabrication and readout. We fabricate proof-of-concept 2x2 row-column multiplexed probabilistic plasmonic sprintronic arrays and show their response to long-wave infrared radiation (8-14um) with high readout speeds (10K-1M counts per second). These spintronic, ultrafast, nanoscale (SUN) bolometers can result in novel high-pixel density CMOS compatible infrared detection platforms. Our work provides a broadband (9kHz to 3GHz) readout platform for future digital probabilistic detector applications. Furthermore, our approach addresses a key challenge associated with scaling infrared pixel sizes that can drive progress towards high pixel density detector arrays for infrared sensing and microscopy applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Response in Pseudo-Hermitian Systems at Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a steady-state theory for nonlinear optical conductivity in pseudo-Hermitian systems. We derive compact formulas for the first and second order conductivity tensors in both the velocity and length gauges and prove their exact equivalence through generalized sum rules and Berry connection identities by formulating the nonlinear response in terms of a biorthogonal density matrix. Utilizing the formalism on parity-time symmetric two-level systems reveals nonlinear phenomena that are not present in Hermitian systems, such as extra terms in the conductivity, corrections to the velocity operator, photocurrent, and resonance structures with higher-order poles at one-photon transitions. These features yield qualitatively distinct harmonic generation responses like real second-order conductivities and nonzero DC limits. These results provide new insights into nonlinear light-matter interactions in active media characterized by balanced gain and loss, with implications for non-Hermitian photonics, dissipative topological systems, and quantum devices designed with engineered dissipation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Realistic Threat Models for Fiber and Free-Space Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future global quantum communication networks, or quantum Internet, will realize high-rate secure communication and entanglement distribution for large-scale users over long distances. Continuous variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a powerful setting for secure quantum communications, thanks to the use of room-temperature off-the-shelf optical devices and the potential to reach high rates. However, the achievable performance of CV-QKD protocols is fundamentally limited by the fact that they appear to be fragile to both loss and noise. In this study, we provide a general framework for analyzing the composable finite-size security of CV-QKD with Gaussian-modulated coherent-state protocol (GMCS) under various levels of trust for the loss and noise experienced by the users of the protocol. Our work is comprehensive of several practical scenarios, encompassing both active and passive eavesdropping configurations, with both wired (i.e., fiber-based) and wireless (i.e., free-space and satellite-based) quantum communication channels. Our numerical results evaluate the robustness of the GMCS protocol under varying levels of trust and demonstrate that it is difficult for a practical protocol to remain robust against untrusted loss at the transmitter. In the wireless case, we analyze a scenario with a sun-synchronous satellite, showing that its key distribution rate, even with the worst level of trust, can outperform a ground chain of ideal quantum repeaters. Our results indicate that, when it comes to engineering and optimizing quantum-safe networks, it is essential to mitigate the shortcomings caused by critical trade-offs between rate performance, trust level, system noise, and communication distance.</description>

      <title>Transverse instability of hybrid solitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse instability of two-component solitons forming in a planar waveguide operating in the regime of strong light-matter coupling. The instability emerges as a result of the coupling between transverse diffraction of the photonic component and nonlinearity of the material excitations. Solutions of three different forms are addressed which include bright, gray-dark, and gray-gray solitons. In the limit of long-wavelength transverse perturbations, the instability is described with an asymptotic expansion whose predictions agree with the results of numerical simulations. The dynamic development of instability of initially perturbed bright solitons leads to the formation of high-intensity spots in the photonic component. For gray-dark and dark-dark solitons, the transverse instability leads to the spontaneous nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs which emerge in both fields as transient patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unique optical properties of quantum dots (QDs), size-tunable emission and high quantum yield, make them ideal candidates for applications in secure quantum communication, quantum computing, targeted single-cell and molecular tagging, and sensing. Scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies for single QDs have, however, remained largely out of reach due to inherent material incompatibilities with conventional semiconductor manufacturing processes. To advance scalable photonic quantum device architectures, it is therefore crucial to adopt placement and heterointegration strategies that can address these challenges. Here, we present an electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model, single particle extraction electrodynamics (SPEED) printing, that exploits a novel regime of nanoscale dielectrophoretics to print and deterministically position single colloidal QDs. Using QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic imprecision that limited previous colloidal deposition strategies, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and single-photon emission from single printed QDs. By enabling deterministic placement of single quantum dots, this method provides a powerful, scalable, and sustainable platform for integrating complex photonic circuits and quantum light sources with nanoscale precision.</description>

      <title>Role of plasma waves in rescattering processes in intense laser fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rescattering of the photoelectron at its parent ion underlie a number of phenomena in intense laser field interaction with matter, such as high harmonic generation, attosecond pulse production, non-sequential double ionization, and others. These processes are unavoidably accompanied by the medium photoionization. The interaction of the laser pulse with the photoionization-induced plasma excites wakefield waves, which are self-consistently coupled plasma density and Langmuir waves. We study theoretically the effect of the electric field of the plasma wave on the rescattering processes. We show that this field can compensate for the magnetic drift of the rescattering electron, which otherwise dramatically suppresses the rescattering efficiency in intense low-frequency laser fields. Moreover, the presence of the plasma wave field leads to new lines in the spectrum emitted due to the XUV free-induction decay (XFID). Observation of these lines can allow, in particular, the detection of forbidden transition frequencies, thus providing new perspectives for XFID spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, using the time-dependent density functional theory, we address the electron tunneling triggered by short (single-cycle and several-cycle) optical pulses in narrow metallic gaps under conditions relevant for actual experiments. We identify photon-assisted tunneling with one-photon, two-photon, and higher-order photon absorption, and we discuss the effect of the tunneling barrier, applied bias, and strength of the optical field on transition from photon-assisted tunneling (weak optical fields) to the optical field emission at strong optical fields. The numerical single-electron calculations and an analytical strong-field theory model are used to gain deeper insights into the results of the time-dependent density functional theory calculations. Additionally, our parameter-free calculations allow us to retrieve and explain recent experimental results on optically induced transport in narrow metallic gaps under an applied dc bias.</description>

Abstract: Integrated photonics has revolutionized fields such as telecommunications, quantum optics, and metrology by enabling compact, scalable circuits through highly confined optical modes. Within the field of quantum acoustics, phonons have emerged as a compelling alternative, offering advantages such as lower energy, smaller mode volume, and low propagation speeds, which make them ideal for interfacing diverse quantum systems. Developing integrated phononic circuits is thus essential for unlocking the full potential of quantum acoustics and advancing technologies such as quantum computing and hybrid systems. In this work, we demonstrate the first 4-port directional coupler for quantum mechanical excitations - a key building block for phononic circuits. By tuning the coupling region length, we achieve phononic beam splitters with controllable splitting ratios. We validate quantum-level performance by sending a single-phonon Fock state through the device. This work represents a foundational advance toward scalable, integrated phononic platforms for both classical and quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light with optomechanical and spin-light quantum interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</description>
