      <title>Canonical Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21650v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, thermodynamics of canonical systems is derived from the multinomial distribution of the occupancy numbers of quantum eigenstates. The cathegorical distribution (i.e. the one-particle distribution) on which the multinomial distribution is based, should be derived from the maximum entropy principle, but, being the multinomial distribution intractable, the paper proposes to take instead the Boltzmann distribution as cathegorical distribution, discussing the reason why the entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution should closely approximate the entropy achieved by the multinomial distribution equipped with the entropy-maximizing cathegorical distribution. After this, the imposition of Clausius' equation on the Shannon entropy of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution leads to an unexpected result: in general, the Lagrange multiplier $\beta$ that imposes the energy constraint in constrained entropy maximization turns out to be substantially different from the inverse temperature. To support this unexpected result, the paper presents an example where, with $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature, the thermodynamic entropy (i.e. the entropy at a given temperature) of the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution is greater than the Bose-Einstein thermodynamic entropy. However, the latter is derived from entropy maximization with constrained expected energy and expected number of particles, therefore if we plug $\beta$ equal to the inverse temperature in the multinomial-Boltzmann distribution, then the thermodynamics of the canonical system obtained in this way turns out to be non-compatible with the principle of maximum entropy.</description>

      <title>Flocking with random non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flocking is ubiquitous in nature and emerges due to short or long range alignment interactions among self-propelled agents. Two unfriendly species that anti-align or even interact non-reciprocally show more complex collective phenomena, ranging from parallel and anti-parallel flocking over runand chase behavior to chiral phases. Whether flocking or any of these collective phenomena can survive in the presence of a large number of species with random non-reciprocal interactions remained elusive so far. As a first step here the extreme case of a Vicsek-like model with fully random nonreciprocal interactions between the individual particles is considered. As soon as the alignment bias is of the same order as the random interactions the ordered flocking phase occurs, but deep within this phase, the random non-reciprocal interactions can still support global chiral and oscillating states in which the collective movement direction rotates or oscillates slowly. For short-range interactions, moreover, even without alignment bias self-organized cliques emerge, in which medium size clusters of particles that have predominantly aligning interactions meet accidentally and stay together for macroscopic times. These results may serve as a starting point for the study of multi-species flocking models with non-random but complex non-reciprocal inter-species interactions.</description>

      <title>Long-range systems, (non)extensivity, and the rescaling of energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with long-range interactions have seen a surge of interest in the past decades. In the wake of this surge, the use of a system size dependent rescaling, sometimes termed "Kac prescription," of the long-range pair potential has seen widespread use. This ad hoc modification of the Hamiltonian makes the energy extensive, but its physical justification and implications are a frequent source of confusion and misinterpretation. After all, in real physical $N$-body systems, the pair interaction strength does not scale with the number $N$ of constituents. This article presents, at an introductory level, scaling arguments that provide a clear physical interpretation of the "Kac prescription" for finite systems as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Entropy of self-avoiding branching polymers: mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Quantum Turbulence in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate via the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Heavy-Light Asymptotics from Thermal Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of spectral densities and heavy-heavy-light (HHL) operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients in three-dimensional conformal field theories using thermal one-point functions on $S^1 \times S^2$. A central element of our analysis is a new inversion formula for one-point functions which is derived via Casimir differential equations. We develop systematic expansions of the spectral density and HHL OPE coefficients in the regime of large $\Delta_H$. We validate our analytic tools by comparing the results with the partial wave expansions of thermal one-point functions in free field theories. The algorithms developed for these expansions make full use of Casimir recursion relations, thereby extending their applicability into the heavy exchange regime. In the end, we observe excellent agreement with our analytic predictions and an improvement of up to three orders of magnitude compared to all previous leading order estimates of the CFT data even for moderate values of $\Delta_H$.</description>

      <title>Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum representation.</description>

      <title>Practical roadmap to measurement-altered criticality in Rydberg arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak measurements have been predicted to dramatically alter universal properties of quantum critical wavefunctions, though experimental validation remains an open problem. Here we devise a practical scheme for realizing measurement-altered criticality in a chain of Rydberg atoms tuned to Ising and tricritical Ising phase transitions. In particular, we show that projectively measuring a periodic subset of atoms alters quantum critical correlations in distinct ways that one can control via the choice of measured sites and the measurement outcomes. While our protocol relies on post-selection, the measurement outcomes yielding the most dramatic consequences occur with surprisingly large probabilities: O(10%) with chains featuring O(100) sites. Characterizing the proposed post-measurement states requires only an adjustment in the post-process averaging of outcomes used to characterize unmeasured critical states, resulting in minimal additional experimental overhead for demonstrating measurement-altered criticality.</description>

      <title>Ecosystems as adaptive living circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike many physical nonequilibrium systems, in biological systems, the coupling to external energy sources is not a fixed parameter but adaptively controlled by the system itself. We do not have theoretical frameworks that allow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent behavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive coevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a framework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the energy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional nonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from equilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical driving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that saves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the adaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking any global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal dissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work establishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose structure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules.</description>

Abstract: We formulate the Schr\"odinger problem for interacting particle systems in the hydrodynamical regime thus extending the standard setting of independent particles. This involves the large deviations rate function for the empirical measure which is in fact a richer observable than the hydrodynamic observables density and current. In the case in which the constraints are the initial and final density, we characterize the optimal measure for the Schr\"odinger problem. We also introduce versions of the Schr\"odinger problem in which the constraints are related to the current and analyze the corresponding optimal measures.</description>

      <title>Perfect quantum state transfer through a chaotic spin chain via many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.</description>

      <title>General many-body entanglement swapping protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt coefficients vanishes. The cost of many-body swapping - arising from postselection in a third-party measurement - is determined by the 3rd R\'enyi entanglement entropy of the partitioning. We provide a proof of concept of the protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new functionalities, such as flexible sharing of complex multi-qubit states and fault-tolerant entanglement swapping.</description>

Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems, non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in the problem at hand.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Circuits: Association of thermoelectric converters in stationary non-equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following up on the recently published circuit theory for thermodynamic devices, we consider networks of Thermo-Electric Converters (TECs) in stationary non-equilibrium. Assuming constant thermoelectric properties, the integration over a finite thickness of the linear local response of the thermoelectric material yields the non-linear current-force characteristics. We show how to derive a choice of nonequilibrium conductance matrix summarizing the current-force characteristics for every available sets of currents and forces. This problem has infinitely many solutions if one considers only thermodynamic constraints. Each solution differs, among others, by the coupling between the currents. Then, we determine the current-force characteristics of the serial (respectively parallel) association of two TECs using the laws of resistance (respectively conductance) matrix addition. For TECs in series, we find current-dependent boundary conditions for each sub-device. Since currents derive from composite potentials, we also associate the derivability and continuity of these potentials at the interfaces with conditions on thermoelectric coefficients. For TECs in parallel, we discuss the possibility of loop currents that are forbidden for the serial association.</description>

      <title>Thermal response functions and second sound in single-layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10649v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ballistic heat transport and second sound propagation in solids is of direct relevance in electronic and energy applications at short length scales and low temperatures. Measurement or calculation of thermal conductivity, which is typically a primary objective, may be of limited usefulness for predicting heat transport which does not follow the heat-diffusion equation. In this paper, molecular-dynamics simulations of hexagonal BN (h-BN) are used to compute thermal response functions from equilibrium correlation functions defined in Fourier space. The response functions are useful for describing the time-dependent transport beyond the usual assumptions of Fourier's law. The results demonstrate that for length scales ~110nm at T=100K second sound should be experimentally observable. At higher temperatures and longer length scales, while second sound may not be directly observable, thermal transport can nevertheless strongly deviate from predictions based on the heat-diffusion equation. Along with classical simulations, we outline a first-principles, many-body theoretical approach for calculation of the response function based on solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The relevant expressions for heat current clarify the importance of phase coherence within a phonon branch to the observation of second sound. Previous work on one-dimensional chains is also discussed to show that materials characterized by linear dispersion and simple phonon band structure should more readily display second sound.</description>

      <title>The role of fluctuations in the nucleation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence upon cooling of an ordered solid phase from a liquid is a remarkable example of self-assembly, which has also major practical relevance. Here, we use a recently developed committor-based enhanced sampling method [Kang et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460 (2024); Trizio et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 1-10 (2025)] to explore the crystallization transition in a Lennard-Jones fluid, using Kolmogorov's variational principle. In particular, we take advantage of the properties of our sampling method to harness a large number of configurations from the transition state ensemble. From this wealth of data, we achieve precise localization of the transition state region, revealing a nucleation pathway that deviates from idealized spherical growth assumptions. Furthermore, we take advantage of the probabilistic nature of the committor to detect and analyze the fluctuations that lead to nucleation. Our study nuances classical nucleation theory by showing that the growing nucleus has a complex structure, consisting of a solid core surrounded by an interface that is more disordered than bulk liquid. We also compute from the Kolmogorov's principle a nucleation rate that is consistent with the experimental results at variance with previous computational estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a graph theoretical approach to the configurational statistics of random tree-like objects, such as randomly branching polymers. In particular, for ideal trees we show that Pr\"ufer labelling provides: (i) direct access to the exact configurational entropy as a function of the tree composition, (ii) computable exact expressions for partition functions and important experimental observables for tree ensembles with controlled branching activity and (iii) an efficient sampling scheme for corresponding tree configurations and arbitrary static properties.</description>

      <title>Ordering and association of patchy particles in quasi-one-dimensional channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the formalism of Wertheim's first order thermodynamic perturbation theory can be generalised for the fluid of rotating sticky particles with anisotropic hard core confined to a quasi-one-dimensional channel. Using the transfer matrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction is additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick together only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of association in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural and thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and fraction of sites unbonded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08826v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-fluid theory for superfluid hydrodynamics is derived from the fountain pressure result that condensed bosons move at constant entropy and are driven by the chemical potential gradient. Explicit results for $^4$He show that the superfluid has vorticity, which is consistent with measured data but inconsistent with Landau's principle that superfluid flow is irrotational.</description>

      <title>A Heuristic Study of Temperature: Quantum Circuitry in Thermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical thermodynamic singularities at phase transitions and in negative-temperature regimes arise because the equal-a-priori probability postulate overlooks the quantum dynamical complexity required to prepare microstates. We promote bounded dynamical complexity to a postulate and develop Complexity Windowed Thermodynamics (CWT). Introducing a finite complexity budget yields the windowed entropy, an entropy of ignorance that is smooth in energy and monotonically non-increasing in the budget. Smoothness guarantees a finite, continuous effective temperature and a non-negative complexity generation potential, thereby regularizing all classical singularities while recovering standard statistical mechanics as the complexity budget approaches infinity. CWT's generalized first law unveils an information processing work term. From unitary channel geometry we derive universal bounds on action and time: the action consumed must be proportional to the optimal circuit complexity, while the minimum required time is inversely proportional to the effective temperature. The framework unifies phenomena from critical point smoothing to black hole information flow, and predicts that the universe's total generatable complexity and its holographic entropy are of the same order bridging thermodynamics, quantum computation, and gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature-learning deep nets progressively collapse data to a regular low-dimensional geometry. How this emerges from the collective action of nonlinearity, noise, learning rate, and other factors, has eluded first-principles theories built from microscopic neuronal dynamics. We exhibit a noise-nonlinearity phase diagram that identifies regimes where shallow or deep layers learn more effectively and propose a macroscopic mechanical theory that reproduces the diagram and links feature learning across layers to generalization.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Feature of Quantum Many-Body Scar States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical correlations of nonintegrable systems with quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states generated by a ladder operator. The spectral function of the ladder operator has an exact $\delta$-function peak induced by the QMBS states. As a concrete example, we show that in the one-dimensional (1D) spin-$1$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, the spectral function of two-magnon excitations exhibits a characteristic bow-tie shape composed of a $\delta$-function resonance peak at momentum $k=\pi$ and a continuum spectrum elsewhere. The two-magnon excitations can be observed with the resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy on quasi-1D nickelates and other spin-$1$ antiferromagnetic materials, thus it paves the way to detecting the (approximate) QMBS states in realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Concomitant Entanglement and Control Criticality Driven by Collective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive quantum circuits-where a quantum many-body state is controlled using measurements and conditional unitary operations-are a powerful paradigm for state preparation and quantum error correction tasks. They can support two types of nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions: measurement-induced transitions between volume- and area-law-entangled steady states and control-induced transitions where the system falls into an absorbing state, or an orbit visiting several absorbing states. Within this context, nonlocal conditional operations can alter the critical properties of the two transitions and the topology of the phase diagram. Here, we consider the scenario where the measurements are nonlocal, to engineer efficient control onto dynamical trajectories. Motivated by Rydberg-atom arrays, we consider a locally constrained model with global sublattice magnetization measurements and local correction operations to steer the system's dynamics onto a many-body orbit. The model has a well-defined classical limit, which we leverage to aid our analysis of the control transition. As a function of the density of local correction operations, we find control and entanglement transitions with continuously varying critical exponents. For sufficiently high densities of local correction operations, we find that both transitions acquire a dynamical critical exponent $z&lt;1$, reminiscent of criticality in long-range power-law interacting systems. At low correction densities, we find that the criticality reverts to a short-range nature with $z\gtrsim 1$. In the long-range regime, the control and entanglement transitions are indistinguishable to within the resolution of our numerics, while in the short-range regime we find evidence that the transitions become distinct. We conjecture that the long-range criticality mediated by collective measurements is essential in driving the two transitions together.</description>

      <title>Manifold-based transformation of probability distributions: application to the inverse problem of reconstructing distributions from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information geometry is a mathematical framework that elucidates the manifold structure of the probability distribution space (p-space), providing a systematic approach to transforming probability distributions (PDs). In this study, we utilized information geometry to address the inverse problems associated with reconstructing PDs from experimental data. Our initial finding is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, often considered non-metric owing to its asymmetry, can serve as a valid metric under specific geometric conditions on the manifold. Based on this finding, we formulated the manifold-based gradient descent (MBGD) method, which was employed to visualize the internal structures -- represented as PDs -- of two types of systems: those with static constituent elements and those with dynamic state transitions. Through the application of MBGD, we successfully reconstructed the underlying PDs for both types of systems, outperforming the standard gradient descent methods that neglect the manifold structure of p-space. Therefore, the present results demonstrate the essentiality of accounting for the manifold structure of p-space in the inverse problems of reconstructing PDs. The ability of MBGD to accurately reconstruct PDs for systems with dynamic state transitions underscores its potential to provide valuable physical insights by visualizing internal structures.</description>

      <title>Equations of state and stability condition of mixed p-spin glass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) is a foundational model for understanding spin glass systems. It is based on the pairwise interaction between each two spins in a fully connected lattice with quenched disordered interactions. The nature of long-range interaction among spins in the (SK) model simplifies the study of this system by eliminating fluctuations. An advanced (SK) model, known as the p-spin model, introduces higher-order interactions that involve the interaction of P spins. This research focuses on the general Hamiltonian of the spin glass model with long-range interaction, referred to as the mixed p-spin glass model, which consists of adding all p-spin interaction terms. This research aims to derive the equation of states for this Hamiltonian, formulate the equation of state within the framework of the first replica symmetry breaking, and determine both the stability condition of the replica symmetric solution and the stability of the replicas belonging to the same group in the first step of replica symmetry breaking.</description>
