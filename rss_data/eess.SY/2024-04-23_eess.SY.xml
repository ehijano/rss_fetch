      <title>Optimal Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: Integrating Public Charging Networks and Transportation Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) marks a pivotal shift in personal mobility, driven by policy incentives and automotive innovations. However, the expansion of EVs for long-distance travel is hindered by charging time concerns, the sparse distribution of charging stations, and the worsening waiting times due to congestion. The main objective of this work is two-fold: 1) first, to comprehensively analyze the existing public charging station robustness and effectively strategize for the new ones, and 2) secondly, to select the optimal chargers for long-distance journeys, by estimating the waiting time from current traffic congestion. This is achieved by accompanying effective EV charging strategies, pinpointing on the congestion points from the existing traffic, and the robustness of the current charging station infrastructure. Utilizing a real-time transportation and charging station dataset in Texas, we identify optimal charger placement strategies to minimize travel time by examining the congestion and charging time trade-offs. Our findings suggest that maximizing the constant current phase during charging enhances efficiency, crucial for long-distance travel. On the contrary, we also explore the negative impact of congestion on travel times and we conclude that sometimes it might be beneficial to exceed the constant current phase to avoid the congested charging stations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on optimizing the design parameters of a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) converter for use in 350 kW DC fast chargers, emphasizing the balance between efficiency and cost. Addressing the observed gaps in existing high-power application research, it introduces an optimization framework to evaluate critical design parameters,number of converter modules, switching frequency, and transformer turns ratio,within a broad operational voltage range. The analysis identifies an optimal configuration that achieves over 95% efficiency at rated power across a wide output voltage range, comprising seven 50 kW DAB converters with a switching frequency of 30 kHz, and a transformer turns ratio of 0.9.</description>

      <title>A general framework for supporting economic feasibility of generator and storage energy systems through capacity and dispatch optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of various electricity generating technologies (such as natural gas, wind, nuclear, etc.) with storage systems (such as thermal, battery electric, hydrogen, etc.) has the potential to improve the economic competitiveness of modern energy systems. Driven by the need to efficiently assess the economic feasibility of various energy system configurations in early system concept development, this work outlines a versatile computational framework for assessing the net present value of various integrated storage technologies. The subsystems' fundamental dynamics are defined, with a particular emphasis on balancing critical physical and economic domains to enable optimal decision-making in the context of capacity and dispatch optimization. In its presented form, the framework formulates a linear, convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved using a direct transcription approach in the open-source software DTQP. Three case studies are considered to demonstrate and validate the capabilities of the framework, highlighting its value and computational efficiency in facilitating economic assessment of various configurations of energy systems. In particular, natural gas with thermal storage and carbon capture, wind energy with battery storage, and nuclear with hydrogen are demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of memory sampling in status updating systems, where source updates are published in shared memory, and reader process samples the memory for source updates by paying a sampling cost. We formulate a discrete-time decision problem to find a sampling policy that minimizes average cost comprising age at the client and the cost incurred due to sampling. We establish that an optimal policy is a stationary and deterministic threshold-type policy, and subsequently derive optimal threshold and the corresponding optimal average cost.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bayesian Optimization for High-Precision Motion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controller tuning and parameter optimization are crucial in system design to improve closed-loop system performance. Bayesian optimization has been established as an efficient model-free controller tuning and adaptation method. However, Bayesian optimization methods are computationally expensive and therefore difficult to use in real-time critical scenarios. In this work, we propose a real-time purely data-driven, model-free approach for adaptive control, by online tuning low-level controller parameters. We base our algorithm on GoOSE, an algorithm for safe and sample-efficient Bayesian optimization, for handling performance and stability criteria. We introduce multiple computational and algorithmic modifications for computational efficiency and parallelization of optimization steps. We further evaluate the algorithm's performance on a real precision-motion system utilized in semiconductor industry applications by modifying the payload and reference stepsize and comparing it to an interpolated constrained optimization-based baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Enhancing High-Speed Cruising Performance of Autonomous Vehicles through Integrated Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed cruising scenarios with mixed traffic greatly challenge the road safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Unlike existing works that only look at fundamental modules in isolation, this work enhances AV safety in mixed-traffic high-speed cruising scenarios by proposing an integrated framework that synthesizes three fundamental modules, i.e., behavioral decision-making, path-planning, and motion-control modules. Considering that the integrated framework would increase the system complexity, a bootstrapped deep Q-Network (DQN) is employed to enhance the deep exploration of the reinforcement learning method and achieve adaptive decision making of AVs. Moreover, to make AV behavior understandable by surrounding HDVs to prevent unexpected operations caused by misinterpretations, we derive an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach to learn the reward function of skilled drivers for the path planning of lane-changing maneuvers. Such a design enables AVs to achieve a human-like tradeoff between multi-performance requirements. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed integrated framework can guide AVs to take safe actions while guaranteeing high-speed cruising performance.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cooperation for Energy-efficient Connectivity via Wireless Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of incentivizing energy-constrained, non-cooperative user equipment (UE) to serve as cooperative relays. We consider a source UE with a non-line-of-sight channel to an access point (AP), where direct communication may be infeasible or may necessitate a substantial transmit power. Other UEs in the vicinity are viewed as relay candidates, and our aim is to enable energy-efficient connectivity for the source, while accounting for the self-interested behavior and private channel state information of these candidates, by allowing the source to "pay" the candidates via wireless power transfer (WPT). We propose a cooperation-inducing protocol, inspired by Myerson auction theory, which ensures that candidates truthfully report power requirements while minimizing the expected power used by the source. Through rigorous analysis, we establish the regularity of valuations for lognormal fading channels, which allows for the efficient determination of the optimal source transmit power. Extensive simulation experiments, employing real-world communication and WPT parameters, validate our theoretical framework. Our results demonstrate a 91% reduction in outage probability with as few as 4 relay candidates, compared to the non-cooperative scenario, and as much as 48% source power savings compared to a baseline approach, highlighting the efficacy of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications. However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how unmanned vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potentials at this intersection.</description>

      <title>Remaining Energy Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have found their way into myriad sectors of industry to drive electrification, decarbonization, and sustainability. A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy state. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The results from our experiments show that the proposed approach offers high prediction accuracy and amenability to training and computation.</description>

      <title>PRoTECT: Parallelized Construction of Safety Barrier Certificates for Nonlinear Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an open-source software tool, called PRoTECT, for the parallelized construction of safety barrier certificates (BCs) for nonlinear polynomial systems. This tool employs sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs to systematically search for polynomial-type BCs, while aiming to verify safety properties over four classes of dynamical systems: (i) discrete-time stochastic systems, (ii) discrete-time deterministic systems, (iii) continuous-time stochastic systems, and (iv) continuous-time deterministic systems. PRoTECT is implemented in Python as an application programming interface (API), offering users the flexibility to interact either through its user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) or via function calls from other Python programs. PRoTECT leverages parallelism across different barrier degrees to efficiently search for a feasible BC.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic forecasting of power system imbalance using neural network-based ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keeping the balance between electricity generation and consumption is becoming increasingly challenging and costly, mainly due to the rising share of renewables, electric vehicles and heat pumps and electrification of industrial processes. Accurate imbalance forecasts, along with reliable uncertainty estimations, enable transmission system operators (TSOs) to dispatch appropriate reserve volumes, reducing balancing costs. Further, market parties can use these probabilistic forecasts to design strategies that exploit asset flexibility to help balance the grid, generating revenue with known risks. Despite its importance, literature regarding system imbalance (SI) forecasting is limited. Further, existing methods do not focus on situations with high imbalance magnitude, which are crucial to forecast accurately for both TSOs and market parties. Hence, we propose an ensemble of C-VSNs, which are our adaptation of variable selection networks (VSNs). Each minute, our model predicts the imbalance of the current and upcoming two quarter-hours, along with uncertainty estimations on these forecasts. We evaluate our approach by forecasting the imbalance of Belgium, where high imbalance magnitude is defined as $|$SI$| &gt; 500\,$MW (occurs 1.3% of the time in Belgium). For high imbalance magnitude situations, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by 23.4% (in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), which evaluates probabilistic forecasts), while also attaining a 6.5% improvement in overall CRPS. Similar improvements are achieved in terms of root-mean-squared error. Additionally, we developed a fine-tuning methodology to effectively include new inputs with limited history in our model. This work was performed in collaboration with Elia (the Belgian TSO) to further improve their imbalance forecasts, demonstrating the relevance of our work.</description>

      <title>A novel mathematical model for predicting the benefits of physical activity on type 2 diabetes progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the well-acknowledged benefits of physical activity for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention, the literature surprisingly lacks validated models able to predict the long-term benefits of exercise on T2D progression and support personalized risk prediction and prevention. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel mathematical model that formalizes the link between exercise and short- and long-term glucose-insulin dynamics to predict the benefits of regular exercise on T2D progression. The model quantitatively captured the dose-response relationship (larger benefits with increasing intensity and/or duration of exercise), it consistently reproduced the benefits of clinical guidelines for diabetes prevention, and it accurately predicted persistent benefits following interruption of physical activity, in line with real-world evidence from the literature. These results are encouraging and can be the basis for future development of decision support tools able to assist patients and clinicians in tailoring preventive lifestyle interventions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports on the modeling, fabrication, and experimental characterization of a 13 GHz 30% Scandium-doped Aluminum Nitride (ScAlN) Overmoded Bulk Acoustic Resonator (OBAR) for high-frequency Radio Frequency (RF) applications, notably in 5G technology and beyond. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) optimization process targets the top and bottom metal electrode thicknesses, balancing the electromechanical coupling coefficient and acoustic energy distribution to enhance device Figure of Merit (FOM). Experimental results on fabricated devices employing platinum and aluminum as bottom and top electrode, respectively, demonstrate a quality factor at resonance (Qs) of 210 and a coupling coefficient (kt2) of 5.2% at 13.3 GHz for the second bulk thickness overtone, effectively validating the simulation framework and hinting at the possible implementation of OBARs for advanced RF filters in 5G networks.</description>

      <title>Securing O-RAN Open Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of cellular networks will be characterized by openness, intelligence, virtualization, and distributed computing. The Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN) framework represents a significant leap toward realizing these ideals, with prototype deployments taking place in both academic and industrial domains. While it holds the potential to disrupt the established vendor lock-ins, Open RAN's disaggregated nature raises critical security concerns. Safeguarding data and securing interfaces must be integral to Open RAN's design, demanding meticulous analysis of cost/benefit tradeoffs.
  In this paper, we embark on the first comprehensive investigation into the impact of encryption on two pivotal Open RAN interfaces: the E2 interface, connecting the base station with a near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller, and the Open Fronthaul, connecting the Radio Unit to the Distributed Unit. Our study leverages a full-stack O-RAN ALLIANCE compliant implementation within the Colosseum network emulator and a production-ready Open RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular network. This research contributes quantitative insights into the latency introduced and throughput reduction stemming from using various encryption protocols. Furthermore, we present four fundamental principles for constructing security by design within Open RAN systems, offering a roadmap for navigating the intricate landscape of Open RAN security.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Data-Driven Output Predictors in the Output Error Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of predicting the output of an LTI system directly using offline input-output data (and without the use of a parametric model) in the behavioral setting. Existing works calculate the output predictions by projecting the recent samples of the input and output signals onto the column span of a Hankel matrix consisting of the offline input-output data. However, if the offline data is corrupted by noise, the output prediction is no longer exact. While some prior works propose mitigating noisy data through matrix low-ranking approximation heuristics, such as truncated singular value decomposition, the ensuing prediction accuracy remains unquantified. This paper fills these gaps by introducing two upper bounds on the prediction error under the condition that the noise is sufficiently small relative to the offline data's magnitude. The first bound pertains to prediction using the raw offline data directly, while the second one applies to the case of low-ranking approximation heuristic. Notably, the bounds do not require the ground truth about the system output, relying solely on noisy measurements with a known noise level and system order. Extensive numerical simulations show that both bounds decrease monotonically (and linearly) as a function of the noise level. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that applying the de-noising heuristic in the output error setup does not generally lead to a better prediction accuracy as compared to using raw data directly, nor a smaller upper bound on the prediction error. However, it allows for a more general upper bound, as the first upper bound requires a specific condition on the partitioning of the Hankel matrix.</description>

      <title>Integrating Disambiguation and User Preferences into Large Language Models for Robot Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework that can interpret humans' navigation commands containing temporal elements and directly translate their natural language instructions into robot motion planning. Central to our framework is utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reliability of LLMs in the framework and improve user experience, we propose methods to resolve the ambiguity in natural language instructions and capture user preferences. The process begins with an ambiguity classifier, identifying potential uncertainties in the instructions. Ambiguous statements trigger a GPT-4-based mechanism that generates clarifying questions, incorporating user responses for disambiguation. Also, the framework assesses and records user preferences for non-ambiguous instructions, enhancing future interactions. The last part of this process is the translation of disambiguated instructions into a robot motion plan using Linear Temporal Logic. This paper details the development of this framework and the evaluation of its performance in various test scenarios.</description>

      <title>Human Behavior Modeling via Identification of Task Objective and Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human behavior modeling is important for the design and implementation of human-automation interactive control systems. In this context, human behavior refers to a human's control input to systems. We propose a novel method for human behavior modeling that uses human demonstrations for a given task to infer the unknown task objective and the variability. The task objective represents the human's intent or desire. It can be inferred by the inverse optimal control and improve the understanding of human behavior by providing an explainable objective function behind the given human behavior. Meanwhile, the variability denotes the intrinsic uncertainty in human behavior. It can be described by a Gaussian mixture model and capture the uncertainty in human behavior which cannot be encoded by the task objective. The proposed method can improve the prediction accuracy of human behavior by leveraging both task objective and variability. The proposed method is demonstrated through human-subject experiments using an illustrative quadrotor remote control example.</description>

      <title>Antifragile control systems in neuronal processing: A sensorimotor perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability--robustness--resilience--adaptiveness continuum in neuronal processing follows a hierarchical structure that explains interactions and information processing among the different time scales. Interestingly, using "canonical" neuronal computational circuits, such as Homeostatic Activity Regulation, Winner-Take-All, and Hebbian Temporal Correlation Learning, one can extend the behaviour spectrum towards antifragility. Cast already in both probability theory and dynamical systems, antifragility can explain and define the interesting interplay among neural circuits, found, for instance, in sensorimotor control in the face of uncertainty and volatility. This perspective proposes a new framework to analyse and describe closed-loop neuronal processing using principles of antifragility, targeting sensorimotor control. Our objective is two-fold. First, we introduce antifragile control as a conceptual framework to quantify closed-loop neuronal network behaviours that gain from uncertainty and volatility. Second, we introduce neuronal network design principles, opening the path to neuromorphic implementations and transfer to technical systems.</description>

      <title>A Realisation of Channel Emulation in a Reverberation Chamber method for Over-the-Air Compliance Testing in Support of 3GPP Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent long decay power delay profile (PDP) in the reverberation chamber (RC) is a major challenge for accurate channel emulation of 3GPP channel model, which is widely used in performance test of the physical layer. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel two-step "closed-loop" approach consisting of (i) a channel measuring step and (ii) a channel model synthesis step. The channel measurement step is used to capture the wireless channel of the RC. In the channel model synthesis step, an additional IQ signal convolution process is introduced prior the IQ signal passes through the channel emulator (CE). This process filters the IQ signal by an equalizer filter derived from the measured channel impulse response (CIR) of the RC obtained in channel measurement step. From the measurement results, the proposed approach is proven that able to effectively emulate typical 3GPP 5G channel model.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tier Non-Terrestrial Networking for Disaster Communications: A Layered Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is crucial to deploy temporary non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in disaster situations where terrestrial networks are no longer operable. Deploying uncrewed aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) can provide a radio access network (RAN); however, the backhaul link may also be damaged and unserviceable in such disaster conditions. In this regard, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) spark attention as they can be deployed as super macro base stations (SMBS) and data centers. Therefore, in this study, we investigate a three-layer heterogeneous network with different topologies to prolong the lifespan of the temporary network by using UAV-BSs for RAN services and HAPS-SMBS as a backhaul. Furthermore, a two-layer clustering algorithm is proposed to handle the UAV-BS ad-hoc networking effectively.</description>

      <title>TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: By counting the number of pass/fail occurrences of a DUT (Device under Test) in the stirring process in a reverberation chamber (RC), the threshold electric field (E-field) level can be well estimated without tuning the input power and repeating the whole testing many times. The Monte-Carlo method is used to verify the results. Estimated values and uncertainties are given for Rayleigh distributed fields and for Rice distributed fields with different K-factors.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of parameter estimation for large class of nonlinear systems, namely those in which the state consists of output derivatives and the flow is linear in the parameter. The method, which solves for the unknown parameter by directly inverting the dynamics using regularized linear regression, is based on new design and analysis ideas for differentiation filtering and regularized least squares. Combined in series, they yield a novel finite-sample bound on mean absolute error of estimation.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Scenario Testing for Autonomous Vehicles Based on Neighborhood Coverage and Similarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing and evaluating the safety performance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential before the large-scale deployment. Practically, the number of testing scenarios permissible for a specific AV is severely limited by tight constraints on testing budgets and time. With the restrictions imposed by strictly restricted numbers of tests, existing testing methods often lead to significant uncertainty or difficulty to quantifying evaluation results. In this paper, we formulate this problem for the first time the "few-shot testing" (FST) problem and propose a systematic framework to address this challenge. To alleviate the considerable uncertainty inherent in a small testing scenario set, we frame the FST problem as an optimization problem and search for the testing scenario set based on neighborhood coverage and similarity. Specifically, under the guidance of better generalization ability of the testing scenario set on AVs, we dynamically adjust this set and the contribution of each testing scenario to the evaluation result based on coverage, leveraging the prior information of surrogate models (SMs). With certain hypotheses on SMs, a theoretical upper bound of evaluation error is established to verify the sufficiency of evaluation accuracy within the given limited number of tests. The experiment results on cut-in scenarios demonstrate a notable reduction in evaluation error and variance of our method compared to conventional testing methods, especially for situations with a strict limit on the number of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Population Games: A Tractable Intersection of Mean-Field Games and Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.14662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world large-scale decision problems, self-interested agents have individual dynamics and optimize their own long-term payoffs. Important examples include the competitive access to shared resources (e.g., roads, energy, or bandwidth) but also non-engineering domains like epidemic propagation and control. These problems are natural to model as mean-field games. However, existing mathematical formulations of mean field games have had limited applicability in practice, since they require solving non-standard initial-terminal-value problems that are tractable only in limited special cases. In this letter, we propose a novel formulation, along with computational tools, for a practically relevant class of Dynamic Population Games (DPGs), which correspond to discrete-time, finite-state-and-action, stationary mean-field games. Our main contribution is a mathematical reduction of Stationary Nash Equilibria (SNE) in DPGs to standard Nash Equilibria (NE) in static population games. This reduction is leveraged to guarantee the existence of a SNE, develop an evolutionary dynamics-based SNE computation algorithm, and derive simple conditions that guarantee stability and uniqueness of the SNE. Additionally, DPGs enable us to tractably incorporate multiple agent types, which is of particular importance to assess fairness concerns in resource allocation problems. We demonstrate our results by computing the SNE in two complex application examples: fair resource allocation with heterogeneous agents and control of epidemic propagation.

      <title>Parameter-Conditioned Reachable Sets for Updating Safety Assurances Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a powerful tool for analyzing the safety of autonomous systems. However, the provided safety assurances are often predicated on the assumption that once deployed, the system or its environment does not evolve. Online, however, an autonomous system might experience changes in system dynamics, control authority, external disturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safety assurances. Rather than restarting the safety analysis from scratch, which can be time-consuming and often intractable to perform online, we propose to compute \textit{parameter-conditioned} reachable sets. Assuming expected system and environment changes can be parameterized, we treat these parameters as virtual states in the system and leverage recent advances in high-dimensional reachability analysis to solve the corresponding reachability problem offline. This results in a family of reachable sets that is parameterized by the environment and system factors. Online, as these factors change, the system can simply query the corresponding safety function from this family to ensure system safety, enabling a real-time update of the safety assurances. Through various simulation studies, we demonstrate the capability of our approach in maintaining system safety despite the system and environment evolution.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Learning of Stochastic Differential Equations with Non-asymptotic Fast Rates of Convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For parameterized mixed-binary optimization problems, we construct local decision rules that prescribe near-optimal courses of action across a set of parameter values. The decision rules stem from solving risk-adaptive training problems over classes of continuous, possibly nonlinear mappings. In asymptotic and nonasymptotic analysis, we establish that the decision rules prescribe near-optimal decisions locally for the actual problems, without relying on linearity, convexity, or smoothness. The development also accounts for practically important aspects such as inexact function evaluations, solution tolerances in training problems, regularization, and reformulations to solver-friendly models. The decision rules also furnish a means to carry out sensitivity and stability analysis for broad classes of parameterized optimization problems. We develop a decomposition algorithm for solving the resulting training problems and demonstrate its ability to generate quality decision rules on a nonlinear binary optimization model from search theory.</description>

Abstract: There exist a wide range of options for field robotics research using ground and aerial mobile robots, but there are comparatively few robust and research-ready uncrewed surface vessels (USVs). This workshop paper starts with a snapshot of USVs currently available to the research community and then describes "OtterROS", an open source ROS 2 solution for the Otter USV. Field experiments using OtterROS are described, which highlight the utility of the Otter USV and the benefits of using ROS 2 in aquatic robotics research. For those interested in USV research, the paper details recommended hardware to run OtterROS and includes an example ROS 2 package using OtterROS, removing unnecessary non-recurring engineering from field robotics research activities.</description>
