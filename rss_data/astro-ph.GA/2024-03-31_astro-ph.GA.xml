      <title>The Molecular Clouds of M31</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep interferometric observations of CO and dust continuum emission are obtained with the Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) at 230 GHz to investigate the physical nature of the giant molecular cloud (GMC) population in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We use J = 2-1 $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission to derive the masses, sizes and velocity dispersions of 162 spatially resolved GMCs. We perform a detailed study of a subset of 117 GMCs that exhibit simple, single component line profile shapes. Examining the Larson scaling relations for these GMCs we find: 1- a highly correlated mass-size relation in both $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO emission; 2- a weakly correlated $^{12}$CO linewidth-size (LWS) relation along with a weaker, almost non-existent, $^{13}$CO LWS relation, suggesting a possible dependence of the LWS relation on spatial scale; and 3-that only 43\% of these GMCs are gravitationally bound. We identify two classes of GMCs based on the strength and extent of their $^{13}$CO emission. Examination of the Larson relations finds that both classes are individually characterized by strong $^{12}$CO mass-size relations and much weaker $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO LWS relations. The majority (73\%) of strong $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are found to be gravitationally bound. However, only 25\% of the weak $^{13}$CO emitting GMCs are bound. The resulting breakdown in the Larson relations in the weak $^{13}$CO emitting population decouples the mass-size and LWS relations demonstrating that independent physical causes are required to understand the origin of each. Finally, in nearly every aspect, the physical properties of the M31 GMCs are found to be very similar to those of local Milky Way clouds.</description>

      <title>Large-field CO (J=1-0) observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular environment of the supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5, and explore its association with ambient molecular clouds (MCs). Methods. We present large-field CO (J=1-0) molecular line observations toward SNR G150.3+4.5, using the 13.7 m millimeter telescope of the Purple Mountain Observatory. The observations have an angular resolution of $\sim 55 ''$. We analyzed the spatial distribution of MCs in relation to the SNR shell detected in previous Urumqi $\lambda$ 6 cm radio observations and examined the CO spectra for kinematics information. Results. We find that MCs at the velocity range of [-14, -2] km s$^{-1}$ are spatially distributed along the radio shell of the SNR. Line broadening and asymmetries are observed in the CO spectra of the clouds. Moreover, we find that the molecular clouds around the shell have systematic velocity gradients in the position-velocity (PV) diagrams. Both morphology alignment and gas kinematics suggest that the SNR is associated with the ambient MCs at $\sim$ 740 pc. Based on the CO gas distance, the dimension and the age of the SNR is estimated to be 40 pc $\times$ 33 pc and 3.8 $ \times 10^4$ years, respectively. The very high energy emission of 1LHAASO J0428+5531 toward the SNR may originate from the interaction between the SNR and the surrounding MCs.</description>

      <title>Adventures in Andromeda: The Interplay of Interstellar Dust and Gas in our Big Neighbour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we examine the interplay of interstellar dust and gas in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). In Chapter 2, we use $^{12}$CO CARMA observations of M31 and dust mass surface density measurements from the Bayesian algorithm PPMAP to investigate whether the dust emissivity index ($\beta$) is different inside and outside molecular clouds. We find little difference between the average $\beta$ inside molecular clouds compared to outside molecular clouds, in disagreement with models which predict an increase of $\beta$ in dense environments. In Chapter 3, we use submillimetre observations of M31 at 450 and 850 $\mu$m from the HASHTAG large programme and present first results of the spatial distribution of dust temperature, $\beta$ and dust mass surface density from this survey. We search for any excess emission from dust at these wavelengths and do not find strong evidence for the presence of a sub-mm excess. In Chapter 4, we produce a new dust-selected cloud catalogue using archival Herschel observations and HASHTAG observations. We show that dust is a good tracer of the ISM gas mass at the scale of individual molecular clouds but with an offset from the combined CO-traced + HI gas masses. In Chapter 5, we measure the star formation efficiency (SFE) of individual clouds, for the clouds extracted in Chapter 4, by using FUV+24 $\mu$m emission to trace both the massive star formation and dust-obscured star formation. We do not find any systematic trends of SFE with radius but do find strong correlations of the star formation rate with atomic gas and molecular gas. We find that SFE is correlated with dust temperature and $\beta$. In Chapter 6, we use a simulated galaxy to test and optimise the Bayesian algorithm PPMAP for application on observations of external galaxies. We find an offset between the input simulation dust mass surface density values and the PPMAP output.</description>

      <title>Molecular Gas and the Star Formation Process on Cloud Scales in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations that resolve nearby galaxies into individual regions across multiple phases of the gas-star formation-feedback ``matter cycle'' have provided a sharp new view of molecular clouds, star formation efficiencies, timescales for region evolution, and stellar feedback. We synthesize these results, cover aspects relevant to the interpretation of observables, and conclude that:
  (1) The observed cloud-scale molecular gas surface density, line width, and internal pressure all reflect the large-scale galactic environment while also appearing mostly consistent with properties of a turbulent medium strongly affected by self-gravity.
  (2) Cloud-scale data allow for statistical inference of both evolutionary and physical timescales. These suggest that clouds collapse on timescale of order the free-fall or turbulent crossing time ($\sim 10{-}30$~Myr) followed by the formation of massive stars and subsequent rapid ($\lesssim$ 5 Myr) gas clearing. The star formation efficiency per free-fall time is well determined over thousands of regions to be $\epsilon_{\rm ff}\approx 0.5_{-0.3}^{+0.7}\%$.
  (3) The role of stellar feedback is now measured using multiple observational approaches. The net momentum yield is constrained by the requirement to support the vertical weight of the galaxy disk. Meanwhile, the short gas clearing timescales suggest a large role for pre-supernova feedback in cloud disruption. This leaves the supernovae free to exert a large influence on the larger scale galaxy, including driving turbulence, launching galactic-scale winds, and carving superbubbles.</description>

      <title>The impact of void-finding algorithms on galaxy classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the definition of a void influences the conclusions drawn about the impact of the void environment on galactic properties using two void-finding algorithms in the Void Analysis Software Toolkit: V2, a Python implementation of ZOBOV, and VoidFinder, an algorithm which grows and merges spherical void regions. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, we find that galaxies found in VoidFinder voids tend to be bluer, fainter, and have higher (specific) star formation rates than galaxies in denser regions. Conversely, galaxies found in V2 voids show no significant differences when compared to galaxies in denser regions, inconsistent with the large-scale environmental effects on galaxy properties expected from both simulations and previous observations. These results align with previous simulation results that show V2-identified voids "leaking" into the dense walls between voids because their boundaries extend up to the density maxima in the walls. As a result, when using ZOBOV-based void finders, galaxies likely to be part of wall regions are instead classified as void galaxies, a misclassification that can be critical to our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Foreground Dust Properties towards the Cluster NGC 7380</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using starlight polarization, we present the properties of foreground dust towards cluster NGC 7380 embedded in H{\sc ii} region Sh 2-142. Observations of starlight polarization are carried out in four filters using an imaging polarimeter equipped with a 104-cm ARIES telescope. Polarization vectors of stars are aligned along the Galactic magnetic field. Towards the east and southeast regions, the dust structure appears much denser than in other regions (inferred from extinction contours and colour composite image) and is also reflected in polarization distribution. We find that the polarization degree and extinction tend to increase with distance and indication for the presence of a dust layer at a distance of around 1.2 $kpc$. We have identified eight potential candidates exhibiting intrinsic polarization by employing three distinct criteria to distinguish between stars of intrinsic polarization and interstellar polarized stars. For interstellar polarized stars, we find that the maximum polarization degree increases with the color excess and has a strong scatter, with the mean value of 1.71$\pm$0.57$\%$. The peak wavelength spans $0.40-0.88\mu$m with the mean value of 0.56$\pm$0.07 $\mu m$, suggesting similar grain sizes in the region as the average diffuse interstellar medium. The polarization efficiency is also found to decrease with visual extinction as $P_{max}/A_{V}\propto A_{V}^{-0.61}$. Our observational results are found to be consistent with the predictions by the radiative torque alignment theory.</description>

      <title>Bias versus variance when fitting multi-species molecular lines with a non-LTE radiative transfer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust radiative transfer techniques are requisite for efficiently extracting the physical and chemical information from molecular rotational lines.We study several hypotheses that enable robust estimations of the column densities and physical conditions when fitting one or two transitions per molecular species. We study the extent to which simplifying assumptions aimed at reducing the complexity of the problem introduce estimation biases and how to detect them.We focus on the CO and HCO+ isotopologues and analyze maps of a 50 square arcminutes field. We used the RADEX escape probability model to solve the statistical equilibrium equations and compute the emerging line profiles, assuming that all species coexist. Depending on the considered set of species, we also fixed the abundance ratio between some species and explored different values. We proposed a maximum likelihood estimator to infer the physical conditions and considered the effect of both the thermal noise and calibration uncertainty. We analyzed any potential biases induced by model misspecifications by comparing the results on the actual data for several sets of species and confirmed with Monte Carlo simulations. The variance of the estimations and the efficiency of the estimator were studied based on the Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bound.Column densities can be estimated with 30% accuracy, while the best estimations of the volume density are found to be within a factor of two. Under the chosen model framework, the peak 12CO(1--0) is useful for constraining the kinetic temperature. The thermal pressure is better and more robustly estimated than the volume density and kinetic temperature separately. Analyzing CO and HCO+ isotopologues and fitting the full line profile are recommended practices with respect to detecting possible biases.Combining a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium model with a rigorous analysis of the accuracy allows us to obtain an efficient estimator and identify where the model is misspecified. We note that other combinations of molecular lines could be studied in the future.</description>

      <title>Balmer Decrement Anomalies in Galaxies at z ~ 6 Found by JWST Observations: Density-Bounded Nebulae or Excited H I Clouds?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical origins of the Balmer decrement anomalies in GS-NDG-9422 (Cameron et al. 2023) and RXCJ2248-ID (Topping et al. 2024) galaxies at $z\sim 6$ whose $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ values are significantly smaller than $2.7$, the latter of which also shows anomalous $\mathrm{H}\gamma/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\delta/\mathrm{H}\beta$ values beyond the errors. Because the anomalous Balmer decrements are not reproduced under the Case B recombination, we explore the nebulae with the optical depths smaller and larger than the Case B recombination by physical modeling. We find two cases quantitatively explaining the anomalies; 1) density-bounded nebulae that are opaque only up to around Ly$\gamma$-Ly8 transitions and 2) ionization-bounded nebulae partly/fully surrounded by optically-thick excited H{\sc i} clouds. The case of 1) produces more H$\beta$ photons via Ly$\gamma$ absorption in the nebulae, requiring fine tuning in optical depth values, while this case helps ionizing photon escape for cosmic reionization. The case of 2) needs the optically-thick excited H{\sc i} clouds with $N_2\simeq 10^{12}-10^{13}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, where $N_2$ is the column density of the hydrogen atom with the principal quantum number of $n=2$. Interestingly, the high $N_2$ values qualitatively agree with the recent claims for GS-NDG-9422 with the strong nebular continuum requiring a number of $2s$-state electrons and for RXCJ2248-ID with the dense ionized regions likely coexisting with the optically-thick clouds. While the physical origin of the optically-thick excited H{\sc i} clouds is unclear, these results may suggest gas clouds with excessive collisional excitation caused by an amount of accretion and supernovae in the high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>FOOD I: A New Division Scheme For The Stelliferous Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled the frontier of observational galaxy formation to push to ever higher redshift, deep within cosmic dawn. However, what is high-redshift, and when was cosmic dawn? While widely used, these terms (as well as many other confusing terms) are not consistently defined in the literature; this both hampers effective communication but also impedes our ability to precisely characterize and understand the phenomena under investigation. In this article we seek to address this issue of utmost importance. We begin by definitively defining terms such as ``high-redshift'', ``cosmic dawn'', etc. However, despite the rigorous definitions for them we present, both the adjective-based redshift and diurnal marker (time-of-day) division schemes suffer from issues including not being sufficiently granular, angering cosmologists, being arbitrary, and having a geocentric bias. To overcome these we introduce the \textit{redshiFt epOchs fOr everyboDy} (FOOD) framework, a revolutionary new division scheme based on eating occasions, i.e. meals.</description>

      <title>A catalogue of asteroseismically calibrated ages for APOGEE DR17. The predictions of a CatBoost machine learning model based on the [Mg/Ce] chemical clock and other stellar parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the Milky Way's formation and evolution across cosmic epochs necessitates precise stellar age determination across all Galactic components. Recent advancements in asteroseismology, spectroscopy, stellar modelling, and machine learning, coupled with all-sky surveys, now offer highly reliable stellar age estimates. Aims. This study aims to furnish accurate age assessments for the Main Red Star Sample within the APOGEE DR17 catalogue. Leveraging asteroseismic age constraints, we employ machine learning to achieve this goal. Methods. We explore optimal non-asteroseismic stellar parameters, including T$_{eff}$, L, [CI/N], [Mg/Ce], [$\alpha$/Fe], U(LSR) velocity, and 'Z' vertical height from the Galactic plane, to predict ages via categorical gradient boost decision trees. Training merges samples from the TESS Southern Continuous Viewing Zone and Second APOKASC catalogue to mitigate data shifts, enhancing prediction reliability. Validation employs an independent dataset from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program. Results. Our model yields a median fractional age error of 20.8%, with a prediction variance of 4.77%. Median fractional errors for stars older than 3 Gyr range from 7% to 23%, from 1 to 3 Gyr range from 26% to 28%, and for stars younger than 1 Gyr, it's 43%. Applicable to 125,445 stars in the APOGEE DR17 Main Red Star Sample, our analysis confirms previous findings on the young Galactic disc's flaring and reveals an age gradient among the youngest Galactic plane stars. Additionally, we identify two groups of metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; -1 dex) young stars (Age &lt; 2 Gyr) exhibiting similar chemical abundances and halo kinematics, likely remnants of the predicted third gas infall episode (~2.7 Gyr ago).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multi-line Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) has emerged as a promising tool for probing the 3D large-scale structure (LSS) through the aggregate emission of spectral lines. The presence of interloper lines poses a crucial challenge in extracting the signal from the target line in LIM. In this work, we introduce a novel method for LIM analysis that simultaneously extracts line signals from multiple spectral lines, utilizing the covariance of native LIM data elements defined in the spectral-angular space. We leverage correlated information from different lines to perform joint inference on all lines simultaneously, employing a Bayesian analysis framework. We present the formalism, demonstrate our technique with a mock survey setup resembling the SPHEREx deep field observation, and consider four spectral lines within the SPHEREx spectral coverage in the near infrared: H$\alpha$, $[$\ion{O}{3}$]$, H$\beta$, and $[$\ion{O}{2}$]$. We demonstrate that our method can extract the power spectrum of all four lines at $\gtrsim 10\sigma$ level at $z&lt;2$. For the brightest line H$\alpha$, the $10\sigma$ sensitivity can be achieved out to $z\sim3$. Our technique offers a flexible framework for LIM analysis, enabling simultaneous inference of signals from multiple line emissions while accommodating diverse modeling constraints and parametrizations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a machine learning-based method for extracting HI sources from 3D spectral data, and construct a dedicated dataset of HI sources from CRAFTS. Our custom dataset provides comprehensive resources for HI source detection. Utilizing the 3D-Unet segmentation architecture, our method reliably identifies and segments HI sources, achieving notable performance metrics with recall rates reaching 91.6% and accuracy levels at 95.7%.

      <title>Stripe 82X Data Release 3: Multiwavelength Catalog with New Spectroscopic Redshifts and Black Hole Masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg$^2$) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1396 Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of $r&lt;22$. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened ($R-K &gt; 4$, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Unlike other surveys, there is only a 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have SDSS spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the H$\beta$, MgII, H$\alpha$, and CIV emission lines. We find systematic differences in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statiscal analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize systematic bias. We find that the highest luminosity AGN are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous ($L_{\rm 2-10 keV} &gt; 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$).</description>

Abstract: We report {\em JWST}/NIRCam measurements of quasar host galaxy emissions and supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses for six quasars at $5.9&lt;z&lt;7.1$ in the \textit{Emission-line galaxies and Intergalactic Gas in the Epoch of Reionization} (EIGER) project. We obtain deep NIRCam imaging in the F115W, F200W, and F356W bands, as well as F356W grism spectroscopy of the quasars. We use bright unsaturated stars to construct models of the point spread function (PSF) and estimate the errors of these PSFs. We then measure or constrain the fluxes and morphology of the quasar host galaxies by fitting the quasar images as a point source plus an exponential disk. We successfully detect the host galaxy of three quasars, which have host-to-quasar flux ratios of $\sim1\%-5\%$. Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting suggests that these quasar host galaxies have stellar masses of $M_*\gtrsim10^{10}M_\odot$. For quasars with host galaxy non-detections, we estimate the upper limits of their stellar masses. We use the grism spectra to measure the {\hb} line profile and the continuum luminosity, then estimate the SMBH masses for the quasars. Our results indicate that the positive relation between SMBH masses and host galaxy stellar masses already exists at redshift $z\gtrsim6$. The quasars in our sample show a high black hole to stellar mass ratio of $M_\text{BH}/M_*\sim0.15$, which is about $\sim2$ dex higher than local relations. We find that selection effects only contribute partially to the high $M_\text{BH}/M_*$ ratios of high-redshift quasars. This result hints at a possible redshift evolution of the $M_\text{BH}-M_*$ relation.</description>

      <title>Three regimes of black hole feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In theoretical models of galaxy evolution, black hole feedback is a necessary ingredient in order to explain the observed exponential decline in number density of massive galaxies. Most contemporary black hole feedback models in cosmological simulations rely on a constant radiative efficiency (usually $\eta \sim 0.1$) at all black hole accretion rates. We present a synthesis model for the spin-dependent radiative efficiencies of three physical accretion rate regimes, i.e. $\eta = \eta(j, \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc})$, for use in large-volume cosmological simulations. The three regimes include: an advection dominated accretion flow ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &lt; 0.03\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$), a quasar-like mode ($0.03 &lt; \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} / \dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd} &lt; 0.3$), and a slim disc mode ($\dot{M}_\mathrm{acc} &gt; 0.3\,\dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$). Additionally, we include a large-scale powerful jet at low accretion rates. The black hole feedback model we present is a kinetic model that prescribes mass loadings but could be used in thermal models directly using the radiative efficiency. We implemented our model into the \texttt{Simba} galaxy evolution model to determine if it is possible to reproduce galaxy populations successfully, and provide a first calibration for further study. Using a $2\times512^3$ particle cosmological simulation in a $(75\,\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume, we found that the model is successful in reproducing the galaxy stellar mass function, black hole mass-stellar mass relationship, and stellar mass-halo mass relationship. Moving forward, this model opens new avenues for exploration of the impact of black hole feedback on galactic environments.</description>

Abstract: Using the photometric population prediction method {\bf Red Dragon}, we characterize the Red Sequence (RS) and Blue Cloud (BC) of DES galaxies in the COSMOS field. Red Dragon (RD) uses a redshift-evolving, error-corrected Gaussian mixture model to detail the distribution of photometric colors, smoothly parameterizing the two populations with relative weights, mean colors, intrinsic scatters, and inter-color correlations. This resulting fit of RS and BC yields RS membership probabilities $P_{\rm RS}$ for each galaxy. Even when training on only DES main bands $griz$, RD selects the quiescent population (defined here as galaxies with $\lg {\rm sSFR \cdot yr} &lt; -11$) with $\gtrsim 90\%$ balanced accuracy out to $z=2$; augmenting with extended photometry from VIRCAM improves this accuracy to $\sim 95\%$ out to $z=3$. We measure redshift evolution of sSFR and galactic age in several stellar mass bins, finding that the BC is consistently more star-forming (by $\gtrsim 1~{\rm dex}$) and typically younger (by $\gtrsim 1~{\rm Gyr}$) than the RS (up to $z \sim 1.4$). This characterization of both RS and BC as functions of redshift and stellar mass improves our understanding of both populations and opens the door to more precise galaxy population characterization in future deep optical and IR systems.</description>

      <title>X-ray-inferred kinematics of the core ICM in Perseus-like clusters: Insights from the TNG-Cluster simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters encodes the impact of the physical processes that shape these massive halos, including feedback from central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). In this study, we examine the gas thermodynamics, kinematics, and the effects of SMBH feedback on the core of Perseus-like galaxy clusters with a new simulation suite: TNG-Cluster. We first make a selection of simulated clusters similar to Perseus based on the total mass and inner ICM properties, such as their cool-core nature. We identify 30 Perseus-like systems among the 352 TNG-Cluster halos at $z=0$. Many exhibit thermodynamical profiles and X-ray morphologies with disturbed features such as ripples, bubbles, and shock fronts that are qualitatively similar to X-ray observations of Perseus. To study observable gas motions, we generate XRISM mock X-ray observations and conduct a spectral analysis of the synthetic data. In agreement with existing Hitomi measurements, TNG-Cluster predicts subsonic gas turbulence in the central regions of Perseus-like clusters, with a typical line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 200 km/s. This implies that turbulent pressure contributes $&lt; 10\%$ to the dominant thermal pressure. In TNG-Cluster, such low (inferred) values of ICM velocity dispersion coexist with high-velocity outflows and bulk motions of relatively small amounts of super-virial hot gas, moving up to thousands of km/s. However, detecting these outflows in observations may prove challenging due to their anisotropic nature and projection effects. Driven by SMBH feedback, such outflows are responsible for many morphological disturbances in the X-ray maps of cluster cores. They also increase both the inferred and intrinsic ICM velocity dispersion. This effect is somewhat stronger when velocity dispersion is measured from higher-energy lines.</description>

      <title>MAGIC: Muse gAlaxy Groups In Cosmos -- A survey to probe the impact of environment on galaxy evolution over the last 8 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the MUSE gAlaxy Groups in COSMOS (MAGIC) survey, which was built to study the impact of environment on galaxy evolution over the last 8 Gyr. It consists of 17 MUSE fields targeting 14 massive structures at intermediate redshift ($0.3&lt;z&lt;0.8$) in the COSMOS area. We securely measured the redshifts for 1419 sources and identified 76 galaxy pairs and 67 groups of at least 3 members using a friends-of-friends algorithm. The environment of galaxies is quantified from group properties, as well as from global and local density estimators. The MAGIC survey has increased the number of objects with a secure spectroscopic redshift over its footprint by a factor of about 5. Most of the new redshifts have apparent magnitudes in the $z^{++}$ band $z_{app}^{++}&gt;21.5$. The spectroscopic redshift completeness is high: in the redshift range of [OII] emitters ($0.25 \le z &lt; 1.5$), where most of the groups are found, it globally reaches a maximum of 80% down to $z_{app}^{++}=25.9$, and locally decreases from $\sim 100$% to $\sim50$% in magnitude bins from $z_{app}^{++}=23-24$ to $z_{app}^{++}=25.5$. We find that the fraction of quiescent galaxies increases with local density and with the time spent in groups. A morphological dichotomy is also found between bulge-dominated quiescent and disk-dominated star-forming galaxies. As environment gets denser, the peak of the stellar mass distribution shifts towards $M_*&gt;10^{10}~M_\odot$, and the fraction of galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^9~M_\odot$ decreases significantly, even for star-forming galaxies. We also highlight peculiar features such as close groups, extended nebulae, and a gravitational arc. Our results suggest that galaxies are preprocessed in groups of increasing mass before entering rich groups and clusters. We publicly release two catalogs containing the properties of galaxies and groups, respectively.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission at $z=7-13$: Clear Ly$\alpha$ Equivalent Width Evolution Indicating the Late Cosmic Reionization History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the evolution of Ly$\alpha$ emission derived from 53 galaxies at $z=6.6-13.2$ that are identified by multiple JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy programs of ERS, GO, DDT, and GTO. These galaxies fall on the star-formation main sequence and are the typical star-forming galaxies with UV magnitudes of $-22.5\leq M_\mathrm{UV}\leq-17.0$. We find that 15 out of 53 galaxies show Ly$\alpha$ emission at the $&gt;3\sigma$ levels, and obtain Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) measurements and stringent $3\sigma$ upper limits for the 15 and 38 galaxies, respectively. Confirming that Ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets and line widths of our galaxies are comparable with those of low-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters, we investigate the redshift evolution of the Ly$\alpha$ EW. We find that Ly$\alpha$ EWs statistically decrease towards high redshifts on the Ly$\alpha$ EW vs. $M_{\rm UV}$ plane for various probability distributions of the uncertainties. We then evaluate neutral hydrogen fractions $x_{\rm HI}$ with the Ly$\alpha$ EW redshift evolution and the cosmic reionization simulation results on the basis of a Bayesian inference framework, and obtain $x_{\rm HI}&lt;0.79$, $=0.62^{+0.15}_{-0.36}$, and $0.93^{+0.04}_{-0.07}$ at $z\sim7$, $8$, and $9-13$, respectively. These moderately large $x_{\rm HI}$ values are consistent with the Planck CMB optical depth measurement and previous $x_{\rm HI}$ constraints from galaxy and QSO Ly$\alpha$ damping wing absorptions, and strongly indicate a late reionization history. Such a late reionization history suggests that major sources of reionization would emerge late and be hosted by moderately massive halos in contrast with the widely-accepted picture of abundant low-mass objects for the sources of reionization.</description>

      <title>The history and mass content of cluster galaxies in the EAGLE simulation</title>

Abstract: We explore the mass content of galaxies residing in galaxy clusters at z=0 in the EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation as well as the galaxies' mass build-up through cosmic time. We use a galaxy catalogue generated with the HBT+ algorithm, which identifies subhaloes consistently over time by tracking their dynamical evolution throughout the simulation. The satellite subhalo-to-stellar mass relation (SHSMR) is well described by a double power-law. At stellar masses $9&lt;\log m_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot&lt;10$, satellites have 20-25% the subhalo mass of central galaxies at fixed stellar mass. At high stellar masses the satellite SHSMR is consistent with that of centrals. The satellite SHSMR decreases steeply for satellites closer to the cluster centre, even in projection, broadly consistent with recent weak lensing measurements. The scatter in the satellite SHSMR is larger than that of central galaxies at all cluster masses and cluster-centric distances $R&lt;R_\mathrm{200m}$. The SHSMR scatter decreases with stellar mass by about 12% over an order of magnitude, but this dependence can be explained by the mixing of infall times. There is significant dark matter preprocessing; the most recent infallers into massive clusters had already lost up to 50% of their dark matter by the time of infall, particularly if they fell in indirectly as satellites of another host. On the contrary, on average satellite galaxies are still gaining stellar mass at the time of infall and they do so for another 2 Gyr afterwards, although we see evidence of a slowing growth for indirect infallers. Overall, pre- and post-processing each have similar impacts on the satellite SHSMR. Finally, we provide a simple prescription to infer the mean mass loss experienced by satellites as a function of cluster-centric distance based on a comparison to central galaxies, convenient for observational weak lensing measurements.

      <description>arXiv:2305.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations have become one of the key tools used by theorists in all the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. The development of modern tools that target the largest existing computing systems and exploit state-of-the-art numerical methods and algorithms is thus crucial. In this paper, we introduce the fully open-source highly-parallel, versatile, and modular coupled hydrodynamics, gravity, cosmology, and galaxy-formation code SWIFT. The software package exploits hybrid shared- and distributed-memory task-based parallelism, asynchronous communications, and domain-decomposition algorithms based on balancing the workload, rather than the data, to efficiently exploit modern high-performance computing cluster architectures. Gravity is solved for using a fast-multipole-method, optionally coupled to a particle mesh solver in Fourier space to handle periodic volumes. For gas evolution, multiple modern flavours of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are implemented. SWIFT also evolves neutrinos using a state-of-the-art particle-based method. Two complementary networks of sub-grid models for galaxy formation as well as extensions to simulate planetary physics are also released as part of the code. An extensive set of output options, including snapshots, light-cones, power spectra, and a coupling to structure finders are also included. We describe the overall code architecture, summarise the consistency and accuracy tests that were performed, and demonstrate the excellent weak-scaling performance of the code using a representative cosmological hydrodynamical problem with $\approx$$300$ billion particles. The code is released to the community alongside extensive documentation for both users and developers, a large selection of example test problems, and a suite of tools to aid in the analysis of large simulations run with SWIFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fluid forces associated with primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generate small-scale fluctuations in the primordial density field, which add to the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ linear matter power spectrum on small scales. These enhanced small-scale fluctuations lead to earlier formation of galactic halos and stars and thus affect cosmic reionization. We study the consequences of these effects on 21 cm observables using the semi-numerical code 21cmFAST v3.1.3. We find the excess small-scale structure generates strong stellar radiation backgrounds in the early Universe, resulting in altered 21 cm global signals and power spectra commensurate with earlier reionization. We restrict the allowed PMF models using the CMB optical depth to reionization. Lastly, we probe parameter degeneracies and forecast experimental sensitivities with an information matrix analysis subject to the CMB optical depth bound. Our forecasts show that interferometers like HERA are sensitive to PMFs of order $\sim \mathrm{pG}$, nearly an order of magnitude stronger than existing and next-generation experiments.</description>

Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys are producing datasets of unprecedented size and richness, increasing the potential for high-impact scientific discovery. This possibility, coupled with the challenge of exploring a large number of sources, has led to the development of novel machine-learning-based anomaly detection approaches, such as Astronomaly. For the first time, we test the scalability of Astronomaly by applying it to almost 4 million images of galaxies from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. We use a trained deep learning algorithm to learn useful representations of the images and pass these to the anomaly detection algorithm isolation forest, coupled with Astronomaly's active learning method, to discover interesting sources. We find that data selection criteria have a significant impact on the trade-off between finding rare sources such as strong lenses and introducing artefacts into the dataset. We demonstrate that active learning is required to identify the most interesting sources and reduce artefacts, while anomaly detection methods alone are insufficient. Using Astronomaly, we find 1635 anomalies among the top 2000 sources in the dataset after applying active learning, including eight strong gravitational lens candidates, 1609 galaxy merger candidates, and 18 previously unidentified sources exhibiting highly unusual morphology. Our results show that by leveraging the human-machine interface, Astronomaly is able to rapidly identify sources of scientific interest even in large datasets.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) are driven by scale-free gravitational collapse, but they also reflect the rich astrophysical processes at play in galaxy clusters. At low masses ($\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) and high redshift ($z \gtrsim 1$), these properties remain poorly constrained observationally, due to the difficulty in obtaining resolved and sensitive data. This paper aims at investigating the inner structure of the ICM as seen through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in this regime of mass and redshift. Focus is set on the thermal pressure profile and the scaling relation between SZ flux and mass, namely the $Y_{\rm SZ} - M$ scaling relation. The three galaxy clusters XLSSC~072 ($z=1.002$), XLSSC~100 ($z=0.915$), and XLSSC~102 ($z=0.969$), with $M_{500} \sim 2 \times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, were selected from the XXL X-ray survey and observed with the NIKA2 millimeter camera to image their SZ signal. XMM-Newton X-ray data were used in complement to the NIKA2 data to derive masses based on the $Y_X - M$ relation and the hydrostatic equilibrium. The SZ images of the three clusters, along with the X-ray and optical data, indicate dynamical activity related to merging events. The pressure profile is consistent with that expected for morphologically disturbed systems, with a relatively flat core and a shallow outer slope. Despite significant disturbances in the ICM, the three high-redshift low-mass clusters follow remarkably well the $Y_{\rm SZ}-M$ relation expected from standard evolution. These results indicate that the dominant physics that drives cluster evolution is already in place by $z \sim 1$, at least for systems with masses above $M_{500} \sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Sky location of Galactic white dwarf binaries in space-based gravitational wave detection</title>

Abstract: Quickly localizing the identified white dwarf (WD) binaries is the basic requirement for the space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection. In fact, the amplitude of GW signals are modulated by the periodic motion of GW detectors on the solar orbit. The intensity of the observed signals is enhanced according to the observation time beyond a year to enhance a high signal to noise ratio (SNR). As data gap exists, the completeness of the data observed for a long time depends on filling gaps in the data. Actually, in a year period, the GW sources have a best observation orbit position of GW detectors, where the detector response intensity of GW is maximum. Thus, the best positions, where the direction of GW source is perpendicular to the detection arms, can be searched for the verified GW sources of the sky map to enhance SNR too. For the three arms response intensity of the GW signals changing more clearly with the location of the GW sources relative to the detector, the noises and the suppression of noise by time delay interferometer are ignored. In the four chosen sources, the two verification WD binaries: J0806 and V407 Vul are observed at the best orbit positions by TAIJI for the short time of 2 and 3 days respectively. The intensities of those GWs are above the values of the TAIJI sensitivity curve, significantly. Compared with a single detector, the network of two detectors does not significantly improve the accuracy of location of the verification binaries. These results imply that the searching of GW signals and parameter estimation of GW sources from the experimental data of the space-based mission do not ignore the orbit positions relevant to GW sources.</description>
