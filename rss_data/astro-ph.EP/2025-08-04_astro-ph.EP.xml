      <title>Towards the Habitable Worlds Observatory: 1D CNN Retrieval of Reflection Spectra from Evolving Earth Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming direct-imaging missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) aim to characterize dozens of Earth-like exoplanets by capturing their reflected-light spectra. However, traditional atmospheric retrieval frameworks are too computationally intensive to explore the high-dimensional parameter spaces such missions will generate. Here, we present a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), trained on over one million synthetic, noise-injected spectra simulating Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern Earth analogs, as observed by LUVOIR-B (0.2-2.0 $\mu$m) and HabEx/SS (0.2-1.8 $\mu$m). Our model simultaneously infers six molecular abundances (including biosignatures O$_2$ and O$_3$) along with radius, gravity, surface pressure, and temperature. Inference on unseen test data is performed via Monte Carlo Dropout, enabling uncertainty estimation across thousands of realizations within seconds. The network performs best where spectral features are prominent, accurately recovering CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in Archean atmospheres and O$_2$ and O$_3$ in Modern cases, while avoiding false positives and outputting near-zero abundances in scenarios of true absence such as Archean O$_2$ and O$_3$. Interpretation via Integrated Gradients confirms that the model bases its predictions on physically meaningful features, including the Fraunhofer A band for O$_2$, and the Hartley-Huggins band for O$_3$. Credibility curve analysis indicates that O$_3$ remains retrievable across a wide range of stellar types and distances, while O$_2$ is detectable out to 12 pc around FG stars. These results elevate the CNN from proof of concept to a mission-ready retrieval engine, capable of processing direct-imaging spectra with HWO on an operational cadence.</description>

      <title>Reliability of 1D radiative-convective photochemical-equilibrium retrievals on transit spectra of WASP-107b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of WASP-107b suggest a metal-rich and carbon-deprived atmosphere with an extremely hot interior based on detections of SO$_2$, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, and CH$_4$. In this paper, we aim to determine the reliability of a 1D radiative-convective photochemical-equilibrium (1D-RCPE) retrieval method in inferring atmospheric properties of WASP-107b. Our grid of radiative-convective balanced pressure-temperature profiles and 1D photochemical equilibrated models covers a range of metallicities (Z), carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O), intrinsic temperatures (T$_{int}$), and eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{zz}$). We obtain good fits with our 1D-RCPE retrievals based on a few molecular features of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, SO$_2$, and CH$_4$, but find no substantial contribution of NH$_3$. We find that the degeneracy between metallicity, cloud pressure, and a model offset is broken by the presence of strong SO$_2$ features, confirming that SO$_2$ is a robust metallicity indicator. We systematically retrieve sub-solar C/O based on the relative amplitude of a strong CO$_2$ feature with respect to the broad band of H$_2$O, which is sensitive to a wavelength-dependent scattering slope. We find that high-altitude clouds obscure the CH$_4$-rich layers, preventing the retrievals from constraining T$_{int}$, but that higher values of K$_{zz}$ can transport material above the cloud deck, allowing a fit of the CH$_4$ feature. However, T$_{int}$ and K$_{zz}$ can vary substantially between retrievals depending on the adopted cloud parametrization. We conclude that the 1D-RCPE retrieval method can provide useful insights if the underlying grid of forward models is well understood. We find that WASP-107b's atmosphere is enriched in metals (3 to 5 times solar) and carbon-deprived (C/O &lt;= 0.20). However, we lack robust constraints on the intrinsic temperature and vertical mixing strength.</description>

      <title>Formation of Planetesimals in the Outer Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar System hosts the most studied and best understood major and minor planetary bodies - and the only extraterrestrial bodies to have been visited by spacecraft. The Solar System therefore provides important constraints on both the initial stages of planetary growth, communicated to us by its surviving planetesimal populations, and for the final result of the planet formation process represented by the architecture of the system and properties of the individual planets. We review here models of planetesimal formation in the outer Solar System as well as the wealth of recent observational constraints that has been used to formulate and refine modern planetesimal formation theory.</description>

      <title>Predictions of dust continuum observations of circumplanetary disks with ngVLA: A case study of PDS 70 c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gas giant forms a small gas disk called a "circumplanetary disk (CPD)" around the planet during its gas accretion process. The small gas disk contains dust particles like those in a protoplanetary disk, and these particles could be the building material of large moons. A young T Tauri star PDS 70 has two gas accreting planets, and continuum emission from one of the forming planets, PDS 70 c, has been detected by ALMA Bands 6 and 7, which is considered as the dust thermal emission from its CPD. We reproduce the emission with both bands and predict how the dust emission will be observed by ngVLA by expanding the range of the wavelength from submillimeter to centimeter. We find that the flux density of the dust thermal emission can be detected with ngVLA at Band 6 (3 mm) and probably with Band 5 (7 mm) as well. We also find that the size and shape of the CPD can be constrained by observations of ngVLA Band 6 with reasonable observation time.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 63 New Young Asteroid Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We searched for young asteroid families -- those with ages t_age &lt; 10 Myr and at least three members -- using the proper element catalog from Nesvorny et al. (2024). Our approach employed the Hierarchical Clustering Method (HCM) in a five-dimensional space of proper orbital elements: semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, proper nodal longitude, and proper perihelion longitude. The proper longitudes were calculated for various times in the past. Any convergence of these angles at times t &lt; 10 Myr ago was automatically identified by our algorithm as a clustering event in 5D space at time t. Using this method, we successfully recovered all previously known young families (over 40) and discovered 63 additional ones. The formation ages of these families were determined through backward orbital integrations. To validate orbital convergence, we applied three different methods and obtained generally consistent results. Notably, the vast majority of identified young families have the formation ages t_age &lt; 1 Myr. The number and properties of these families provide valuable constraints on the frequency of recent large cratering or catastrophic collisions, offering new insights into the ongoing collisional evolution of the main asteroid belt. Alternatively, at least some of the families identified here could have been produced by the spin-up and rotational fission of their parent bodies. Future studies should address the relative importance of collisions
  and rotational fission for young asteroid families identified here.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Thermal Conductivity of Earth's Iron-enriched Basal Magma Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth's earliest magnetic field may have originated in a basal magma ocean, a layer of silicate melt surround the core that could have persisted for billions of years. Recent studies show that the electrical conductivity of liquid with a bulk silicate Earth composition exceeds 10000 S/m at basal magma ocean conditions, potentially surprising the threshold for dynamo activity. Over most of its history however, the basal magma ocean is more enriched in iron than the bulk silicate Earth, due to iron's incompatibility in the mineral assemblages of the lower mantle. Using ab-initio molecular dynamics calculations, we examine how iron content affects the silicate dynamo hypothesis. We investigate how the electrical conductivity of silicate liquid changes with iron enrichment, at pressures and temperatures relevant for Earth's basal magma ocean. We also compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity , to evaluate convective instability of basal magma oceans. Finally, we apply our results to model the thermal and magnetic evolution of Earth's basal magma ocean over time.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of the Third Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spin, Color, Spectra and Dust Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to characterize the physical and activity properties of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS through spectroscopic and photometric observations during the first month after its discovery. We performed time-series photometry and long-slit spectroscopy between 2 and 29 July 2025 using multiple ground-based telescopes. Photometric data were calibrated against field stars from the ATLAS and APASS catalogs, and Fourier analysis was applied to derive the comet's rotational period. Spectral data were obtained using the SALT telescope and Nordic Optical Telescope. We report a spin period of $16.16 \pm 0.01$ h with a lightcurve amplitude of approximately 0.3 mag. The comet exhibits increasing dust activity and reddening colors during the observation period, with no visible tail detected, likely due to viewing geometry and low dust production. Dust mass loss rates are estimated between 0.3 and 4.2 kg s^-1, consistent with weakly active distant comets. Spectral colors are similar to those of outer Solar System comets and differ from previously reported values for 3I/ATLAS. The morphological and photometric properties of 3I/ATLAS are consistent with a weakly active comet of outer Solar System origin, despite its interstellar provenance. Continued monitoring around perihelion is necessary to track changes in activity, color, which will provide insights into the evolution of interstellar materials under solar radiation.</description>

      <title>Dark wounds on icy moons: Ganymede's subsurface ocean as a dark matter detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter in the form of macroscopic composites is largely unconstrained at masses of $\sim 10^{11}- 10^{17}$ g. In this mass range, dark matter may collide with planetary bodies, depositing an immense amount of energy and leaving dramatic surface features that remain detectable on geological timescales. In this paper, we show that Ganymede, the largest Jovian moon, provides a prime target to search for dark matter impacts due to its differentiated composition and Gyr-old surface. We study the effects of dark matter collisions with Ganymede first with analytic estimates, finding that in a large region of parameter space, dark matter punches through Ganymede's conductive ice sheet, liberating sub-surface material. This sub-surface material may be compositionally different from the surface ice, providing a key observable with which to discriminate asteroid impacts from those caused by dark matter. We confirm our analytic estimates with dedicated simulations of dark matter impacts using iSALE, a multi-material impact code. We then discuss potential detection prospects with two missions currently en route to the Jovian system, Europa Clipper and JUICE, finding that these missions may have the ability not only to identify signs of life on the Galilean moons, but signs of dark matter as well.</description>

      <title>Instrumental Polarization in Stellar Coronagraphy: Coherent Behavior and its Implications for Dark Hole Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar coronagraphs designed for high-contrast imaging of exoplanets inevitably introduce a small amount of instrumental polarization, called \emph{secondary polarization}. At the contrast levels required to detect and characterize terrestrial planets, these effects may become significant. Instrumentally induced polarization is often referred to as ``incoherent," yet this use of the term lacks rigor. This work uses Jones calculus and vector field simulations, including interactions with dielectric surfaces to show that the secondary polarization is fully coherent with the input field, but it does not interfere with it due to orthogonality. A key consequence of the coherence secondary polarization is that the process of creating a dark hole in the primary polarization tends to also significantly mitigate the intensity corresponding to the secondary polarization, called the \emph{secondary intensity}, in the dark hole region. This reduction of the secondary intensity may lead to relaxed polarization design requirements in future coronagraphs. Additionally, if the contrast is sufficient to make the secondary intensity non-negligible, modulation schemes to separate the planet from the instrumental light need to account for the modulation of the secondary intensity.</description>

      <title>The Subaru-Asahi StarCam: Description of the system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Subaru-Asahi StarCam is a high-sensitivity live-streaming camera for meteor observation, installed on the dome of the Subaru Telescope at the summit area of Maunakea, Hawai'i. Although it was originally intended to share the Maunakea night sky with the public, including the local Hawai'i community, the system quickly demonstrated its potential for scientific research, owing to its highly sensitive video capabilities and the exceptional fraction of clear nights at the site. The core of the StarCam system features a Sony FX3 camera body paired with an F1.4 wide-angle lens, offering a field of view of 70 deg by 40 deg. Leveraging a state-of-the-art, high-sensitivity CMOS sensor and a bright lens, the system is capable of capturing stars as faint as magnitude 8 in real-time, with an effective frame rate of 15--30 fps. Live streaming via YouTube began in April 2021, and the feed is constantly monitored by more than a hundred viewers at any given nighttime. This has enabled the camera to be used not only for observing regular meteor showers but also for monitoring scientifically important phenomena such as fireballs or unexpected meteor outbursts. Notable scientific achievements include: 1) Detection of the new Arid meteor shower in 2021, 2) Identification of a sub-peak activity in the Gamma-Perseid meteor shower (2021), 3) Detection of the 2022 Tau-Herculid meteor shower outburst, 4) Confirmation of the activity of the Andromedid meteor shower (2021), and 5) Multiple detections of meteor cluster phenomena. We discuss the potential and the future scope of StarCam as an open-access, real-time data platform for citizen science in meteor observations.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades in rotating and stratified turbulence in anisotropic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of inverse energy cascades has played a central role in the development of turbulence theory, with applications in two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional flows. We examine the presence or absence of inverse energy cascades in rotating stably stratified flows constrained to anisotropic yet fully three-dimensional domains, in a range of parameters that are relevant for planetary atmospheres. In particular, we focus on regimes with aspect ratios, Rossby, and Froude numbers similar to those found in the Earth's and other planets atmospheres. Our results show that, under certain conditions, inverse energy cascades can indeed emerge from the dry fluid dynamics solely, suggesting that this process can play a role in intermediate-scale atmospheric self-organization processes.</description>

      <title>Detailed Architecture of the L 98-59 System and Confirmation of a Fifth Planet in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The L 98-59 system, identified by TESS in 2019, features three transiting exoplanets in compact orbits of 2.253, 3.691, and 7.451 days around an M3V star, with an outer 12.83-day non-transiting planet confirmed in 2021 using ESPRESSO. The planets exhibit a diverse range of sizes (0.8-1.6 R$_{\oplus}$), masses (0.5-3 M$_{\oplus}$), and likely compositions (Earth-like to possibly water-rich), prompting atmospheric characterization studies with HST and JWST. Here, we analyze 16 new TESS sectors and improve radial velocity (RV) precision of archival ESPRESSO and HARPS data using a line-by-line framework, enabling stellar activity detrending via a novel differential temperature indicator. We refine the radii of L 98-59 b, c, and d to 0.837 $\pm$ 0.019 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.329 $\pm$ 0.029 R$_{\oplus}$, 1.627 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_{\oplus}$, respectively. Combining RVs with transit timing variations (TTV) of L 98-59 c and d from TESS and JWST provides unprecedented constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We report updated masses of 0.46 $\pm$ 0.11 M$_{\oplus}$ for b, 2.00 $\pm$ 0.13 M$_{\oplus}$ for c, and 1.64 $\pm$ 0.07 M$_{\oplus}$ for d, and a minimum mass of 2.82 $\pm$ 0.19 M$_{\oplus}$ for e. We additionally confirm L 98-59\,f, a non-transiting super-Earth with a minimal mass of 2.80 $\pm$ 0.30 M$_{\oplus}$ on a 23.06-day orbit inside the Habitable Zone. The TTVs of L 98-59 c and d (&lt;3 min, $P_{\rm TTV} = 396$ days) constrain the eccentricities of all planets to near-circular orbits ($e \lesssim 0.04$). An internal structure analysis of the transiting planets reveals increasing water-mass fractions ($f_{\rm H_{2}O}$) with orbital distance, reaching $f_{\rm H_{2}O} \approx 0.16$ for L 98-59\ d. We predict eccentricity-induced tidal heating in L 98-59 b with heat fluxes comparable to those of Io, potentially driving volcanic activity.</description>

      <title>Starkiller: subtracting stars and other sources from IFU spectroscopic data through forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present starkiller, an open-source Python package for forward-modeling flux retrieval from integral field unit spectrograph (IFU) datacubes. Starkiller simultaneously provides stellar spectral classification, relative velocity, and line-of-sight extinction for all sources in a catalog, alongside a source-subtracted datacube. It performs synthetic difference imaging by simulating all catalog sources in the field of view, using the catalog for positions and fluxes to scale stellar models, independent of the datacube. This differencing method is particularly powerful for subtracting both point-sources and trailed or even streaked sources from extended astronomical objects. We demonstrate starkiller's effectiveness in improving observations of extended sources in dense stellar fields for VLT/MUSE observations of comets, asteroids and nebulae. We also show that starkiller can treat satellite-impacted VLT/MUSE observations. The package could be applied to tasks as varied as dust extinction in clusters and stellar variability; the stellar modeling using Gaia fluxes is provided as a standalone function. The techniques can be expanded to imagers and to other IFUs.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called ``projective decomposition''. The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred canonical coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse square and inverse cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. From these solutions, a new set of orbit elements for Kepler-Coulomb dynamics is derived, along with their variational equations for arbitrary perturbations (singularity-free in all cases besides rectilinear motion). Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the $J_2$ gravitational perturbation.</description>
