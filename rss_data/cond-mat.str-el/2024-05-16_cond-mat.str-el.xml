      <title>Non-Abelian Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in Flat Moir\'e Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breakthrough experiments have recently realized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in moir\'e materials. However, all states observed are Abelian, the possible existence of more exotic non-Abelian FCIs remains controversial both experimentally and theoretically. Here, we investigate the competition between charge density wave order, gapless composite fermion liquids and non-Abelian Moore-Read states at half-filling of a moir\'e band. Although groundstate (quasi-)degeneracies and spectral flow is not sufficient for distinguishing between charge order and Moore-Read states, we find evidence using entanglement spectroscopy that both these states of matter can be realized with realistic Coulomb interactions. In a double twisted bilayer graphene model transitions between these phases by tuning the coupling strength between the layers: at weak coupling there is a composite Fermi liquid phase and at strong coupling a low entanglement state signaling CDW order emerges. Remarkably, however, there is compelling evidence for a non-Abelian Moore-Read FCI phase at intermediate coupling.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical spin dynamics across temperature scales in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of semi-classical Landau-Lifshitz dynamics (LLD), we conduct a systematic investigation of the temperature-dependent spin dynamics in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg square-lattice antiferromagnet (SqAF). By performing inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn2VO(PO4)2 (ZVPO) and corresponding finite-temperature spin dynamics simulations based on LLD, we present a comprehensive analysis that bridges quantum and classical spin dynamics over a broad temperature range. First, a remarkable agreement between experimental data and LLD simulations is found in the paramagnetic phase of ZVPO, demonstrating the capability of LLD in accurately determining the spin Hamiltonian of S = 1/2 systems and capturing the quantum-to-classical crossover of their spin dynamics. Second, by analyzing the discrepancies between the experimental data and the LLD simulations at lower temperatures, we determine the experimental temperature dependence of the quantum effects in the excitation spectrum of the S = 1/2 SqAF: the quantum renormalization factor for the magnon energies and the quantum continuum above the one-magnon bands. Notably, the emergence of each quantum effect is found to correlate with the formation of three-dimensional long-range order. This work demonstrates the utility of LLD in gaining experimental insights into the temperature-induced modifications of quantum spin dynamics and their convergence towards classical expectations at higher temperatures. This motivates further applications to more challenging quantum antiferromagnets dominated by stronger quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement parity effects in the Kane-Fisher problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement of a segment of length $\ell$ in an XXZ chain with one free extremity and the other connected to the rest of the system with a weak bond. We find that the von-Neumann entropy exhibits terms of order $O(1)$ with strong parity effects, that probe the physics associated with the weakened bond and its behavior under the RG (Kane Fisher problem). In contrast with the XX case studied previously the entropy difference $\delta S\equiv S^e-S^o$ gives rise now to a "resonance" curve which depends on the product $\ell T_B$, with $1/T_B$ a characteristic length scale akin to the Kondo length in Kondo problems. The problem is studied both numerically using DMRG and analytically near the healed and split fixed points. Interestingly - and in contrast with what happens in other impurity problems- $\delta S$ can, at least at lowest order, be tackled by conformal perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Resonance-Induced Anomalies in Temperature-Dependent Raman Scattering of PdSe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive Raman study of the phonon behaviour in PdSe$_2$ in the temperature range of 5 K to 300 K. A remarkable change in the Raman spectrum is observed at 120 K: a significant enhancement of the out-of-plane phonon A$^{1}_{g}$ mode, accompanied by a suppression of the in-plane A$^{2}_{g}$ and B$^{2}_{1g}$ modes. This intriguing behavior is attributed to a temperature-dependent resonant excitation effect. The results are supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which demonstrate that the electron-phonon coupling for the phonon modes varies and is strongly associated with the relevant electronic states. Furthermore, nonlinear frequency shifts are identified in all modes, indicating the decay of an optical phonon into multiple acoustic phonons. The study of Raman emission reported here, complemented by linear optical spectroscopy, reveals an unexpected scenario for the vibrational properties of PdSe$_2$ that holds substantial promise for future applications in PdSe$_2$-based optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Density Matrix Renormalization Group with Clifford Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) or Matrix Product States (MPS) are widely acknowledged as highly effective and accurate methods for solving one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. However, the direct application of DMRG to the study two-dimensional systems encounters challenges due to the limited entanglement encoded in the wave-function ansatz. Conversely, Clifford circuits offer a promising avenue for simulating states with substantial entanglement, albeit confined to stabilizer states. In this work, we present the seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, leveraging the advantages of both Clifford circuits and DMRG. This integration leads to a significant enhancement in simulation accuracy with small additional computational cost. Moreover, this framework is useful not only for its current application but also for its potential to be easily adapted to various other numerical approaches</description>

      <title>1/3 and other magnetization plateaus in a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet $\mathbf{TbTi_3Bi_4}$ with zigzag spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of newly synthesized, single crystals of $\mathrm{TbTi_3Bi_4}$ whose crystal structure is highlighted by the stacking of terbium-based zigzag chains and titanium-based kagome lattices. This compound demonstrates extreme easy-axis magnetic anisotropy due to the crystalline-electric-field effect which aligns the $\mathrm{Tb^{3+}}$ moments along the zigzag chain direction. As the result of the strong single-ion anisotropy and multiple magnetic interactions, $\mathrm{TbTi_3Bi_4}$ behaves as a quasi-one-dimensional Ising magnet with a remarkable antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N}$ = 20.4 K. When a magnetic field is applied along the direction of the zigzag chain, multiple meta-magnetic transitions occur between 1/3 and other magnetization plateaus. We have created a field-temperature phase diagram and mapped out the complex magnetic structures resulting from frustration.</description>

      <title>Highly Tunable Ru-dimer Molecular Orbital State in 6H-perovskite Ba$_3$MRu$_2$O$_9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular orbital (MO) systems with clusters of heavy transition metal (TM) ions are one of the most important classes of model materials for studying the interplay between local physics and effects of itinerancy. Despite a large number of candidates identified in the family of 4d TM materials, an understanding of their physics from competing \textit{microscopic} energy scales is still missing. We bridge this gap by reporting the first resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurement on a well-known series of Ru dimer systems with a 6H-perovskite structure, Ba$_3$MRu$_2$O$_9$ (M$^{3+}$=In$^{3+}$, Y$^{3+}$, La$^{3+}$). Our RIXS measurements reveal an extremely fragile MO state in these Ru dimer compounds, evidenced by an abrupt change in the RIXS spectrum accompanying a tiny change in the local structure tuned by the M-site ion. By modelling the RIXS spectra, we attribute the enhanced electronic instability in Ba$_3$MRu$_2$O$_9$ to the combined effect of a large hopping and a small spin-orbit coupling in the Ru dimers. The unique combination of energy scales uncovered in the present study make Ru MO systems ideal model systems for studying quantum phase transitions with molecular orbitals.</description>

      <title>Space of non-Fermi liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In metals, low-energy effective theories are characterized by a set of coupling functions. Among them, the angle-dependent Fermi momentum specifies the size and shape of Fermi surface. Since the Fermi momentum grows incessantly under the renormalization group flow, a metallic fixed point is defined only modulo a rescaling of Fermi momentum. In this paper, we discuss the physical consequences of this projective nature of fixed points for non-Fermi liquids with hot Fermi surfaces. The first is the absence of a unique dynamical critical exponent that dictates the relative scaling between energy and momentum. The second is mismatches between the scaling dimensions of couplings and their relevancy. Nonetheless, each projective fixed point is characterized by a few marginal and relevant coupling functions, and the notion of universality survives. We illustrate our findings by charting out the space of projective fixed points and extracting their universal properties for the Ising-nematic quantum critical metal beyond the patch theory. To control the theory, we use the dimensional regularization scheme that tunes the co-dimension of Fermi surface. Near the upper critical dimension, two exactly marginal coupling functions span the space of stable projective fixed points: functions that specify the shape of the Fermi surface and the angle-dependent Fermi velocity. All other coupling functions, including the Landau functions and the universal pairing interaction, are fixed by those two marginal functions. With decreasing dimensions, the forward scattering remains irrelevant while the pairing interaction becomes relevant near two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is expected that the universal superconducting fluctuations lower the symmetry of the non-Fermi liquid realized above the superconducting transition temperatures from the loop U(1) group to a proper subgroup.</description>

      <title>Exotic charge density waves and superconductivity on the Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have identified fascinating electronic orders in kagome materials, including intriguing superconductivity, charge density wave (CDW) and nematicity. In particular, some experimental evidence for AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K,Rb,Cs) and related kagome metals hints at the formation of orbital currents in the charge density wave ordered regime, providing a mechanism for spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking in the absence of local moments. In this work, we comprehensively explore the competitive charge instabilities of the spinless kagome lattice with inter-site Coulomb interactions at the pure-sublattice van Hove filling. From the analysis of the charge susceptibility, we find that, at the nesting vectors, while the onsite charge order is dramatically suppressed, the bond charge orders are substantially enhanced owing to the sublattice texture on the hexagonal Fermi surface. Furthermore, we demonstrate that nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor bonds are characterized by significant intrinsic real and imaginary bond fluctuations, respectively. The 2$\times$2 loop current order is thus favored by the next nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion. Interestingly, increasing interactions further leads to a nematic state with intra-cell sublattice density modulation that breaks the $C_6$ rotational symmetry. We further explore superconducting orders descending from onsite and bond charge fluctuations, and discuss our model's implications on the experimental status quo.</description>

      <title>Real and Reciprocal Space Characterization of the 3-Dimensional Charge Density Wave in Quasi-1-Dimensional CuTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials are susceptible to electronic instabilities such as charge density waves (CDWs), originating from a divergence in the Lindhard electron response function, combined with a finite electron-phonon coupling strength. In this report, we present a detailed characterisation of the CDW in the quasi-one-dimensional material CuTe, including (1) direct visualization of lattice distortion seen with non-contact atomic force microscopy in real space, (2) the out-of-plane momentum dependency of the CDW gap size of the quasi-1-dimensional bands, by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, (3) coherent dynamics of a photoexcited phonon mode seen by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, with frequency and wavevector q_CDW corresponding to the soft phonon modes predicted by theory. Furthermore, we find that the CDW gap closes through a transient band renormalisation. We thus confirm that, despite the quasi-1D characteristics of CuTe, it hosts inherently 3-dimensional CDWs.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Driven Breakdown of Electronic Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-thermal breakdown of a Mott insulator has been a topic of great theoretical and experimental interest with technological relevance. Recent experiments have found a sharp non-equilibrium insulator-to-metal transition that is accompanied by hysteresis, a negative differential conductance and lattice deformations. However, a thorough understanding of the underlying breakdown mechanism is still lacking. Here, we examine a scenario in which the breakdown is induced by chemical pressure in a paradigmatic model of interacting spinless fermions on a chain coupled to metallic reservoirs (leads). For the Markovian regime, at infinite bias, we qualitatively reproduce several established results. Beyond infinite bias, we find a rich phase diagram where the nature of the breakdown depends on the coupling strength as the bias voltage is tuned up, yielding different current-carrying non-equilibrium phases. For weak to intermediate coupling, we find a conducting CDW phase with a bias-dependent ordering wave vector. At large interaction strength, the breakdown connects the system to a charge-separated insulating phase. We find instances of hysteretic behavior, sharp current onset and negative differential conductance. Our results can help to shed light on recent experimental findings that address current-induced Mott breakdown.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the charge density wave phase and a pseudogap under antiferromagnetic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations on the charge density wave (CDW) phase in strongly correlated electron systems exhibiting the pseudogap phenomenon. Our investigation employs a n-pole approximation to consider the repulsive Coulomb interaction $(U)$ and antiferromagnetic correlations. Utilizing a two-dimensional Hubbard model for the Coulomb interaction and a BCS-like model for the CDW order parameter, we observe that an increase in $U$ enhances antiferromagnetic fluctuations, resulting in a flattened re-normalized band around the anti-nodal point $(\pi,0)$. The pseudogap manifests in the band structure and density of states, prompting an exploration across various $U$ and occupation number values. Our findings indicate that antiferromagnetic correlations significantly influence the CDW state, as the Fermi surface is reconstructed within the ordered phase. Furthermore, we find a Lifhsitz transition inside both the CDW phase and the normal state, with the latter preceding the onset of the pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Anderson Impurity Mechanism for a Multi-Level Model in $\delta$-Pu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlations and spin-orbit interactions in plutonium create variations in the bonding behavior of each of its allotropes. In $\delta$-Pu, the 5f electrons lie at the tipping point between itinerant and localized behavior which makes the creation of predictive models very difficult. We perform density functional theory calculations to study the effect of correlated descriptions on the mechanical properties of $\delta$-Pu. We find that 7.5% $E_{xx}$ in the HSE functional yields the experimental lattice parameters, moreover, this functional recovers the experimental elastic constants while other approximations fail. The electronic structure of the hybrid functional yields several signatures of strong correlations including orbital-selective bonding of a single 5f electron and a pseudogap-like feature which work in tandem to improve the description of mechanical properties. We show how the emergence of orbital-selective bonding in the hybrid functional can be understood through an Anderson impurity picture which predicts the augmentation of $\pi$-bonding, the decrease of $\sigma$-bonding, and expands the volume of the cell, enabling the accurate description of the mechanical properties of $\delta$-Pu.</description>

      <title>Phonon Inverse Faraday effect from electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phonon inverse Faraday effect describes the emergence of a DC magnetization due to circularly polarized phonons. In this work we present a microscopic formalism for the phonon inverse Faraday effect. The formalism is based on time-dependent second order perturbation theory and electron phonon coupling. While our final equation is general and material independent, we provide estimates for the effective magnetic field expected for the ferroelectric soft mode in the oxide perovskite SrTiO$_3$. Our estimates are consistent with recent experiments showing a huge magnetization after a coherent excitation of circularly polarized phonons with THz laser light. Hence, the theoretical approach presented here is promising for shedding light into the microscopic mechanism of angular momentum transfer between ionic and electronic angular momentum, which is expected to play a central role in the phononic manipulation of magnetism.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of suppression, revival, and loss of charge order in a laser pumped electron-phonon system</title>

Abstract: An electron-phonon system at commensurate filling often displays charge order (CO) in the ground state. Such a system subject to a laser pulse shows a wide variety of behaviour. A weak pulse sets up low amplitude oscillations in the order parameter, with slow decay to a slightly suppressed value. A strong pulse leads to the destruction of the charge order with the order parameter showing rapid, oscillatory, decay to zero. The regime in between, separating the weak pulse CO sustained state from the strong pulse CO destroyed state, shows complex dynamics characterised by multiple, pulse strength dependent, time scales. It involves an initial rapid decay of the order parameter, followed by a low amplitude quiescent state, and the power-law rise to a steady-state over a timescale $\tau_{cr}$. We provide a complete characterisation of the dynamics in this nonequilibrium problem for varying electron-phonon coupling and pulse strength, examine the possibility of an effective "thermal" description of the long time state, and present results on the multiple insulator-metal transitions that show up.</description>

      <title>Dual Bethe-Salpeter equation for the multi-orbital lattice susceptibility within dynamical mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory describes the impact of strong local correlation effects in many-electron systems. While the single-particle spectral function is directly obtained within the formalism, two-particle susceptibilities can also be obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The solution requires handling infinite matrices in Matsubara frequency space. This is commonly treated using a finite frequency cut-off, resulting in slow linear convergence. A decomposition of the two-particle response in local and non-local contributions enables a reformulation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation inspired by the dual boson formalism. The re-formulation has a drastically improved cubic convergence with respect to the frequency cut-off, facilitating the calculation of susceptibilities in multi-orbital systems considerably. This improved convergence arises from the fact that local contributions can be measured in the impurity solver. The dual Bethe-Salpeter equation uses the fully reducible vertex which is free from vertex divergences. We benchmark the approach on several systems including the spin susceptibility of strontium ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, a strongly correlated Hund's metal with three active orbitals.</description>

Abstract: Using neutrons and x-rays we show the topological kagome antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn for $T&lt;285$~K forms a homogeneous spin and charge ordered state comprising a longitudinally polarized spin density wave (SDW) with wavevector $\textbf{k}_{\beta}=k_\beta {\bf \hat{c}}$, a helical modulated version of the room temperature anti-chiral magnetic order with $\textbf{k}_{\chi}=k_\chi{\bf \hat{c}}$, and charge density waves with wave vectors $2\textbf{k}_\beta, 2\textbf{k}_\chi$, and $\textbf{k}_\beta+\textbf{k}_\chi$. Though $\textbf{k}_{\chi}$ and $\textbf{k}_\beta$ coincide for $200~{\rm K}&lt;T&lt;230$~K, they exhibit distinct continuous $T-$dependencies before locking to commensurate values of $\textbf{k}_{\beta} = \frac{1}{12}\textbf{c}^{*}$ and $\textbf{k}_{\chi} = \frac{5}{48}\textbf{c}^{*}$ at low$-T$. Density functional theory indicates this complex modulated state may be associated with the nesting of Fermi surfaces from correlated flat kagome bands, which host Weyl nodes that are annihilated as it forms.</description>

      <title>Dramatic elastic response at the critical end point in UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first-order transition line in the \textit{H-T} phase diagram of itinerant electron metamagnets terminates at the critical end point-analogous to the critical point on the gas-liquid condensation line in the \textit{p-T} phase diagram. To unravel the impact of critical magnetic fluctuations on the crystal lattice of a metamagnet at the critical end point, we performed an ultrasonic study of the itinerant electron metamagnet UTe$_2$ across varying temperatures and magnetic fields. At temperatures exceeding 9 K, a distinct V-shaped anomaly emerges, precisely centered at the critical field of the metamagnetic transition in the isothermal field dependence of elastic constants. This anomaly arises from lattice instability, triggered by critical magnetic fluctuations via strong magnetoelastic interactions. Remarkably, this effect is maximized precisely at the critical-end-point temperature. Comparative measurements of another itinerant metamagnet, UCoAl, reveal intriguing commonalities. Despite significant differences in the paramagnetic ground state, lattice symmetry, and the expected metamagnetic transition process between UTe$_2$ and UCoAl, both exhibit similar anomalies in elastic properties near the critical end point. These shared aspects may hold universality for other itinerant electron metamagnets.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ashkin-Teller criticality in a constrained boson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, via explicit computation on a constrained bosonic model, that the presence of subsystem symmetries can lead to a quantum phase transition (QPT) where the critical point exhibits an emergent enhanced symmetry. Such a transition separates a unique gapped ground state from a gapless one; the latter phase exhibits a broken $Z_2$ symmetry which we tie to the presence of the subsystem symmetries in the model. The intermediate critical point separating these phases exhibits an additional emergent $Z_2$ symmetry which we identify; this emergence leads to a critical theory in the Ashkin-Teller, instead of the expected Ising, universality class. We show that the transitions of the model reproduces the Askhin-Teller critical line with variable correlation length exponent $\nu$ but constant central charge $c$. We verify this scenario via explicit exact-diagonalization computations, provide an effective Landau-Ginzburg theory for such a transition, and discuss the connection of our model to the PXP model describing Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Detecting Quantum Anomalies in Open Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries and quantum anomalies serve as powerful tools for constraining complicated quantum many-body systems, offering valuable insights into low-energy characteristics based on their ultraviolet structure. Nevertheless, their applicability has traditionally been confined to closed quantum systems, rendering them largely unexplored for open quantum systems described by density matrices. In this work, we introduce a novel and experimentally feasible approach to detect quantum anomalies in open systems. Specifically, we claim that, when coupled with an external environment, the mixed 't Hooft anomaly between spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry gives distinctive characteristics for half-integer and integer spin chains in measurements of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ as a function of $\theta$. Notably, the half-integer spin chain manifests a topological phenomenon akin to the ``level crossing" observed in closed systems. To substantiate our assertion, we develop a lattice-level spacetime rotation to analyze the aforementioned measurements. Based on the matrix product density operator and transfer matrix formalism, we analytically establish and numerically demonstrate the unavoidable singular behavior of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ for half-integer spin chains. Conceptually, our work demonstrates a way to discuss notions like ``spectral flow'' and ``flux threading'' in open systems not necessarily with a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Relocalization of Uranium 5f Electrons in Antiferromagnetic Heavy Fermion Superconductor UPd$_2$Al$_3$: Insights from Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the antiferromagnetic heavy fermion superconductor UPd$_2$Al$_3$, employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to unravel the complex electronic structure of its U 5f electrons. We observe unexpected characteristics that challenge the conventional temperature-dependent behavior of heavy fermion systems, revealing unexpected characteristics. At temperatures above the anticipated coherence temperature (T$^*$), we observe itinerant U 5f electrons at temperatures higher than previously postulated. Additionally, a previously unidentified dispersionless band emerges around 600 meV below the Fermi energy, potentially linked to spin-orbit splitting within the U 5f states. Hybridization between the 5f electrons and conduction band was observed with an energy dispersion of 10 meV at low temperatures, suggesting that U 5f electrons near and at the Fermi surface have an itinerant nature. Temperature-dependent 5d-5f resonance spectra reveal that the 5f electron spectrum weight increases with lowering temperature and begins to decrease at temperatures significantly higher than the Neel temperature (T$_N$). We further show that the competition between the Kondo effect and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions may be responsible for the relocalization of 5f electrons, making relocalization a precursor to the establishment of magnetic order at lower temperatures. Our experiments also provide evidence that 5f electrons with the same orbital are involved in both the Kondo effect and RKKY interactions, suggesting that the two coexist at lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Switching of Magnetization in Quantum Antiferromagnets with Time-Dependent Control Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic states is one of the necessities in modern data storage technology. Quantum antiferromagnets are promising candidates in this respect. The orientation of the order parameter, the sublattice magnetization, can be used to encode "0" and "1" of a bit. Then, the switching of magnetization and the full control of its reorientation are crucial for writing data. We show that the magnetization can be switched efficiently by an external short THz pulses with relatively low amplitude. The coupling to the spin degrees can be direct via the magnetic field or indirect via the electric field inducing spin-polarized charge currents. Our description is based on time-dependent Schwinger boson mean-field theory which includes the intrinsic dephasing mechanisms beyond a macrospin description. The findings help to introduce the use of antiferromagnets in data storage technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical nature of pseudogap phase is one of the most important and intriguing problems towards understanding the key mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates. Theoretically, the square-lattice $t$-$J$ model is widely believed to be the simplest toy model that captures the essential physics of cuprate superconductors. We employ the Grassmann tensor product state approach to investigate uniform states in the underdoped ($\delta \lesssim 0.1$) region. In addition to the previously known uniform $d$-wave state, we discover a strongly fluctuating pair density wave (PDW) state with wave vector $Q = (\pi, \pi)$. This fluctuating PDW state weakly breaks the $C_4$ rotational symmetry of the square lattice and has a lower or comparable energy to the $d$-wave state (depending on doping and the $t/J$ ratio), making it a promising candidate state for describing the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel critical phenomena beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm have been long sought after. Among many candidate scenarios, the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) constitutes the most fascinating one, and its lattice model realization has been debated over the past two decades. Following the pioneering works with the fuzzy sphere methods [W. Zhu, et al, Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009], we apply the spherical Landau level regularization to study the effective (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term and the potential DQCP therein. Utilizing the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group method with explicit $\text{SU(2)}_\text{spin}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{charge}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{angular-momentum}$ symmetry as well as exact diagonalization simulations, we provide a comprehensive phase diagram for the model with a SO(5) continuous transition line -- extension of the previous identified SO(5) multicritical point [arXiv:2307.05307] -- while tuning interaction length. The state-operator correspondence with the conformal tower structure is used to identify the emergent conformal symmetry with the best scaling dimension of relevant primary fields and they match well with the critical exponents obtained from the crossing point analysis of the correlation ratio. Our results thus further support the rich structure of the phase diagram of the SO(5) model.</description>

      <title>Robust non-Abelian even-denominator fractional Chern insulator in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experiment observes a series of quantum Hall effects in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e MoTe$_2$ [K. Kang, et. al, Nature 628, 522-526 (2024)]. Among them, the filling $\nu$ = 3 state points to a time-reversal pair of edge states resembling those of the even-denominator fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Inspired by this discovery, we investigate whether a robust incompressible quantum Hall liquid can be stabilized in the half-filled Chern band of twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We use the continuum model with parameters relevant to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers and obtain three consecutive nearly flat Chern bands that resemble the experimental plateaus at filling $\nu$ = 2, 4, 6. Crucially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found via exact diagonalization calculations, including the stable six-fold ground state degeneracy which grows more robust for larger lattice sizes in consistency with an even-denominator FCI state. We further perform flux insertion simulations to reveal a 1/2 quantized many-body Chern number. Furthermore, the ground state density structure factors show no sharp peak, which excludes the charge density wave order. These evidences signal the potential of realizing the non-Abelian state at zero magnetic field in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers at the fractional hole filling 3/2.</description>

      <title>Dynamics after quenches in one-dimensional quantum Ising-like systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising-like systems, arising from sudden quenches of the Hamiltonian parameter $g$ driving quantum transitions between disordered and ordered phases. In particular, we consider quenches to values of $g$ around the critical value $g_c$, and mainly address the question whether, and how, the quantum transition leaves traces in the evolution of the transverse and longitudinal magnetizations during such a deep out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We shed light on the emergence of singularities in the thermodynamic infinite-size limit, likely related to the integrability of the model. Finite systems in periodic and open boundary conditions develop peculiar power-law finite-size scaling laws related to revival phenomena, but apparently unrelated to the quantum transition, because their main features are generally observed in quenches to generic values of $g$. We also investigate the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, modeled by a Lindblad equation with local decay and pumping dissipation operators within the quadratic fermionic model obtainable by a Jordan-Wigner mapping. Dissipation tends to suppress the main features of the unitary dynamics of closed systems. We finally address the effects of integrability breaking, due to further lattice interactions, such as in anisotropic next-to-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) models. We show that some qualitative features of the post-quench dynamics persist, in particular the different behaviors when quenching to quantum ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, and the revival phenomena due to the finite size of the system.</description>

Abstract: The Bethe ansatz represents an analytical method enabling the exact solution of numerous models in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. When a global symmetry is present, the trial wavefunctions of the Bethe ansatz consist of plane wave superpositions. Previously, it has been shown that the Bethe ansatz can be recast as a deterministic quantum circuit. An analytical derivation of the quantum gates that form the circuit was lacking however. Here we present a comprehensive study of the transformation that brings the Bethe ansatz into a quantum circuit, which leads us to determine the analytical expression of the circuit gates. As a crucial step of the derivation, we present a simple set of diagrammatic rules that define a novel Matrix Product State network building Bethe wavefunctions. Remarkably, this provides a new perspective on the equivalence between the coordinate and algebraic versions of the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

Abstract: We establish a universal relation between the energy gap and the static dielectric constant for all insulating states. This relation yields an upper bound on the energy gap, which only depends on the electron density and electronic dielectric constant. We identify two types of energy gaps associated with transverse and longitudinal excitations at long wavelength, which correspond to the optical gap and the plasmon energy respectively. Their upper bounds are set by the dielectric constant and its inverse respectively. The transverse gap bound is calculated for a wide range of materials and compared with the measured optical gap. A remarkable case is cubic boron nitride, in which the direct gap reaches \SI{72}{\percent} of the bound.
  Our results are derived from the Kramers-Kronig relation and the $f$-sum rule, and therefore rest on general physical principles.</description>

Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>
