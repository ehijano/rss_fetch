      <title>Functionally graded keratin facilitates tactile sensing in elephant whiskers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keratin composites enable animals to hike with hooves, fly with feathers, and sense with skin. These distinct functions arise from variations in the underlying properties and microscale arrangement of this natural polymer. One well-studied example is mammalian whiskers, elongated keratin rods attached to tactile skin structures that extend the animal's sensory volume. Here, we investigate the non-actuated whiskers that cover Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) trunks and find they are geometrically and mechanically tailored to facilitate tactile perception by encoding contact location in vibrotactile signal amplitude and frequency. Elephant whiskers emerge from armored trunk skin and shift from a thick, circular, porous, stiff root to a thin, ovular, dense, soft point. This smooth transition enables interaction with widely varying substrates, reduces wear, and increases the vibrotactile signal information generated during contact. The functionally graded geometry, porosity, and stiffness of elephant whiskers tune the neuromechanics of trunk touch, facilitating highly dexterous manipulation.</description>

      <title>Single-Cell Trajectory Reconstruction Reveals Migration Potential of Cell Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell migration, which is strictly regulated by intracellular and extracellular cues, is crucial for normal physiological processes and the progression of certain diseases. However, there is a lack of an efficient approach to analyze super-statistical and time-varying characteristics of cell migration based on single trajectories. Here, we propose an approach to reconstruct single-cell trajectories, which incorporates wavelet transform, power spectrum of an OU-process, and fits of the power spectrum to analyze statistical and time-varying properties of customized target-finding and migration metrics. Our results reveal diverse relationships between motility parameters and dynamic metrics, especially the existence of an optimal parameter range. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the loss of Arpin protein enhances the migration potential of D. discoideum, and a previously reported result that the rescued amoeba is distinguishable from the wild-type amoeba. Significantly, time-varying dynamic metrics emerge periodic phenomena under the influence of irregularly changing parameters, which correlates with migration potential. Our analysis suggests that the approach provides a powerful tool for estimating time-dependent migration potential and statistical features of single-cell trajectories, enabling a better understanding of the relationship between intracellular proteins and cellular behaviors. This also provides more insights on the migration dynamics of single cells and cell populations.</description>

      <title>Orientational ordering in active nematic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vivo and in vitro systems of cells and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) systems are well known to form ordered patterns of orientationally aligned fibers. Here, we interpret them as active analogs of the (disordered) isotropic to the (ordered) nematic phase transition seen in passive liquid crystalline elastomers. A minimal theoretical framework that couples cellular activity (embodied as mechanical stress) and the finite deformation elasticity of liquid crystal elastomers sets the stage to explain these patterns. Linear stability analysis of the governing equations about simple homogeneous isotropic base states shows how the onset of periodic morphologies depends on the activity, elasticity, and applied strain, provides an expression for the wavelength of the instability, and is qualitatively consistent with observations of cell-ECM experiments. Finite element simulations of the nonlinear problem corroborate the results of linear analysis. These results provide quantitative insights into the onset and evolution of nematic order in cell-matrix composites.</description>

      <title>Feedback controlled microengine powered by motor protein</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a template for realization of a novel microengine which is able to harness and convert the activity driven movement of individual motor protein into work output of the system. This engine comprises of a micron size bead-motor protein complex that is subject to a time-varying, feedback controlled optical potential, and a driving force due to the action of the motor protein which stochastically binds, walks and unbinds to an underlying microtubule filament. Using a Stochastic thermodynamics framework and theoretical modeling of bead-motor transport in a harmonic optical trap potential, we obtain the engine characteristics, e.g., work output per cycle, power generated, efficiency and the probability distribution function of the work output as a function of motor parameters and optical trap stiffness. The proposed engine is a work-to-work converter. Remarkably, the performance of this engine can vastly supersede the performance of other microengines that have been realized so far for feasible biological parameter range for kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor proteins. In particular, the work output per cycle is ~ (10-15) k_b T while the power output is (5-8) k_b T s^{-1}. Furthermore, we find that even with time delay in feedback protocol, the performance of the engine remains robust as long as the delay time is much smaller than the Brownian relaxation time of the micron size bead. Indeed such low delay time in feedback in the optical trap setup can easily be achieved with current Infrared (IR) lasers and optical trap sensor. The average work output and power output of the engine, exhibits interesting non-monotonic dependence on motor velocity and optical trap stiffness. As such this motor protein driven microengine can be a promising potential prototype for fabricating an actual microdevice engine which can have practical utility.</description>

      <title>Simple lipids form stable higher-order structures in concentrated sulfuric acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Venus has become a target of astrobiological interest because it is physically accessible to direct exploration, unlike exoplanets. So far this interest has been motivated not by the explicit expectation of finding life but rather by a desire to understand the limits of biology. The venusian surface is sterilizing, but the cloud deck includes regions with temperatures and pressures conventionally considered compatible with life. However, the venusian clouds are thought to consist of concentrated sulfuric acid. To determine if any fundamental features of life as we understand them here on Earth could in principle exist in these extreme solvent conditions, we tested several simple lipids for resistance to solvolysis and their ability to form structures in concentrated sulfuric acid. We find that single-chain saturated lipids with sulfate, alcohol, trimethylamine, and phosphonate head groups are resistant to sulfuric acid degradation at room temperature. Furthermore, we find that they form stable higher-order structures typically associated with lipid membranes, micelles, and vesicles. Finally, results from molecular dynamics simulations suggest a molecular explanation for the observed robustness of the lipid structures formed in concentrated sulfuric acid. We conclude with implications for the study of Venus as a target of experimental astrobiology.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domains (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model considering the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, we calculated the incidence of each case across a variety of radiation doses and LETs. Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are significantly more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is significantly more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 versus LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects induced by high LET irradiation. Our study underscores the significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for establishing mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different doses and LETs.</description>
