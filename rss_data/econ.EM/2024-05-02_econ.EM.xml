      <title>Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Item-Level Outcome Data: Insights from Item Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyses of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) are common in applied causal inference research. However, when outcomes are latent variables assessed via psychometric instruments such as educational tests, standard methods ignore the potential HTE that may exist among the individual items of the outcome measure. Failing to account for "item-level" HTE (IL-HTE) can lead to both estimated standard errors that are too small and identification challenges in the estimation of treatment-by-covariate interaction effects. We demonstrate how Item Response Theory (IRT) models that estimate a treatment effect for each assessment item can both address these challenges and provide new insights into HTE generally. This study articulates the theoretical rationale for the IL-HTE model and demonstrates its practical value using data from 20 randomized controlled trials in economics, education, and health. Our results show that the IL-HTE model reveals item-level variation masked by average treatment effects, provides more accurate statistical inference, allows for estimates of the generalizability of causal effects, resolves identification problems in the estimation of interaction effects, and provides estimates of standardized treatment effect sizes corrected for attenuation due to measurement error.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bias-Correction and Valid Inference in High-Dimensional Ridge Regression: A Closed-Form Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ridge regression is an indispensable tool in big data econometrics but suffers from bias issues affecting both statistical efficiency and scalability. We introduce an iterative strategy to correct the bias effectively when the dimension $p$ is less than the sample size $n$. For $p&gt;n$, our method optimally reduces the bias to a level unachievable through linear transformations of the response. We employ a Ridge-Screening (RS) method to handle the remaining bias when $p&gt;n$, creating a reduced model suitable for bias-correction. Under certain conditions, the selected model nests the true one, making RS a novel variable selection approach. We establish the asymptotic properties and valid inferences of our de-biased ridge estimators for both $p&lt; n$ and $p&gt;n$, where $p$ and $n$ may grow towards infinity, along with the number of iterations. Our method is validated using simulated and real-world data examples, providing a closed-form solution to bias challenges in ridge regression inferences.</description>

      <title>On Binscatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09608v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binscatter is a popular method for visualizing bivariate relationships and conducting informal specification testing. We study the properties of this method formally and develop enhanced visualization and econometric binscatter tools. These include estimating conditional means with optimal binning and quantifying uncertainty. We also highlight a methodological problem related to covariate adjustment that can yield incorrect conclusions. We revisit two applications using our methodology and find substantially different results relative to those obtained using prior informal binscatter methods. General purpose software in Python, R, and Stata is provided. Our technical work is of independent interest for the nonparametric partition-based estimation literature.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Average Effects in Discrete Choice Panel Data Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In discrete choice panel data, the estimation of average effects is crucial for quantifying the effect of covariates, and for policy evaluation and counterfactual analysis. This task is challenging in short panels with individual-specific effects due to partial identification and the incidental parameter problem. In particular, estimation of the sharp identified set is practically infeasible at realistic sample sizes whenever the number of support points of the observed covariates is large, such as when the covariates are continuous. In this paper, we therefore propose estimating outer bounds on the identified set of average effects. Our bounds are easy to construct, converge at the parametric rate, and are computationally simple to obtain even in moderately large samples, independent of whether the covariates are discrete or continuous. We also provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals on the identified set.</description>

      <title>Identification of Nonlinear Dynamic Panels under Partial Stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies identification for a wide range of nonlinear panel data models, including binary choice, ordered response, and other types of limited dependent variable models. Our approach accommodates dynamic models with any number of lagged dependent variables as well as other types of (potentially contemporary) endogeneity. Our identification strategy relies on a partial stationarity condition, which not only allows for an unknown distribution of errors but also for temporal dependencies in errors. We derive partial identification results under flexible model specifications and provide additional support conditions for point identification. We demonstrate the robust finite-sample performance of our approach using Monte Carlo simulations, and apply the approach to analyze the empirical application of income categories using various ordered choice models.</description>

      <title>Noisy Measurements Are Important, the Design of Census Products Is Much More Important</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: McCartan et al. (2023) call for "making differential privacy work for census data users." This commentary explains why the 2020 Census Noisy Measurement Files (NMFs) are not the best focus for that plea. The August 2021 letter from 62 prominent researchers asking for production of the direct output of the differential privacy system deployed for the 2020 Census signaled the engagement of the scholarly community in the design of decennial census data products. NMFs, the raw statistics produced by the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System before any post-processing, are one component of that design-the query strategy output. The more important component is the query workload output-the statistics released to the public. Optimizing the query workload-the Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File, specifically-could allow the privacy-loss budget to be more effectively managed. There could be fewer noisy measurements, no post-processing bias, and direct estimates of the uncertainty from disclosure avoidance for each published statistic.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Bootstrap: Efficient Simulation of Input Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bootstrap is a popular methodology for simulating input uncertainty. However, it can be computationally expensive when the number of samples is large. We propose a new approach called \textbf{Orthogonal Bootstrap} that reduces the number of required Monte Carlo replications. We decomposes the target being simulated into two parts: the \textit{non-orthogonal part} which has a closed-form result known as Infinitesimal Jackknife and the \textit{orthogonal part} which is easier to be simulated. We theoretically and numerically show that Orthogonal Bootstrap significantly reduces the computational cost of Bootstrap while improving empirical accuracy and maintaining the same width of the constructed interval.</description>
