      <title>AI-Driven Autonomous Control of Proton-Boron Fusion Reactors Using Backpropagation Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-boron (p-11B) fusion presents a promising path towards sustainable, neutron-free energy generation. However, its implementation is hindered by extreme operational conditions, such as plasma temperatures exceeding billions of degrees and the complexity of controlling high-energy particles. Traditional control systems face significant challenges in managing the highly dynamic and non-linear behavior of the plasma. In this paper, we propose a novel approach utilizing backpropagation-based neural networks to autonomously control key parameters in a proton-boron fusion reactor. Our method leverages real-time feedback and learning from physical data to adapt to changing plasma conditions, offering a potential breakthrough in stable and efficient p-11B fusion. Furthermore, we expand on the scalability and generalization of our approach to other fusion systems and future AI technologies.</description>

      <title>X-ray free-electron lasing in a flying-focus undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven free-electron lasers (LDFELs) replace magnetostatic undulators with the electromagnetic fields of a laser pulse. Because the undulator period is half the wavelength of the laser pulse, LDFELs can amplify x rays using lower electron energies and over shorter interaction lengths than a conventional free-electron laser. Here we show that a flying-focus pulse substantially reduces the energy required to reach high gain in an LDFEL by providing a highly uniform, high-intensity field over the entire interaction length. The flying-focus pulse features an intensity peak that travels in the opposite direction of its phase fronts. This enables an LDFEL configuration where an electron beam collides head-on with the phase fronts and experiences a near-constant undulator strength as it co-propagates with the intensity peak. Three-dimensional simulations of this configuration demonstrate the generation of megawatts of coherent x-ray radiation with 20 times less energy than a conventional laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Real-time steerable frequency-stepped Doppler Backscattering (DBS) System for local helicon wave electric field measurements on the DIII-D tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new frequency-stepped Doppler backscattering (DBS) system has been integrated with a real-time steerable electron cyclotron heating launcher to probe local background turbulence (f&lt;10 MHz) and high-frequency (20-550 MHz) density fluctuations in the DIII-D tokamak. The launcher enables 2D steering (horizontal and vertical) over wide angular ranges to optimize probe location and wavenumber response, with vertical steering adjustable in real time during discharges. The DBS system utilizes a programmable frequency synthesizer with adjustable dwell time, capable of stepping across the E-band frequency range (60-90 GHz) in real time, launching either O or X-mode polarized millimeter waves. This setup facilitates diagnosis of the complex spatial structure of high-power (&gt;200 kW) helicon waves (476 MHz) during current drive experiments. Real-time scans reveal broadband density fluctuations around the helicon frequency, attributed to backscattering of the DBS millimeter wave probe from plasma turbulence modulated by the helicon wave. These fluctuations appear as high-frequency sidebands in the turbulence spectrum, effectively 'tagging' the background turbulence with the helicon wave's electric field. This method allows for monitoring local helicon wave amplitude by comparing high-frequency signal amplitude to background turbulence. Coupled with real-time scanning of measurement location and wavenumber, this allows for rapid helicon wave power distribution determination during steady-state plasma operation, potentially validating predictive models like GENRAY or AORSA for helicon current drive in DIII-D plasmas.</description>

      <title>Designing tungsten armoured plasma facing components to pulsed heat loads in magnetic fusion machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible design rule for preventing surface damage from thermal transients to solid tungsten armour is proposed and formulated for the plasma facing components (divertor, first wall) of magnetic fusion machines. The rule is based on combined results from laboratory experiments and operating fusion machines, and fundamental engineering principles such as the heat flux factor (FHF) and fatigue usage fraction (FUF). As an example, the rule would allow 2.10 4 transient heat loads cycles at a FHF of 10 MJm${}^{-2}$s${}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ before the lifetime is considered exhausted. The formulation of the rule using engineering principles allows combining loads of different magnitudes and various number of cycles. A practical example of the rule usage is provided, illustrating loads combination and how the rule may contribute to the component geometrical design. The proposed rule is only valid for surface loading conditions, hence is not usable for volumetric loading conditions such as runaway electrons. Setting a budget lifetime and a design rule does not preclude actual plasma operation beyond the design lifetime. It is actually normal that experimental devices explore a larger domain than the one defined at the time of the design.</description>

      <title>FEQIS: A free-boundary equilibrium solver for integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new axisymmetric equilibrium solver has been written, called FEQIS (Flexible EQuIlibrium Solver), which purpose is to be used inside integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas. The FEQIS code solves the Grad-Shafranov equation and the "circuit" equations for the external coils and passive conducting structures that are toroidally connected. The code has been specifically equipped with flexibility in choice of circuit connections, and a stripped-down numerical scheme for the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation through a structure of multi-level simplifications which can be tested against the required accuracy.</description>

      <title>Designing a Validation Experiment for Radio Frequency Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical studies have suggested that nonlinear effects can lead to "radio frequency condensation", which coalesces RF power deposition and driven current near the center of a magnetic island. It is predicted that an initially broad current profile can coalesce in islands when they reach sufficient width, providing automatic stabilization. Experimental validation of the theory has thus far been lacking. This paper proposes experiments on DIII-D for testing and refining the theory of the nonlinear effects.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>Investigation on upstream ion events from L1 point observation: New Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origin of energetic upstream ions propagating towards the Sun from the Earth's bow shock is not understood clearly. In this letter, relationship between solar wind suprathermal and upstream ions has been investigated by analyzing fluxes of H, 4He, and CNO obtained from multidirectional in-situ measurements at the first Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system during 2012-2014. 49 upstream events have been selected based on flux enhancements of the upstream ions in comparison with the solar wind suprathermal ions. An energy cut-off at less than 300 keV is observed for the upstream events. This is attributed to the efficacy of the particle acceleration process near the bow shock. Interestingly, spectra of upstream ions soften systematically as compared to the spectra of their solar wind counterpart with decreasing mass of elements. The degree of spectral softening increases with decreasing mass-to-charge ratio of the species. Since during most of the events the interplanetary magnetic field was radial, we argue that cross-field diffusion of upstream ions gives rise to the modulation (spectral softening) of upstream ions, which is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of species. Our work indicates towards a systematic change in solar wind suprathermal ions after interaction with the bow shock.</description>

      <title>A new framework for particle-wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In plasma physics, collisionless charged particles are transported following the dynamics of a meanfield Vlasov equation with a self-consistent electric field generated by the charge density. Due to the long range interaction between particles, the generating electric field oscillates and disperses like a Klein-Gordon dispersive wave, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves. The oscillatory electric field in turn drives particles. Despite its great physical importance, the question of whether such a nonlinear particle-wave interaction would remain regular globally and be damped in the large time has been an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework to resolve this exact nonlinear interaction. Specifically, we employ the framework to establish the large time behavior and scattering of solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Klein-Gordon system in the small initial data regime. The novelty of this work is to provide a detailed physical space description of particles moving in an oscillatory field and to resolve oscillations for the electric field generated by the collective interacting particles. This appears to be the first such a result analyzing oscillations in the physical phase space $\mathbb{R}^3_x\times \mathbb{R}_v^3$.</description>

      <title>Observation of astrophysically-relevant superadiabaticity in a plasma confined by a dipole magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polytropic index of electrons in a magnetized plasma is experimentally investigated in the presence of heating and anisotropic work done, incorporating the effective dimensionality arising from temperature anisotropy. The study is performed in a plasma confined by a permanent cylindrical dipole magnet using a compact device. The measurements clearly demonstrate localized regions of superadiabatic electrons due to particle acceleration and energization through non-resonant heating processes. The realization of superadiabaticity is universal where heating dominates the work done and has broader implications for energy exchange processes in space and astrophysically-relevant plasmas.</description>

      <title>Global Stellarator Coil Optimization with Quadratic Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08267v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most present stellarator designs are produced by costly two-stage optimization: the first for an optimized equilibrium, and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. Few proxies for coil complexity and forces exist at the equilibrium stage. Rapid initial state finding for both stages is a topic of active research. Most present convex coil optimization codes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with recent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics objectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of linear functions in coil current. We present QUADCOIL, a fast, global coil optimization method that targets combinations of linear and quadratic functions of the current. It can directly constrain and/or minimize a wide range of physics objectives unavailable in NESCOIL and REGCOIL, including the Lorentz force, magnetic energy, curvature, field-current alignment, and the maximum density of a dipole array. QUADCOIL requires no initial guess and runs nearly $10^2\times$ faster than filament optimization. Integrating it in the equilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with difficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation time per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large parameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing approximate global minimum. It supports most regularization techniques developed for NESCOIL and REGCOIL. We demonstrate QUADCOIL's effectiveness in coil topology control, minimizing non-convex penalties, and predicting filament coil complexity with three numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Including the vacuum energy in stellarator coil design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being three-dimensional, stellarators have the advantage that plasma currents are not essential for creating rotational-transform; however, the external current-carrying coils in stellarators can have strong geometrical shaping, which can complicate the construction.
  Reducing the inter-coil electromagnetic forces acting on strongly shaped 3D coils and the stress on the support structure, while preserving the favorable properties of the magnetic field is a design challenge.
  In this work, we recognize that the inter-coil ${\boldsymbol{j}} \times {\boldsymbol{B}}$ forces are the gradient of the vacuum magnetic energy, $\displaystyle E := \frac{1}{2\mu_0}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \!\!\! B^2 \, dV$.
  We introduce an objective functional, ${\mathcal{F}}:= \Phi_2 + \omega E$, built on the usual quadratic flux on a prescribed target surface, $\displaystyle \Phi_2 := \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathcal{S}} ( {\boldsymbol{B}} \cdot {\boldsymbol{n}} )^2 \, dS$, and the vacuum energy, where $\omega$ is a weight penalty.
  The Euler-Lagrange equation for stationary states is derived, and numerical illustrations are computed using the SIMSOPT code \cite{simsopt}.</description>

      <title>Parametric Survey of Nonaxisymmetric Accretion Disk Instabilities: Magnetorotational Instability to Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accretion disks are highly unstable to magnetic instabilities driven by shear flow, where classically, the axisymmetric, weak-field Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) has received much attention through local WKB approximations. In contrast, discrete non-axisymmetric counterparts require a more involved analysis through a full global approach to deal with the influence of the nearby magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) continua. Recently, rigorous MHD spectroscopy identified a new type of an ultra-localised, non-axisymmetric instability in global disks with super-Alfv\'enic flow. These Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instabilities (SARIs) fill vast unstable regions in the complex eigenfrequency plane with (near-eigen)modes that corotate at the local Doppler velocity and are radially localised between Alfv\'enic resonances. Unlike discrete modes, they are utterly insensitive to the radial disk boundaries. In this work, we independently confirm the existence of these unprecedented modes using our novel spectral MHD code Legolas reproducing and extending our earlier study with detailed eigenspectra and eigenfunctions. We calculate growth rates of SARIs and MRI in a variety of disk equilibria, highlighting the impact of field strength and orientation, and find correspondence with analytical predictions for thin, weakly magnetised disks. We show that non-axisymmetric modes can significantly extend instability regimes at high mode numbers, with maximal growth rates comparable to the MRI. Furthermore, we explicitly show a region filled with quasi-modes whose eigenfunctions are extremely localised in all directions. These modes must be ubiquitous in accretion disks, and play a role in local shearing box simulations. Finally, we revisit recent dispersion relations in the Appendix, highlighting their relation to our global framework.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are prevalent on almost all astronomical scales, but their importance in different systems and over cosmic time is yet to be understood. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. In this study, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ per cent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ per cent across the regions with polarisation detection, similar to that of local starburst galaxies. The polarised dust emission is patchy and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s, and extends over 3 kiloparsecs. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.</description>
