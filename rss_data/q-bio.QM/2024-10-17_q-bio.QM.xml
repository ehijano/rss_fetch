      <title>Incorporating Metabolic Information into LLMs for Anomaly Detection in Clinical Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in clinical time-series holds significant potential in identifying suspicious patterns in different biological parameters. In this paper, we propose a targeted method that incorporates the clinical domain knowledge into LLMs to improve their ability to detect anomalies. We introduce the Metabolism Pathway-driven Prompting (MPP) method, which integrates the information about metabolic pathways to better capture the structural and temporal changes in biological samples. We applied our method for doping detection in sports, focusing on steroid metabolism, and evaluated using real-world data from athletes. The results show that our method improves anomaly detection performance by leveraging metabolic context, providing a more nuanced and accurate prediction of suspicious samples in athletes' profiles.</description>

      <title>A Selfish Herd with a Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most striking phenomena in biological systems is the tendency for biological agents to spatially aggregate, and subsequently display further collective behaviours such as rotational motion. One prominent explanation for why agents tend to aggregate is known as the selfish herd hypothesis (SHH). The SHH proposes that each agent has a "domain of danger" whose area is proportional to the risk of predation. The SHH proposes that aggregation occurs as a result of agents seeking to minimise the area of their domain. Subsequent attempts to model the SHH have had varying success in displaying aggregation, and have mostly been unable to exhibit further collective behaviours, such as aligned motion or milling. Here, we introduce a model that seeks to generalise the principles of previous SHH models, by allowing agents to aim for domains of a specific (possibly non-minimal) area or a range of areas and study the resulting collective dynamics. Moreover, the model incorporates the lack of information that biological agents have by limiting the range of movement and vision of the agents. The model shows that the possibility of further collective motion is heavily dependent on the domain area the agents aim for - with several distinct phases of collective behaviour.</description>

      <title>MyData: A Comprehensive Database of Mycetoma Tissue Microscopic Images for Histopathological Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mycetoma is a chronic and neglected inflammatory disease prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. It can lead to severe disability and social stigma. The disease is classified into two types based on the causative microorganisms: eumycetoma (fungal) and actinomycetoma (bacterial). Effective treatment strategies depend on accurately identifying the causative agents. Current identification methods include molecular, cytological, and histopathological techniques, as well as grain culturing. Among these, histopathological techniques are considered optimal for use in endemic areas, but they require expert pathologists for accurate identification, which can be challenging in rural areas lacking such expertise. The advent of digital pathology and automated image analysis algorithms offers a potential solution. This report introduces a novel dataset designed for the automated detection and classification of mycetoma using histopathological images. It includes the first database of microscopic images of mycetoma tissue, detailing the entire pipeline from species distribution and patient sampling to acquisition protocols through histological procedures. The dataset consists of images from 142 patients, totalling 864 images, each annotated with binary masks indicating the presence of grains, facilitating both detection and segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Longitudinal Speech Sessions via Voice Assistant Systems for Early Detection of Cognitive Decline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a form of neurodegenerative disorder. Early identification of MCI is crucial for delaying its progression through timely interventions. Existing research has demonstrated the feasibility of detecting MCI using speech collected from clinical interviews or digital devices. However, these approaches typically analyze data collected at limited time points, limiting their ability to identify cognitive changes over time. This paper presents a longitudinal study using voice assistant systems (VAS) to remotely collect seven-session speech data at three-month intervals across 18 months. We propose two methods to improve MCI detection and the prediction of cognitive changes. The first method incorporates historical data, while the second predicts cognitive changes at two time points. Our results indicate improvements when incorporating historical data: the average F1-score for MCI detection improves from 58.6% to 71.2% (by 12.6%) in the case of acoustic features and from 62.1% to 75.1% (by 13.0%) in the case of linguistic features. Additionally, the prediction of cognitive changes achieves an F1-score of 73.7% in the case of acoustic features. These results confirm the potential of VAS-based speech sessions for early detection of cognitive decline.</description>

      <title>MixEHR-Nest: Identifying Subphenotypes within Electronic Health Records through Hierarchical Guided-Topic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic subphenotyping from electronic health records (EHRs)provides numerous opportunities to understand diseases with unique subgroups and enhance personalized medicine for patients. However, existing machine learning algorithms either focus on specific diseases for better interpretability or produce coarse-grained phenotype topics without considering nuanced disease patterns. In this study, we propose a guided topic model, MixEHR-Nest, to infer sub-phenotype topics from thousands of disease using multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, MixEHR-Nest detects multiple subtopics from each phenotype topic, whose prior is guided by the expert-curated phenotype concepts such as Phenotype Codes (PheCodes) or Clinical Classification Software (CCS) codes. We evaluated MixEHR-Nest on two EHR datasets: (1) the MIMIC-III dataset consisting of over 38 thousand patients from intensive care unit (ICU) from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, USA; (2) the healthcare administrative database PopHR, comprising 1.3 million patients from Montreal, Canada. Experimental results demonstrate that MixEHR-Nest can identify subphenotypes with distinct patterns within each phenotype, which are predictive for disease progression and severity. Consequently, MixEHR-Nest distinguishes between type 1 and type 2 diabetes by inferring subphenotypes using CCS codes, which do not differentiate these two subtype concepts. Additionally, MixEHR-Nest not only improved the prediction accuracy of short-term mortality of ICU patients and initial insulin treatment in diabetic patients but also revealed the contributions of subphenotypes. For longitudinal analysis, MixEHR-Nest identified subphenotypes of distinct age prevalence under the same phenotypes, such as asthma, leukemia, epilepsy, and depression. The MixEHR-Nest software is available at GitHub: https://github.com/li-lab-mcgill/MixEHR-Nest.</description>

      <title>DPLM-2: A Multimodal Diffusion Protein Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are essential macromolecules defined by their amino acid sequences, which determine their three-dimensional structures and, consequently, their functions in all living organisms. Therefore, generative protein modeling necessitates a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and generate both sequences and structures. However, existing methods typically use separate models for each modality, limiting their ability to capture the intricate relationships between sequence and structure. This results in suboptimal performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce DPLM-2, a multimodal protein foundation model that extends discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) to accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable structural learning with the language model, 3D coordinates are converted to discrete tokens using a lookup-free quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both experimental and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint distribution of sequence and structure, as well as their marginals and conditionals. We also implement an efficient warm-up strategy to exploit the connection between large-scale evolutionary data and structural inductive biases from pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate highly compatible amino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D structures eliminating the need for a two-stage generation approach. Moreover, DPLM-2 demonstrates competitive performance in various conditional generation tasks, including folding, inverse folding, and scaffolding with multimodal motif inputs, as well as providing structure-aware representations for predictive tasks.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Processing Methods for the Study of Protein-Ligand Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have ignited interest in developing effective methods for predicting protein-ligand interactions (PLIs) given their relevance to drug discovery and protein engineering efforts and the ever-growing volume of biochemical sequence and structural data available. The parallels between human languages and the "languages" used to represent proteins and ligands have enabled the use of NLP machine learning approaches to advance PLI studies. In this review, we explain where and how such approaches have been applied in the recent literature and discuss useful mechanisms such as long short-term memory, transformers, and attention. We conclude with a discussion of the current limitations of NLP methods for the study of PLIs as well as key challenges that need to be addressed in future work.</description>

      <title>In-vivo high-resolution \chi-separation at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently introduced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, $\chi$-separation, offers the capability to separate paramagnetic ($\chi_{\text{para}}$) and diamagnetic ($\chi_{\text{dia}}$) susceptibility distribution within the brain. In-vivo high-resolution mapping of iron and myelin distribution, estimated by $\chi$-separation, could provide a deeper understanding of brain substructures, assisting the investigation of their functions and alterations. This can be achieved using 7T MRI, which benefits from a high signal-to-noise ratio and susceptibility effects. However, applying $\chi$-separation at 7T presents difficulties due to the requirement of an $R_2$ map, coupled with issues such as high specific absorption rate (SAR), large $B_1$ transmit field inhomogeneities, and prolonged scan time.
  To address these challenges, we developed a novel deep neural network, R2PRIMEnet7T, designed to convert a 7T $R_2^*$ map into a 3T $R_2'$ map. Building on this development, we present a new pipeline for $\chi$-separation at 7T, enabling us to generate high-resolution $\chi$-separation maps from multi-echo gradient-echo data. The proposed method is compared with alternative pipelines, such as an end-to-end network and linearly-scaled $R_2'$, and is validated against $\chi$-separation maps at 3T, demonstrating its accuracy. The 7T $\chi$-separation maps generated by the proposed method exhibit similar contrasts to those from 3T, while 7T high-resolution maps offer enhanced clarity and detail. Quantitative analysis confirms that the proposed method surpasses the alternative pipelines. The proposed method results well delineate the detailed brain structures associated with iron and myelin. This new pipeline holds promise for analyzing iron and myelin concentration changes in various neurodegenerative diseases through precise structural examination.</description>
