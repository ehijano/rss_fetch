      <title>Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) correspond to the thermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (C-O WD) star in a binary system, triggered by the accretion of material from another star, or the merger/collision with a secondary WD. Their phenomenal luminosity -- several billion times that of the sun -- has motivated their use as cosmological distance indicators and led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. SNe Ia are also the main producers of iron and hence play a fundamental role in the chemical evolution of galaxies. While recent observations have confirmed the basic theoretical picture of an exploding C-O WD star whose luminosity is powered by the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, a number of uncertainties remain concerning the nature of the binary companion and the explosion mechanism. Several lines of evidence point towards the existence of multiple progenitor channels in order to explain the full range of the observed diversity. A complete physical understanding of these energetic stellar explosions remains a long-lasting goal of modern astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The effect of opacity on neutron star Type I X-ray burst quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One long standing tension between theory and observations of Type I X-ray burst is the accretion rate at which the burst disappear due to stabilization of the nuclear burning that powers them. This is observed to happen at roughly one third of the theoretical expectations. Various solutions have been proposed, the most notable of which is the addition of a yet unknown source of heat in the upper layers of the crust, below the burning envelope. In this paper we ran several simulations using the 1D code MESA to explore the impact of opacity on the threshold mass accretion rate after which the bursts disappear, finding that a higher than expected opacity in the less dense layers near the surface has a stabilizing effect.</description>

      <title>Modeling the X-ray emission of the Boomerang nebula and implication for its potential ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boomerang nebula is a bright radio and X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by an energetic pulsar, PSR~J2229+6114. It is spatially coincident with one of the brightest ultrahigh-energy (UHE, $\ge 100$\,TeV) gamma-ray sources, LHAASO~J2226+6057. While X-ray observations have provided radial profiles for both the intensity and photon index of the nebula, previous theoretical studies have not reached an agreement on their physical interpretation, which also lead to different anticipation of the UHE emission from the nebula. In this work, we model its X-ray emission with a dynamical evolution model of PWN, considering both convective and diffusive transport of electrons. On the premise of fitting the X-ray intensity and photon index profiles, we find that the magnetic field within the Boomerang nebula is weak ($\sim 10\mu$G in the core region and diminishing to $1\mu\,G$ at the periphery), which therefore implies a significant contribution to the UHE gamma-ray emission by the inverse Compton (IC) radiation of injected electron/positron pairs. Depending on the particle transport mechanism, the UHE gamma-ray flux contributed by the Boomerang nebula via the IC radiation may constitute about $10-50\%$ of the flux of LHAASO~J2226+6057 at 100\,TeV, and up to 30\% at 500\,TeV. Finally, we compare our results with previous studies and discuss potential hadronic UHE emission from the PWN. In our modeling, most of the spindown luminosity of the pulsar may be transformed into thermal particles or relativistic protons.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the non-thermal X-ray emission from the supernova remnant CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed X-ray investigation of a region (S1) exhibiting non-thermal X-ray emission within the supernova remnant (SNR) CTB 37B hosting the magnetar CXOU J171405.7$-$381031. Previous analyses modeled this emission with a power law (PL), inferring various values for the photon index ($\Gamma$) and absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$). Based on these, S1 was suggested to be the SNR shell, a background pulsar wind nebula (PWN), or an interaction region between the SNR and a molecular cloud. Our analysis of a larger dataset favors a steepening (broken or curved PL) spectrum over a straight PL, with the best-fit broken power-law (BPL) parameters of $\Gamma=1.23\pm0.23$ and $2.24\pm0.16$ below and above a break at $5.57\pm0.52$ keV, respectively. However, a simple PL or srcut model cannot be definitively ruled out. For the BPL model, the inferred $N_{\rm H}=(4.08\pm0.72)\times 10^{22}\rm \ cm^{-2}$ towards S1 is consistent with that of the SNR, suggesting a physical association. The BPL-inferred spectral break $\Delta \Gamma \approx 1$ and hard $\Gamma$ can be naturally explained by a non-thermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) model. We present an evolutionary NTB model that reproduces the observed spectrum, which indicates the presence of sub-relativistic electrons within S1. However, alternate explanations for S1, an unrelated PWN or the SNR shock with unusually efficient acceleration, cannot be ruled out. We discuss these explanations and their implications for gamma-ray emission from CTB 37B, and describe future observations that could settle the origin of S1.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.
  Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.
  Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.
  Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>

      <title>First Searches for Dark Matter with the KM3NeT Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect dark matter detection methods are used to observe the products of dark matter annihilations or decays originating from astrophysical objects where large amounts of dark matter are thought to accumulate. With neutrino telescopes, an excess of neutrinos is searched for in nearby dark matter reservoirs, such as the Sun and the Galactic Centre, which could potentially produce a sizeable flux of Standard Model particles.
  The KM3NeT infrastructure, currently under construction, comprises the ARCA and ORCA undersea \v{C}erenkov neutrino detectors located at two different sites in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore of Italy and France, respectively. The two detector configurations are optimised for the detection of neutrinos of different energies, enabling the search for dark matter particles with masses ranging from a few GeV/c$^2$ to hundreds of TeV/c$^2$. In this work, searches for dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with data samples taken with the first configurations of both detectors are presented. No significant excess over the expected background was found in either of the two analyses. Limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation cross section of dark matter particles are computed for five different primary annihilation channels in the Galactic Centre. For the Sun, limits on the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross sections of dark matter with nucleons are given for three annihilation channels.</description>

      <title>Early Detection of Multiwavelength Blazar Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with relativistic jets pointing toward the observer. They are notable for their flux variability at all observed wavelengths and timescales. Together with simultaneous measurements at lower energies, the very-high-energy (VHE) emission observed during blazar flares may be used to probe the population of accelerated particles. However, optimally triggering observations of blazar high states can be challenging. Notable examples include identifying a flaring episode in real time and predicting VHE flaring activity based on lower energy observables. For this purpose, we have developed a novel deep learning analysis framework, based on data-driven anomaly detection techniques. It is capable of detecting various types of anomalies in real-world, multiwavelength light curves, ranging from clear high states to subtle correlations across bands. Based on unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering methods, we differentiate source variability from noisy background activity, without the need for a labeled training dataset of flaring states. The framework incorporates measurement uncertainties and is robust given data quality challenges, such as varying cadences and observational gaps. We evaluate our approach using both historical data and simulations of blazar light curves in two energy bands, corresponding to sources observable with the Fermi Large Area Telescope, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). In a statistical analysis, we show that our framework can reliably detect known historical flares.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger emission from magnetic reconnection in blazar jets: the case of TXS 0506+056</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements from astroparticle experiments, such as the 2017 flare associated with the source TXS 0506+056, indicate that blazars act as multi-messenger (MM; radiation and neutrinos) factories. Theoretically, the particle acceleration mechanisms responsible for blazar emissions and the precise location within the jet where this occurs remain undetermined. This paper explores MM emission driven by magnetic reconnection in a blazar jet. Previous studies have shown that reconnection in the magnetically dominated regions of these relativistic jets can efficiently accelerate particles to very high energies (VHE). Assuming that turbulent-driven magnetic reconnection accelerates cosmic-ray protons and electrons by a Fermi process, we developed a lepto-hadronic radiation model without the influence of external soft-photons to explain the 2017 MM flare from TXS 0506+056. In the proposed scenario, the emission blob moves downstream in the jet from $\sim$2 to 4 pc from the central engine, which is a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of $3 \times 10^{8}$ M$_\odot$ launching a jet with $150L_\mathrm{Edd}$ power. As the blob moves, we observe a sequence of spectral energy distribution (SED) profiles that match the observed arrival of the high energy neutrino and electromagnetic emission from TXS 0506+056. This arrival coincides with the high state of intermediate energy $\gamma$-rays ($E \sim 1 $ GeV) detection, followed by the subsequent appearance of the VHE $\gamma$-ray signal and then no further significant neutrino detection. We obtain a time delay between the neutrino and VHE events $\simeq 6.4$ days, which is consistent with that observed in the 2017 MM flare.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays versus Models of High Energy Hadronic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the consistency of hadronic interaction models in the CORSIKA simulation package with publicly available fluorescence telescope data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. By comparing the first few central moments of the extended air shower depth maximum distributions, as extracted from measured events, to those predicted by the best-fit inferred compositions, we derive a statistical measure of the consistency of a given hadronic model with data. To mitigate possible systematic biases, we include all primaries up to iron, compensate for the differences between the measured and simulated energy spectra of cosmic rays and account for other known systematic effects. Additionally, we study the effects of including higher central moments in the fit and project our results to larger statistics.</description>

      <title>Mass-loss, composition and observational signatures of stellar winds from X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-Ray bursts (XRBs) are powerful thermonuclear events on the surface of accreting neutron stars (NSs), which can synthesize intermediate-mass elements. Although the high surface gravity prevents an explosive ejection, a small fraction of the envelope may be ejected by radiation-driven winds. In our previous works, we have developed a non-relativistic radiative wind model and coupled it to an XRB hydrodynamic simulation. We now apply this technique to another model featuring consecutive bursts. We determine the mass-loss and chemical composition of the wind ejecta. Results show that, for a representative XRB, about $0.1\%$ of the envelope mass is ejected per burst, at an average rate of $3.9 \times 10^{-12}\,M_\odot \texttt{yr}^{-1}$. Between $66\%$ and $76\%$ of the ejecta composition is $^{60}$Ni, $^{64}$Zn, $^{68}$Ge, $^{4}$He and $^{58}$Ni. We also report on the evolution of observational quantities during the wind phase and simulate NICER observations that resemble those of 4U 1820-40.</description>

      <title>First spectropolarimetric observation of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 3+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first simultaneous X-ray spectropolarimetric observation of the bright atoll neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 3+1, performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) joint with NICER and NuSTAR. The source does not exhibit significant polarization in the 2-8 keV energy band, with an upper limit of 1.3% at a 99% confidence level on the polarization degree. The observed spectra can be well described by a combination of thermal disk emission, the hard Comptonization component, and reflected photons off the accretion disk. In particular, from the broad Fe K$\alpha$ line profile, we were able to determine the inclination of the system ($i \approx 36^\circ$), which is crucial for comparing the observed polarization with theoretical models. Both the spectral and polarization properties of GX 3+1 are consistent with those of other atoll sources observed by IXPE. Therefore, we may expect a similar geometrical configuration for the accreting system and the hot Comptonizing region. The low polarization is also consistent with the low inclination of the system.</description>

      <title>SN 2023adsy -- a normal Type Ia Supernova at z=2.9, discovered by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z = 2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. In this paper we show that the red color and faint peak magnitude could be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust in the host galaxy. If host galaxy extinction is accounted for, the parameters of the best-fit light curve templates in the SALT3-NIR model are compatible with a slowly declining, but still normal SN Ia. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the LambdaCDM cosmology (assuming H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and OmegaM = 0.315) on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z &gt; 2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2 &lt; z &lt; 3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, a number of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known. We studied, in detail what happens to the X-ray spectrum during the CL events using the example of the nearby CL Seyfert NGC1566, which was observed by Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. We applied the Comptonization model to describe an evolution of NGC~1566 X-ray spectra during outbursts and compared these results with a typical behavior for other AGNs to identify some differences and common properties that can ultimately help us to better understand the physics of the CL phenomenon. We found that changes in the X-ray properties of NGC1566 are characterized by a different combination of Sy1 (using 1H0707-495 as a representative) and Sy2 properties (using NGC7679 and Mrk3 as their representatives). At high X-ray luminosities NGC1566 exhibits the behavior typical for Sy1, and at low luminosities we see a transition of NGC1566 from the Sy1 behavior to the Sy2 pattern. We revealed the saturation of the spectral indices, \=a for these four AGNs during outbursts (\=a_1566~1.1, \=a _0707~2, \=a _7679~0.9 and \=a_mrk3~0.9) and determined the masses of the black holes (BHs) in the centers of these AGNs namely, M_0707~6.8x10^7 M_sol, M_7679~8.4x10^6 M_sol, M_mrk3~2.2x10^8 M_sol and M_1566~2x10^5 M_sol, applying the scaling method. Our spectral analysis shows that the changing-look of NGC1566 from Sy1.2 to Sy1.9 in 2019 was accompanied by the transition of NGC1566 to an accretion regime which is typical for the intermediate and highly soft spectral states of other BHs. We also find that when going from Sy2 to Sy1, the spectrum of NGC1566 shows an increase in the soft excess accompanied by a decrease in the Comptonized fraction (0.1&lt;f&lt;0.5), which is consistent with the typical behavior of BH sources during X-ray outburst decay.</description>

      <title>Quantum Criticality in Black Hole Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Teukolsky equation describing scattering from Kerr black holes captures a few important effects in the process of binary mergers, such as tidal deformations and the decay of ringdown modes, thereby raising interest in the structure of its solutions. In this letter we identify critical phenomena emerging in the corresponding phase space. One special point exists in this phase space, where the black hole is extremal and the scattered wave lies exactly at the superradiant bound, at which the physics simplifies considerably. We provide an indirect realization of a conformal symmetry emerging at this configuration, which leads to its interpretation as a critical point. Away from the critical point conformal symmetry is broken, but it is shown that critical fluctuations continue to be dominant in a wide range of parameters and at finite black hole temperatures. As in quantum many-body systems, the physics in this regime is described exclusively by the temperature and a set of critical exponents, therefore leading to robust predictions that are unique to the Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Properties of kaon-condensed phase in hyperon-mixed matter with three-baryon forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coexistent phase of kaon condensates and hyperons [($Y$+$K$) phase] in beta equilibrium with electrons and muons is investigated as a possible form of dense hadronic phase with multi-strangeness. The effective chiral Lagrangian for kaon-baryon and kaon-kaon interactions is utilized within chiral symmetry approach in combination with the interaction model between baryons. For the baryon-baryon interactions, we adopt the minimal relativistic mean-field theory with exchange of scalar mesons and vector mesons between baryons without including the nonlinear self-interacting meson field terms. In addition, the universal three-baryon repulsion and the phenomenological three-nucleon attraction are introduced as density-dependent effective two-body potentials. The repulsive effects leading to stiff equation of state at high densities consist of both the two-baryon repulsion via the vector-meson exchange and the universal three-baryon repulsion. Interplay of kaon condensates with hyperons through chiral dynamics in dense matter is clarified, and resulting onset mechanisms of kaon condensation in hyperon-mixed matter and the equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase and characteristic features of the system are presented. It is shown that the slope $L$ of the symmetry energy controls the two-baryon repulsion beyond the saturation density and resulting stiffness of the equation of state. The stiffness of the equation of state in turn controls admixture of hyperons and the onset and development of kaon condensates as a result of competing effect between kaon condensates and hyperons. The equation of state with the ($Y$+$K$) phase becomes stiff enough to be consistent with recent observations of massive neutron stars. Static properties of neutron stars with the ($Y$+$K$) phase are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic gamma rays are a valid probe to search for fundamental physics. Some of these exotic and exciting scenarios are the subject of this contribution to the book. All current Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) have invested a great deal of time and resources in scouting these out. In this chapter, we focus on the case of indirect search for weakly interacting massive particles (Sec. 8.1) and that of search for axion-like particles (Sec. 8.2). We continue with less debated, yet interesting studies on the search for primordial black holes (Sec. 8.3), tau-neutrinos (8.4), and magnetic monopoles (8.5). Other scenarios of fundamental physics like the search for Lorentz Invariance violations are treated elsewhere in the book.
  We structured the contribution providing a self-contained (yet minimal) theoretical framework, as well as a complete report of all IACTs' published contribution to the topics under consideration (updated until 2022). Our aim is to provide a reference review as well as take a photograph of the effort of the current generation of IACTs and the challenges taken, in preparation of the next-generation instrument to come, the Cherenkov Telescope Array.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as Standard Candles for Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, fast radio bursts (FRBs) have become a thriving field in astronomy and cosmology. Due to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, they are useful to study the cosmic expansion and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the literature, the dispersion measure (DM) of FRB has been considered extensively. It could be used as an indirect proxy of the luminosity distance $d_L$ of FRB. The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\rm DM_{IGM}$ and $\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology. Could we avoid DM in studying cosmology? Could we instead consider the luminosity distance $d_L$ directly in the FRB cosmology? We are interested to find a way out for this problem in the present work. From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain the cosmological models. We also test the key factors affecting the calibration and the cosmological constraints. Notice that the results are speculative, since they are based on simulations for the future (instead of now). We stress that the point in the present work is just to propose a viable method and a workable pipeline using type Ib FRBs as standard candles for cosmology in the future.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Highly Ionized Outflow in the Quasi-periodically Erupting Source GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts recurring every few hours, associated with supermassive black holes. Many interpretations for QPEs were proposed since their recent discovery in 2019, including extreme mass ratio inspirals and accretion disk instabilities. But, as of today, their nature still remains debated. We perform the first high-resolution X-ray spectral study of a QPE source using the RGS gratings onboard XMM-Newton, leveraging nearly 2 Ms of exposure on GSN 069, the first discovered source of this class. We resolve several absorption and emission lines including a strong line pair near the N VII rest-frame energy, resembling the P-Cygni profile. We apply photoionization spectral models and identify the absorption lines as an outflow blueshifted by $1700-2900$ km/s, with a column density of about $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an ionization parameter $\log (\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1})$ of $3.9-4.6$. The emission lines are instead redshifted by up to 2900 km/s, and likely originate from the same outflow that imprints the absorption features, and covers the full $4\pi$ sky from the point of view of GSN 069. The column density and ionization are comparable to the outflows detected in some tidal disruption events, but this outflow is significantly faster and has a strong emission component. The outflow is more highly ionized when the system is in the phase during which QPEs are present, and from the limits we derive on its location, we conclude that the outflow is connected to the recent complex, transient activity of GSN 069 which began around 2010.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Emission and Morphology of the Pulsar Wind Nebula Candidate HAWC J2031+415</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first TeV gamma-ray source with no lower energy counterparts, TeV J2032+4130, was discovered by HEGRA. It appears in the third HAWC catalog as 3HWC J2031+415 and it is a bright TeV gamma-ray source whose emission has previously been resolved as 2 sources: HAWC J2031+415 and HAWC J2030+409. While HAWC J2030+409 has since been associated with the \emph{Fermi-LAT} Cygnus Cocoon, no such association for HAWC J2031+415 has yet been found. In this work, we investigate the spectrum and energy-dependent morphology of HAWC J2031+415. We associate HAWC J2031+415 with the pulsar PSR J2032+4127 and perform a combined multi-wavelength analysis using radio, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray emission. We conclude that HAWC J2031+415 and, by extension, TeV J2032+4130 are most probably a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J2032+4127.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stochastic Template Bank using Inner Product Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave searches are crucial for studying compact sources like neutron stars and black holes. Many sensitive modeled searches use matched filtering to compare gravitational strain data to a set of waveform models known as template banks. We introduce a new stochastic placement method for constructing template banks, offering efficiency and flexibility to handle arbitrary parameter spaces, including orbital eccentricity, tidal deformability, and other extrinsic parameters. This method can be computationally limited by the ability to compare proposal templates with the accepted templates in the bank. To alleviate this computational load, we introduce the use of inner product inequalities to reduce the number of required comparisons. We also introduce a novel application of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation to enhance waveform coverage in sparser regions. Our approach has been employed to search for eccentric binary neutron stars, low-mass neutron stars, primordial black holes, supermassive black hole binaries. We demonstrate that our method produces self-consistent banks that recover the required minimum fraction of signals. For common parameter spaces, our method shows comparable computational performance and similar template bank sizes to geometric placement methods and stochastic methods, while easily extending to higher-dimensional problems. The time to run a search exceeds the time to generate the bank by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ for dedicated template banks, such as geometric, mass-only stochastic, and aligned spin cases, $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ for eccentric and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ for the tidal deformable bank. With the advent of efficient template bank generation, the primary area for improvement is developing more efficient search methodologies.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Astrophysical Priors on Parameter Inference for GW230529</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of prior selection on the inferred mass and spin parameters of the neutron star-black hole merger GW230529\_181500. Specifically, we explore models motivated by astrophysical considerations, including massive binary and pulsar evolution. We examine mass and spin distributions of neutron stars constrained by radio pulsar observations, alongside black hole spin observations from previous gravitational wave detections. We show that the inferred mass distribution highly depends upon the spin prior. Specifically, under the most restrictive, binary stellar evolution models, we obtain narrower distributions of masses with a black hole mass of $4.3^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\,M_{\odot}$and neutron star mass of $1.3^{+0.03}_{-0.03}\,M_{\odot}$ where, somewhat surprisingly, it is the prior on component spins which has the greatest impact on the inferred mass distributions. Re-weighting using neutron star mass and spin priors from observations of radio pulsars, with black hole spins from observations of gravitational waves, yields the black hole and the neutron star masses to be $3.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6} \,M_\odot$ and $1.4^{+0.2}_{-0.1} \,M_\odot$ respectively. The sequence of compact object formation -- whether the neutron star or the black hole formed first -- cannot be determined at the observed signal-to-noise ratio. However, there is no evidence that the black hole was tidally spun up.</description>

      <title>Detection of hidden emissions in two rotating radio transients with high surface magnetic fields</title>

Abstract: Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) are neutron stars emitting sporadic radio pulses. The unique emission of RRATs has been proposed to resemble those of known pulsar types, such as extreme nulling pulsars or pulsars with giant pulses. However, the presence of additional radiation beyond these sporadic pulses remains unclear. Through high-sensitivity observations and extended tracking, we detected the sequential weak emissions in two RRATs with relatively high surface magnetic fields (Bs &gt; 10^13 G): J1846-0257 and J1854+0306. These emissions show peak flux densities of 0.15 and 0.41 mJy, up to 687 and 512 times weaker than our detected RRAT single pulses, respectively. The weak emissions contribute small fractions (~ 16% and 5%) to the total radio pulse energy releases, contrasting significantly with giant-pulse pulsars where normal pulses dominate. Polarization analysis of J1854+0306 suggests that its sporadic RRAT pulses may originate from intermittent enhanced sparking processes due to magnetospheric evolution. Our findings indicate that some RRATs may represent a novel class of pulsars, distinct from any previously known subclass. Further observations of sources with similar rotational properties using high-sensitivity instruments could validate the generality of these hidden emissions.</description>

      <title>Rates and beaming angles of GRBs associated with compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some, if not all, binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and a fraction of neutron - star black hole (NSBH) mergers, are thought to produce sufficient mass-ejection to power Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). However, this fraction, as well as the distribution of beaming angles of BNS-associated GRBs, are poorly constrained from observation. Recent work applied machine learning tools to analyze GRB light curves observed by {\textit{Fermi}}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT. GRBs were segregated into multiple distinct clusters, with the tantalizing possibility that one of them (BNS cluster) could be associated with BNSs and another (NSBH cluster) with NSBHs. As a proof of principle, assuming that all GRBs detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT associated with BNSs (NSBHs) lie in the BNS (NSBH) cluster, we estimate their rates ($\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). We compare these rates with corresponding BNS and NSBH rates estimated by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration from the first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3). We find that the BNS rates are consistent with LVK's rate estimates, assuming a uniform distribution of beaming fractions ($f_b \in [0.01, 0.1]$). Conversely, using the LVK's BNS rate estimates, assuming all BNS mergers produce GRBs, we are able to constrain the beaming angle distribution to $\theta_j \in [0.8^{\circ}, 33.5^{\circ}]$ at $90\%$ confidence. We similarly place limits on the fraction of GRB-Bright NSBHs as $f_B \in [1.3\%, 63\%]$ ($f_B \in [0.4\%, 15\%]$) with {\it Fermi}/GBM ({\it Swift}/BAT) data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical confirmation for a black hole in the X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 ended its 10-month discovery outburst on June of 2024, when it reached an optical brightness comparable to pre-discovery magnitudes. With the aim of performing a dynamical study, we launched an optical spectroscopy campaign with the GTC telescope. We detect the companion star and construct its radial velocity curve, yielding a binary orbital period of Porb = 10.8038 +- 0.0010 h and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 390 +- 4 km/s. This results in a mass function of f(M1)=2.77 +- 0.09 Msun. Combined with constraints on the binary inclination, it sets a lower limit to the compact object mass of M1 &gt; 3.12 +- 0.10 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the accretor. Comparison of the average spectrum in the rest frame of the companion with synthetic stellar templates supports a K4V donor partially veiled (74%) by the accretion disc. A refined distance measurement of 3.7+- 0.3 kpc, together with the astrometric proper motion and the systemic velocity derived from the radial velocity curve (181 +-4 km/s), supports a natal kick velocity of 220 +40 -50 km/s, at the upper end of the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity and Thermal Hall Effect in Dense Electron-Ion Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall effect in electron-ion plasmas relevant to hot neutron stars, white dwarfs, and binary neutron star mergers, focusing on densities found in the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs. We consider plasma consisting of single species of ions, which could be either iron $\isotope[56]{Fe}$ or carbon $\isotope[12]{C}$ nuclei. The temperature range explored is from the melting temperature of the solid $T\sim10^9$~K up to $10^{11}$~K. This covers both degenerate and non-degenerate electron regimes. We find that thermal conductivity increases with density and temperature for which we provide analytical scaling relations valid in different regimes. The impact of magnetic fields on thermal conductivity is also analyzed, showing anisotropy in low-density regions and the presence of the thermal Hall effect characterized by the Righi--Leduc coefficient. The transition from a degenerate to non-degenerate regime is characterized by a minimum ratio of thermal conductivity to temperature, which is analogous to the minimum observed already in the case of electrical conductivity. We provide also formulas fit to our numerical results, which can be used in dissipative magneto-hydrodynamics simulations of warm compact stars.</description>

      <title>A splitting method for numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel splitting approach to numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) designed to expand its applicability to the domain of ultra-high magnetisation (high-$\sigma$). In this approach, the electromagnetic field is split into the force-free component and its perturbation due to the plasma inertia. Accordingly, the system of RMHD equations is extended to include the subsystem of force-free degenerate electrodynamics and the subsystem governing the plasma dynamics and the perturbation of the force-free field. The combined system of conservation laws is integrated simultaneously, to which aim various numerical techniques can be used, and the force-free field is recombined with its perturbation at the end of every timestep. To explore the potential of this splitting approach, we combined it with a 3rd-order WENO method, and carried out a variety of 1D and 2D test simulations. The simulations confirm the robustness of the splitting method in the high-$\sigma$ regime, and also show that it remains accurate in the low-$\sigma$ regime, all the way down to $\sigma$ = 0. Thus, the method can be used for simulating complex astrophysical flows involving a wide range of physical parameters. The numerical resistivity of the code obeys a simple ansatz and allows fast magnetic reconnection in the plasmoid-dominated regime. The results of simulations involving thin and long current sheets agree very well with the theory of resistive magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Black hole spin evolution across cosmic time from the NewHorizon simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical black holes (BHs) have two fundamental properties: mass and spin. While the mass-evolution of BHs has been extensively studied, much less work has been done on predicting the distribution of BH spins. In this paper we present the spin evolution for a sample of intermediate-mass and massive BHs from the newHorizon simulation, which evolved BH spin across cosmic time in a full cosmological context through gas accretion, BH-BH mergers and BH feedback including jet spindown. As BHs grow, their spin evolution alternates between being dominated by gas accretion and BH mergers. Massive BHs are generally highly spinning. Accounting for the spin energy extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism increases the scatter in BH spins, especially in the mass range $10^{5-7} \rm \ M_\odot$, where BHs had previously been predicted to be almost universally maximally spinning. We find no evidence for spin-down through efficient chaotic accretion. As a result of their high spin values, massive BHs have an average radiative efficiency of $&lt;\varepsilon_{\rm r}^{\rm thin}&gt; \approx 0.19$. As BHs spend much of their time at low redshift with a radiatively inefficient thick disc, BHs in our sample remain hard to observe. Different observational methods probe different sub-populations of BHs, significantly influencing the observed distribution of spins. Generally, X-ray-based methods and higher luminosity cuts increase the average observed BH spin. When taking BH spin evolution into account, BHs inject on average between 3 times (in quasar mode) and 8 times (in radio mode) as much feedback energy into their host galaxy as previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Origin of spectral bands in the Crab pulsar radio emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The model explaining the spectral "zebra" pattern of the high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) of the Crab pulsar radio emission is proposed. The observed emission bands are diffraction fringes in the spectral domain. The pulsar's own plasma-filled magnetosphere plays a role of a frequency-dependent "diffraction screen". The observed features such as the proportional band spacing, high polarization, constant position angle, and others are explained. The model allows one to perform "tomography" of the pulsar magnetosphere. Indeed, we have obtained the plasma density profile directly from observations, without assuming a particular magnetosphere. Our model is testable and several predictions are made. The two "high-frequency components" observed at the same frequencies as the HFIP are proposed to be related to HFIP.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a surprising radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the expected values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations), In this letter, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J18014-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J18014-338 are only stable for a 'stiff' low density phase. For a 'soft' hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>Simulating the LOcal Web (SLOW) -- III: Synchrotron emission from the local cosmic web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: Detecting diffuse synchrotron emission from the cosmic web is still a challenge for current radio telescopes. We aim to make predictions about the detectability of cosmic web filaments from simulations. Methods: We present the first cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a 500 $h^{-1} c$Mpc volume with an on-the-fly spectral cosmic ray (CR) model. This allows us to follow the evolution of populations of CR electrons and protons within every resolution element of the simulation. We modeled CR injection at shocks, while accounting for adiabatic changes to the CR population and high-energy-loss processes of electrons. The synchrotron emission was then calculated from the aged electron population, using the simulated magnetic field, as well as different models for the origin and amplification of magnetic fields. We used constrained initial conditions, which closely resemble the local Universe, and compared the results of the cosmological volume to a zoom-in simulation of the Coma cluster, to study the impact of resolution and turbulent reacceleration of CRs on the results. Results: We find a consistent injection of CRs at accretion shocks onto cosmic web filaments and galaxy clusters. This leads to diffuse emission from filaments of the order $S_\nu \approx 0.1 \: \mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ for a potential LOFAR observation at 144~MHz, when assuming the most optimistic magnetic field model. The flux can be increased by up to two orders of magnitude for different choices of CR injection parameters. This can bring the flux within a factor of ten of the current limits for direct detection. We find a spectral index of the simulated synchrotron emission from filaments of $\alpha \approx$ -1.0 -- -1.5 in the LOFAR band.</description>

Abstract: We describe a simple and efficient Python code to perform Bayesian forecasting for gravitational waves (GW) produced by Extreme-Mass-Ratio-Inspiral systems (EMRIs). The code runs on GPUs for an efficient parallelised computation of thousands of waveforms and sampling of the posterior through a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. EMRI_MC generates EMRI waveforms based on the so--called kludge scheme, and propagates it to the observer accounting for cosmological effects in the observed waveform due to modified gravity/dark energy. The code provides a helpful resource for forecasts for interferometry missions in the milli-Hz scale, e.g the satellite-mission LISA.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic origin of two dormant BH binaries: Gaia BH1 and Gaia BH2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two systems, namely, Gaia~BH1 and Gaia~BH2, that have been confirmed as dormant (i.e., no X-ray emission detected) black hole (BH) - low-mass star binaries in the latest Gaia mission data release (DR3) are intriguing in the context of their formation and evolution. Both systems consist of $\sim9$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ BH and $\sim1$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ star orbiting each other on a wide, eccentric orbit ($e\sim 0.5$). We argue that formation of such Gaia~BH-like systems through the isolated binary evolution (IBE) channel, under the standard common envelope assumptions, and from dynamical interactions in young massive and open clusters are equally probable, and that the formation rate of such binaries is of the order of $10^{-7}$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}^{-1}$ for both channels. We estimate that, according to our models, there are at most $\sim900$ detectable Gaia~BH-like binaries in the Milky Way thin disc. What plays an important role in formation of Gaia~BH-like systems via the IBE channel is the mutual position of the natal kick velocity vector and the binary angular momentum vector. We find that natal kicks with a median magnitude of $\sim40$ km/s are preferred for the formation of Gaia~BH1-like binaries. Approximately $94\%$ of those binaries are formed with the BH spin misaligned to the orbital axis by less than $40^{\circ}$. Gaia~BH2-like binaries form if the low velocity natal kick (of median magnitude $\sim20$ km/s) is directed within $15^{\circ}$ about the orbital plane. In addition to natal kick, we also discuss the influence of tidal interaction and the adopted common envelope $\lambda_\mathrm{ce}$~parameter prescription on the evolution of Gaia~BH-like binaries. We follow the subsequent evolution of the binaries, once formed as Gaia~BH1 and Gaia~BH2 systems, to investigate their connection with the low-mass X-ray binary population.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Abundance in First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario to obtain the correct relic abundance for thermally under-produced dark matter. This scenario utilizes a strongly first-order phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm PT}$ that gives rise to dark matter mass $m$. Freeze-out in the broken phase can yield the desired abundance in the entire region currently allowed by observational bounds and theoretical constraints for $10^2 T_{\rm PT} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^4 T_{\rm PT}$. We show that the accompanying gravitational waves are strong enough to be detected by many upcoming and proposed experiments. This, in tandem with dark matter indirect searches, provides a multi-messenger probe of such models. Positive signals in the future can help reconstruct the potential governing the phase transition and shed light on an underlying particle physics realization.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian templates for phase evolution of spherical extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present various post-Newtonian (PN) models for the phase evolution of compact objects moving along quasi-spherical orbits in Kerr spacetime derived by using the 12PN analytic formulas of the energy, angular momentum and their averaged rates of change calculated in the framework of the black hole perturbation theory. To examine the convergence of time-domain PN models (TaylorT families), we evaluate the dephasing between approximants with different PN orders. We found that the TaylorT1 model shows the best performance and the performance of the TaylorT2 is the next best. To evaluate the convergence of frequency-domain PN models (TaylorF families), we evaluate the mismatch between approximants with different orders. We found that the performance of the TaylorF2 model is comparable with the TaylorT2 model. Although the TaylorT2 and TaylorF2 models are not so accurate as the TaylorT1, the fully analytical expressions give us easy-to-handle templates and are useful to discuss effects beyond general relativity.</description>
