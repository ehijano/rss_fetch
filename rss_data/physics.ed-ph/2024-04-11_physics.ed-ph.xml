      <title>Introducing Quantum Information and Computation to a Broader Audience with MOOCs at OpenHPI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but very difficult to access. For this reason, numerous concepts are being developed worldwide on how quantum computing can be taught. This always raises questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to measure the success of the teaching concept. In 2022 and 2023, the authors gave a total of nine two-week MOOCs (massive open online courses) with different possible learning paths on the Hasso Plattner Institute's OpenHPI platform. The platform's purpose is to make computer science education available to everyone free of charge. The nine quantum courses form a self-contained curriculum. A total of 17157 course attendances have been taken by 7413 natural persons, and the number is still rising. This paper presents the course concept and then evaluates the anonymized data on the background of the participants, their behavior in the courses, and their learning success. In the present paper for the first time such a large dataset of MOOC-based quantum computing education is analyzed. The summarized results are a heterogeneous personal background of the participants biased towards IT professionals, a majority following the didactic recommendations, and a high success rate, which is strongly correlatatd to following the didactic recommendations. The amount of data from such a large group of quantum computing learners offers numerous starting points for further research in the field of quantum computing education.</description>
