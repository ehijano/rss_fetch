      <title>Modulation of switching dynamics in magnetic tunnel junctions for low-error-rate computational random-access memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional computer architecture has been facing challenges answering the ever-increasing demands from emerging applications, such as AI, for energy-efficient computation and memory hardware systems. Computational Random Access Memory (CRAM) represents a true in-memory computing paradigm that integrates logic and memory functions within the same array. At its core, CRAM relies on Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs), which serve as the foundational building blocks for implementing both memory storage and logic operations. However, a key challenge in CRAM lies in the non-ideal error rates associated with switching dynamics of MTJs, necessitating innovative approaches to reduce errors and optimize logic margins. This work demonstrates a technique of utilizing the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) to steepen the switching probability transfer curve (SPTC), thereby significantly reducing the logic operation error rate in CRAM. Using several numerical modeling tools, we validate the effectiveness of VCMA in modulating the energy barrier and switching dynamics in MTJs. It is revealed that the VCMA effect significantly reduces the error rate of CRAM by 61.43% at a VCMA coefficient of 200 fJ V-1 m-1 compared to CRAM without VCMA. The reduction of error rate is further rapidly amplified with an increasing TMR ratio. Furthermore, the introduction of the VCMA effect decreases the logic voltage (Vlogic) required for logic operations in CRAM and results in reduction of energy consumption. Our work serves as a first exploration reducing the error rate in CRAM by modifying SPTC in MTJs.</description>

      <title>State Characterisation of Self-Directed Channel Memristive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing how to reliably use memristors as information storage devices is crucial not only to their role as emerging memories, but also for their application in neural network acceleration and as components of novel neuromorphic systems. In order to better understand the dynamics of information storage on memristors, it is essential to be able to characterise and measure their state. To this end, in this paper we propose a general, physics-inspired modelling approach for characterising the state of self-directed channel (SDC) memristors. Additionally, to enable the identification of the proposed state from device data, we introduce a noise-aware approach to the minimum-variance estimation of the state from voltage and current pairs.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum Classical Pipeline for X Ray Based Fracture Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bone fractures are a leading cause of morbidity and disability worldwide, imposing significant clinical and economic burdens on healthcare systems. Traditional X ray interpretation is time consuming and error prone, while existing machine learning and deep learning solutions often demand extensive feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and high computational resources. To address these challenges, a distributed hybrid quantum classical pipeline is proposed that first applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then leverages a 4 qubit quantum amplitude encoding circuit for feature enrichment. By fusing eight PCA derived features with eight quantum enhanced features into a 16 dimensional vector and then classifying with different machine learning models achieving 99% accuracy using a public multi region X ray dataset on par with state of the art transfer learning models while reducing feature extraction time by 82%.</description>

      <title>Self Distillation via Iterative Constructive Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks have achieved remarkable achievements across various domains, however balancing performance and generalization still remains a challenge while training these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uses a cyclic optimization strategy to concurrently optimize the model and its input data for better training, rethinking the traditional training paradigm. Central to our approach is Iterative Constructive Perturbation (ICP), which leverages the model's loss to iteratively perturb the input, progressively constructing an enhanced representation over some refinement steps. This ICP input is then fed back into the model to produce improved intermediate features, which serve as a target in a self-distillation framework against the original features. By alternately altering the model's parameters to the data and the data to the model, our method effectively addresses the gap between fitting and generalization, leading to enhanced performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only mitigates common performance bottlenecks in neural networks but also demonstrates significant improvements across training variations.</description>

      <title>SurvUnc: A Meta-Model Based Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Survival Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis, which estimates the probability of event occurrence over time from censored data, is fundamental in numerous real-world applications, particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and risk assessment. Despite advances in numerous survival models, quantifying the uncertainty of predictions from these models remains underexplored and challenging. The lack of reliable uncertainty quantification limits the interpretability and trustworthiness of survival models, hindering their adoption in clinical decision-making and other sensitive applications. To bridge this gap, in this work, we introduce SurvUnc, a novel meta-model based framework for post-hoc uncertainty quantification for survival models. SurvUnc introduces an anchor-based learning strategy that integrates concordance knowledge into meta-model optimization, leveraging pairwise ranking performance to estimate uncertainty effectively. Notably, our framework is model-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with any survival model without requiring modifications to its architecture or access to its internal parameters. Especially, we design a comprehensive evaluation pipeline tailored to this critical yet overlooked problem. Through extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking datasets and five representative survival models, we demonstrate the superiority of SurvUnc across multiple evaluation scenarios, including selective prediction, misprediction detection, and out-of-domain detection. Our results highlight the effectiveness of SurvUnc in enhancing model interpretability and reliability, paving the way for more trustworthy survival predictions in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Quantum Digital Twins for Optimizing Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealers have shown potential in addressing certain combinatorial optimization problems, though their performance is often limited by scalability and errors rates. In this work, we propose a Neural Quantum Digital Twin (NQDT) framework that reconstructs the energy landscape of quantum many-body systems relevant to quantum annealing. The digital twin models both ground and excited state dynamics, enabling detailed simulation of the adiabatic evolution process. We benchmark NQDT on systems with known analytical solutions and demonstrate that it accurately captures key quantum phenomena, including quantum criticality and phase transitions. Leveraging this framework, one can identify optimal annealing schedules that minimize excitation-related errors. These findings highlight the utility of neural network-based digital twins as a diagnostic and optimization tool for improving the performance of quantum annealers.</description>

      <title>Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17523v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Q-gen: A Parameterized Quantum Circuit Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike most classical algorithms that take an input and give the solution directly as an output, quantum algorithms produce a quantum circuit that works as an indirect solution to computationally hard problems. In the full quantum computing workflow, most data processing remains in the classical domain except for running the quantum circuit in the quantum processor. This leaves massive opportunities for classical automation and optimization toward future utilization of quantum computing. We kickstart the first step in this direction by introducing Q-gen, a high-level, parameterized quantum circuit generator incorporating 15 realistic quantum algorithms. Each customized generation function comes with algorithmspecific parameters beyond the number of qubits, providing a large generation volume with high circuit variability. To demonstrate the functionality of Q-gen, we organize the algorithms into 5 hierarchical systems and generate a quantum circuit dataset accompanied by their measurement histograms and state vectors. This dataset enables researchers to statistically analyze the structure, complexity, and performance of large-scale quantum circuits, or quickly train novel machine learning models without worrying about the exponentially growing simulation time. Q-gen is an open-source and multipurpose project that serves as the entrance for users with a classical computer science background to dive into the world of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A Path to Universal Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.</description>
