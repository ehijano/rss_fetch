      <title>Payne-P\'olya-Weinberger inequalities on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Payne-P\'olya-Weinberger inequalities are known to be exclusive to bounded Euclidean domains with Dirichlet boundary condition. In this paper, we discuss the corresponding inequalities on Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n \geq3$, and we prove explicit bounds in terms of geometric quantities such as scalar curvature, Yamabe constant, isoperimetric constant and conformal volume.</description>

      <title>Fully personalized PageRank and algebraic methods to distribute a random walker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of algebraic methods for controlling the stationary distribution of PageRank-like random walkers. Building upon existing literature, we compile and extend results regarding both structural control (through network modifications) and parametric control (through measure parameters) of these centralities. We characterize the conditions for complete control of centrality scores and the weaker notion of ranking control, establishing bounds for the required parameters. Our analysis includes classical PageRank alongside two generalizations: node-dependent dampings and node-dependent personalization vector, with the latter being a novel idea in the literature. We examine how their underlying random walk structures affect their controllability, and we also investigate the concepts of competitors and leaders in centrality rankings, providing insights into how parameter variations can influence node importance hierarchies. These results advance our understanding of the interplay between algebraic control and stochastic dynamics in network centrality measures.</description>

      <title>The Schr\"oder-Bernstein property for operators on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that the complete theory of a Hilbert space equipped with a normal operator has the Schr\"oder-Berenstein property. This in particular answers a question of Argoty, Berenstein, and the first-named author. We also prove an analogous statement for unbounded self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>Orthogonalisability of joins of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is said to be orthogonalisable if the set of real symmetric matrices whose off-diagonal pattern is prescribed by its edges contains an orthogonal matrix. We determine some necessary and some sufficient conditions on the sizes of the connected components of two graphs for their join to be orthogonalisable. In some cases, those conditions coincide, and we present several families of joins of graphs that are orthogonalisable.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic perturbation theory for Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory is tailored for one-body Schr\"odinger operators perturbed by long-range magnetic fields. In this work we present a self-contained exposition of the method, by outlining its technical foundations and discussing the physical heuristics behind the proofs. We apply it in order to prove the stability of spectral gaps and to study the location of the discrete spectrum. We also analyze the (lack of) continuity with respect to the magnetic field of spectral projections corresponding to finite spectral islands, which is a particularly important situation for systems modelling Chern insulators. Finally, we show how to construct approximate projections that have an explicit dependence with respect to the magnetic field parameter.</description>

      <title>Stability of the second non trivial eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, building on the ideas of Brasco and Pratelli (Geom. Funct. Anal., 22 (2012), 107-135), we establish a stability estimate for Bucur and Henrot's inequality (Acta Math., 222 (2019), 337-361). Their inequality asserts that, among regular sets of given measure, the disjoint union of two balls with the same radius maximizes the second non trivial eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian. Last week I was informed of the same result of this paper has been published by Wang K, Wu H. A quantitative Bucur Henrot inequality. Mathematische Nachrichten, 2022, 295(12): 2436-2451. So thearticle has been deprecated.</description>

      <title>Continuous spectrum-shrinking maps and applications to preserver problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$ let $\mathcal{X}_n$ be either the algebra $M_n$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices, the set $N_n$ of all $n \times n$ normal matrices, or any of the matrix Lie groups $\mathrm{GL}(n)$, $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{U}(n)$. We first give a short and elementary argument that for two positive integers $m$ and $n$ there exists a continuous spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_m$ (i.e.\ $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(X))\subseteq \mathrm{sp}(X)$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$. Moreover, in that case we have the equality of characteristic polynomials $k_{\phi(X)}(\cdot) = k_{X}(\cdot)^\frac{m}{n}$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$, which in particular shows that $\phi$ preserves spectra. Using this we show that whenever $n \geq 3$, any continuous commutativity preserving and spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_n$ is of the form $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)T^{-1}$ or $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)^tT^{-1}$, for some $T\in \mathrm{GL}(n)$. The analogous results fail for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ but hold for the spaces of semisimple elements in either $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n)$. As a consequence, we also recover (a strengthened version of) \v{S}emrl's influential characterization of Jordan automorphisms of $M_n$ via preserving properties.</description>

Abstract: As a corollary of our main results, we prove that for any connected $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic graph, when edge weights and potentials are treated as variables, the corresponding periodic graph operators generically (i.e., outside a proper algebraic subset of the variable space) do not have flat bands.</description>

      <title>Spectral Determinants of Almost Equilateral Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kirchoff's matrix tree theorem of 1847 connects the number of spanning trees of a graph to the spectral determinant of the discrete Laplacian [22]. Recently an analogue was obtained for quantum graphs relating the number of spanning trees to the spectral determinant of a Laplacian acting on functions on a metric graph with standard (Neumann-like) vertex conditions [20]. This result holds for quantum graphs where the edge lengths are close together. A quantum graph where the edge lengths are all equal is called equilateral. Here we consider equilateral graphs where we perturb the length of a single edge (almost equilateral graphs). We analyze the spectral determinant of almost equilateral complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and circulant graphs. This provides a measure of how fast the spectral determinant changes with respect to changes in an edge length. We apply these results to estimate the width of a window of edge lengths where the connection between the number of spanning trees and the spectral determinant can be observed. The results suggest the connection holds for a much wider window of edge lengths than is required in [20].</description>

      <title>Non-linear correlations underlie linear response and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.</description>

      <title>Spectral Properties of Positive Definite Matrices over Symmetrized Tropical Algebras and Valued Ordered fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of positive definite and positive semi-definite symmetric matrices within the framework of symmetrized tropical algebra, an extension of tropical algebra adapted to ordered valued fields.
  We focus on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices. We
  prove that the eigenvalues of a positive (semi)-definite matrix in the tropical symmetrized setting coincide with its diagonal entries. Then, we show that the images by the valuation of the eigenvalues of a positive definite matrix over a valued nonarchimedean ordered field coincide with the eigenvalues of an associated matrix in the symmetrized tropical algebra. Moreover, under a genericity condition, we characterize the images of the eigenvectors under the map keeping track both of the nonarchimedean valuation and sign, showing that they coincide with tropical eigenvectors in the symmetrized algebra. These results offer new insights into the spectral theory of matrices over tropical semirings, and provide combinatorial formul\ae\ for log-limits of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of parametric families of real positive definite matrices.</description>
