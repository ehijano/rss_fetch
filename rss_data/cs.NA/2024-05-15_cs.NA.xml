      <title>Parallel-in-Time Iterative Methods for Pricing American Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For pricing American options, %after suitable discretization in space and time, a sequence of discrete linear complementarity problems (LCPs) or equivalently Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations need to be solved in a sequential time-stepping manner. In each time step, the policy iteration or its penalty variant is often applied due to their fast convergence rates. In this paper, we aim to solve for all time steps simultaneously, by applying the policy iteration to an ``all-at-once form" of the HJB equations, where two different parallel-in-time preconditioners are proposed to accelerate the solution of the linear systems within the policy iteration. Our proposed methods are generally applicable for such all-at-once forms of the HJB equation, arising from option pricing problems with optimal stopping and nontrivial underlying asset models. Numerical examples are presented to show the feasibility and robust convergence behavior of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>A Local discontinuous Galerkin method for the Benajamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to design a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the Benjamin-Ono equation. We analyze the stability and error estimates for the semi-discrete LDG scheme. We prove that the scheme is $L^2$-stable and it converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1/2})$ for general nonlinear flux. Furthermore, we develop a fully discrete LDG scheme using the four-stage fourth order Runge-Kutta method and ensure the devised scheme is strongly stable in case of linear flux using two-step and three-step stability approach under an appropriate time step constraint. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>Subspace method based on neural networks for solving the partial differential equation in weak form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a subspace method based on neural networks for solving the partial differential equation in weak form with high accuracy. The basic idea of our method is to use some functions based on neural networks as base functions to span a subspace, then find an approximate solution in this subspace. Training base functions and finding an approximate solution can be separated, that is different methods can be used to train these base functions, and different methods can also be used to find an approximate solution. In this paper, we find an approximate solution of the partial differential equation in the weak form. Our method can achieve high accuracy with low cost of training. Numerical examples show that the cost of training these base functions is low, and only one hundred to two thousand epochs are needed for most tests. The error of our method can fall below the level of $10^{-7}$ for some tests. The proposed method has the better performance in terms of the accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>A Well-Balanced Method for an Unstaggered Central Scheme, the one-space Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new MUSCL scheme by combining the ideas of the Kurganov and Tadmor scheme and the so-called Deviation method which results in a well-balanced finite volume method for the hyperbolic balance laws, by evolving the difference between the exact solution and a given stationary solution. After that, we derive a semi-discrete scheme from this new scheme and it can be shown to be essentially TVD when applied to a scalar conservation law. In the end, we apply and validate the developed methods by numerical experiments and solve classical problems featuring Euler equations with gravitational source term.</description>

      <title>PTPI-DL-ROMs: pre-trained physics-informed deep learning-based reduced order models for nonlinear parametrized PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and deep learning-based ROMs (DL-ROMs) has proved to be a successful strategy to construct non-intrusive, highly accurate, surrogates for the real time solution of parametric nonlinear time-dependent PDEs. Inexpensive to evaluate, POD-DL-ROMs are also relatively fast to train, thanks to their limited complexity. However, POD-DL-ROMs account for the physical laws governing the problem at hand only through the training data, that are usually obtained through a full order model (FOM) relying on a high-fidelity discretization of the underlying equations. Moreover, the accuracy of POD-DL-ROMs strongly depends on the amount of available data. In this paper, we consider a major extension of POD-DL-ROMs by enforcing the fulfillment of the governing physical laws in the training process -- that is, by making them physics-informed -- to compensate for possible scarce and/or unavailable data and improve the overall reliability. To do that, we first complement POD-DL-ROMs with a trunk net architecture, endowing them with the ability to compute the problem's solution at every point in the spatial domain, and ultimately enabling a seamless computation of the physics-based loss by means of the strong continuous formulation. Then, we introduce an efficient training strategy that limits the notorious computational burden entailed by a physics-informed training phase. In particular, we take advantage of the few available data to develop a low-cost pre-training procedure; then, we fine-tune the architecture in order to further improve the prediction reliability. Accuracy and efficiency of the resulting pre-trained physics-informed DL-ROMs (PTPI-DL-ROMs) are then assessed on a set of test cases ranging from non-affinely parametrized advection-diffusion-reaction equations, to nonlinear problems like the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Space-time stochastic Galerkin boundary elements for acoustic scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic emission or scattering problems naturally involve uncertainties about the sound sources or boundary conditions. This article initiates the study of time domain boundary elements for such stochastic boundary problems for the acoustic wave equation. We present a space-time stochastic Galerkin boundary element method which is applied to sound-hard, sound-soft and absorbing scatterers. Uncertainties in both the sources and the boundary conditions are considered using a polynomial chaos expansion. The numerical experiments illustrate the performance and convergence of the proposed method in model problems and present an application to a problem from traffic noise.</description>

      <title>Space-time boundary elements for frictional contact in elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies a boundary element method for dynamic frictional contact between linearly elastic bodies. We formulate these problems as a variational inequality on the boundary, involving the elastodynamic Poincar\'{e}-Steklov operator. The variational inequality is solved in a mixed formulation using boundary elements in space and time. In the model problem of unilateral Tresca friction contact with a rigid obstacle we obtain an a priori estimate for the resulting Galerkin approximations. Numerical experiments in two space dimensions demonstrate the stability, energy conservation and convergence of the proposed method for contact problems involving concrete and steel in the linearly elastic regime. They address both unilateral and two-sided dynamic contact with Tresca or Coulomb friction.</description>

      <title>Spectral approximation of convolution operators of Fredholm type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a method for constructing spectral approximations for convolution operators of Fredholm type. The algorithm we propose is numerically stable and takes advantage of the recurrence relations satisfied by the entries of such a matrix approximation. When used for computing the Fredholm convolution of two given functions, such approximations produce the convolution more rapidly than the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approximation also leads to a spectral method for solving the Fredholm convolution integral equations and enables the computation of eigenvalues and pseudospectra of Fredholm convolution operators, which is otherwise intractable with existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Double-activation neural network for solving parabolic equations with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the double-activation neural network (DANN), a novel network architecture designed for solving parabolic equations with time delay. In DANN, each neuron is equipped with two activation functions to augment the network's nonlinear expressive capacity. Additionally, a new parameter is introduced for the construction of the quadratic terms in one of two activation functions, which further enhances the network's ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships. To address the issue of low fitting accuracy caused by the discontinuity of solution's derivative, a piecewise fitting approach is proposed by dividing the global solving domain into several subdomains. The convergence of the loss function is proven. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the superior accuracy and faster convergence of DANN compared to the traditional physics-informed neural network (PINN).</description>

      <title>A regularized eigenmatrix method for unstructured sparse recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed data-driven eigenmatrix method shows very promising reconstruction accuracy in sparse recovery for a wide range of kernel functions and random sample locations. However, its current implementation can lead to numerical instability if the threshold tolerance is not appropriately chosen. To incorporate regularization techniques, we propose to regularize the eigenmatrix method by replacing the computation of an ill-conditioned pseudo-inverse by the solution of an ill-conditioned least square system, which can be efficiently treated by Tikhonov regularization. Extensive numerical examples confirmed the improved effectiveness of our proposed method, especially when the noise levels are relatively high.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Curvilinear Coordinate system-based Patch Dynamics Scheme in Equation-free Multiscale Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The patch dynamics scheme in equation-free multiscale modelling can efficiently predict the macroscopic behaviours by simulating the microscale problem in a fraction of the space-time domain. The patch dynamics schemes developed so far, are mainly on rectangular domains with uniform grids and uniform rectangular patches. In real-life problems where the geometry of the domain is not regular or simple, rectangular and uniform grids or patches may not be useful. To address this kind of complexity, the concept of a generalized curvilinear coordinate system is used. An explicit representation of a patch dynamics scheme on a generalized curvilinear coordinate system in a two-dimensional domain is proposed for evolution equations. It has been applied to unsteady convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) problems. The robustness of the scheme on the generalized curvilinear coordinate system is assessed through numerical test cases. Firstly, a convection-dominated CDR equation is considered, featuring high gradient regions in some part of the domain, for which stretched grids with non-uniform patch sizes are employed. Secondly, a non-axisymmetric diffusion equation is examined in an annulus region, where the patches have non-rectangular shapes. The results obtained demonstrate excellent agreement with the analytical solution or existing numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>An optimization-based construction procedure for function space based summation-by-parts operators on arbitrary grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel construction procedure for one-dimensional summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. Existing construction procedures for FSBP operators of the form $D = P^{-1} Q$ proceed as follows: Given a boundary operator $B$, the norm matrix $P$ is first determined and then in a second step the complementary matrix $Q$ is calculated to finally get the FSBP operator $D$. In contrast, the approach proposed here determines the norm and complementary matrices, $P$ and $Q$, simultaneously by solving an optimization problem. The proposed construction procedure applies to classical SBP operators based on polynomial approximation and the broader class of function space SBP (FSBP) operators. According to our experiments, the presented approach yields a numerically stable construction procedure and FSBP operators with higher accuracy for diagonal norm difference operators at the boundaries than the traditional approach. Through numerical simulations, we highlight the advantages of our proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of the stochastic heat equation with a distributional reaction term. Under a condition on the Besov regularity of the reaction term, it was proven recently that a strong solution exists and is unique in the pathwise sense, in a class of H\"older continuous processes. For a suitable choice of sequence $(b^k)_{k\in \mathbb{N}}$ approximating $b$, we prove that the error between the solution $u$ of the SPDE with reaction term $b$ and its tamed Euler finite-difference scheme with mollified drift $b^k$, converges to $0$ in $L^m(\Omega)$ with a rate that depends on the Besov regularity of $b$. In particular, one can consider two interesting cases: first, even when $b$ is only a (finite) measure, a rate of convergence is obtained. On the other hand, when $b$ is a bounded measurable function, the (almost) optimal rate of convergence $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon)$-in space and $(\frac{1}{4}-\varepsilon)$-in time is achieved. Stochastic sewing techniques are used in the proofs, in particular to deduce new regularising properties of the discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Power of $\ell_1$-Norm Regularized Kaczmarz Algorithms for High-Order Tensor Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors serve as a crucial tool in the representation and analysis of complex, multi-dimensional data. As data volumes continue to expand, there is an increasing demand for developing optimization algorithms that can directly operate on tensors to deliver fast and effective computations. Many problems in real-world applications can be formulated as the task of recovering high-order tensors characterized by sparse and/or low-rank structures. In this work, we propose novel Kaczmarz algorithms with a power of the $\ell_1$-norm regularization for reconstructing high-order tensors by exploiting sparsity and/or low-rankness of tensor data. In addition, we develop both a block and an accelerated variant, along with a thorough convergence analysis of these algorithms. A variety of numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and significant potential of the proposed methods in image and video processing tasks, such as image sequence destriping and video deconvolution.</description>

      <title>Sequential Maximal Updated Density Parameter Estimation for Dynamical Systems with Parameter Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for generating sequential parameter estimates and quantifying epistemic uncertainty in dynamical systems within a data-consistent (DC) framework. The DC framework differs from traditional Bayesian approaches due to the incorporation of the push-forward of an initial density, which performs selective regularization in parameter directions not informed by the data in the resulting updated density. This extends a previous study that included the linear Gaussian theory within the DC framework and introduced the maximal updated density (MUD) estimate as an alternative to both least squares and maximum a posterior (MAP) estimates. In this work, we introduce algorithms for operational settings of MUD estimation in real or near-real time where spatio-temporal datasets arrive in packets to provide updated estimates of parameters and identify potential parameter drift. Computational diagnostics within the DC framework prove critical for evaluating (1) the quality of the DC update and MUD estimate and (2) the detection of parameter value drift. The algorithms are applied to estimate (1) wind drag parameters in a high-fidelity storm surge model, (2) thermal diffusivity field for a heat conductivity problem, and (3) changing infection and incubation rates of an epidemiological model.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Evaluation of a Lightweight Analytic Vehicle Dynamics Model for Maneuver Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models for vehicle dynamics play an important role in maneuver planning for automated driving. They are used to derive trajectories from given control inputs, or to evaluate a given trajectory in terms of constraint violation or optimality criteria such as safety, comfort or ecology. Depending on the computation process, models with different assumptions and levels of detail are used; since maneuver planning usually has strong requirements for computation speed at a potentially high number of trajectory evaluations per planning cycle, most of the applied models aim to reduce complexity by implicitly or explicitly introducing simplifying assumptions. While evaluations show that these assumptions may be sufficiently valid under typical conditions, their effect has yet to be studied conclusively.
  We propose a model for vehicle dynamics that is convenient for maneuver planning by supporting both an analytic approach of extracting parameters from a given trajectory, and a generative approach of establishing a trajectory from given control inputs. Both applications of the model are evaluated in real-world test drives under dynamic conditions, both on a closed-off test track and on public roads, and effects arising from the simplifying assumptions are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Realtime Global Optimization of a Fail-Safe Emergency Stop Maneuver for Arbitrary Electrical / Electronical Failures in Automated Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08401</link>

Abstract: In the event of a critical system failures in auto-mated vehicles, fail-operational or fail-safe measures provide minimum guarantees for the vehicle's performance, depending on which of its subsystems remain operational. Various such methods have been proposed which, upon failure, use different remaining sets of operational subsystems to execute maneuvers that bring the vehicle into a safe state under different environmental conditions. One particular such method proposes a fail-safe emergency stop system that requires no particular electric or electronic subsystem to be available after failure, and still provides a basic situation-dependent emergency stop maneuver. This is achieved by preemptively setting parameters to a hydraulic / mechanical system prior to failure, which after failure executes the preset maneuver "blindly". The focus of this paper is the particular challenge of implementing a lightweight planning algorithm that can cope with the complex uncertainties of the given task while still providing a globally optimal solution at regular intervals, based on the perceived and predicted environment of the automated vehicle.</description>

      <title>Approaches to iterative algorithms for solving nonlinear equations with an application in tomographic absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an approach for solving systems of nonlinear equations without computing function derivatives. Motivated by the application area of tomographic absorption spectroscopy, which is a highly-nonlinear problem with variables coupling, we consider a situation where straightforward translation to a fixed point problem is not possible because the operators that represent the relevant systems of nonlinear equations are not self-mappings, i.e., they operate between spaces of different dimensions. To overcome this difficulty we suggest an "alternating common fixed points algorithm" that acts alternatingly on the different vector variables. This approach translates the original problem to a common fixed point problem for which iterative algorithms are abound and exhibits a viable alternative to translation to an optimization problem, which usually requires derivatives information. However, to apply any of these iterative algorithms requires to ascertain the conditions that appear in their convergence theorems. To circumvent the need to verify conditions for convergence, we propose and motivate a derivative-free algorithm that better suits the tomographic absorption spectroscopy problem at hand and is even further improved by applying to it the superiorization approach. This is presented along with experimental results that demonstrate our approach.</description>

      <title>Deflation for the off-diagonal block in symmetric saddle point systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deflation techniques are typically used to shift isolated clusters of small eigenvalues in order to obtain a tighter distribution and a smaller condition number. Such changes induce a positive effect in the convergence behavior of Krylov subspace methods, which are among the most popular iterative solvers for large sparse linear systems. We develop a deflation strategy for symmetric saddle point matrices by taking advantage of their underlying block structure. The vectors used for deflation come from an elliptic singular value decomposition relying on the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization process. The block targeted by deflation is the off-diagonal one since it features a problematic singular value distribution for certain applications. One example is the Stokes flow in elongated channels, where the off-diagonal block has several small, isolated singular values, depending on the length of the channel. Applying deflation to specific parts of the saddle point system is important when using solvers such as CRAIG, which operates on individual blocks rather than the whole system. The theory is developed by extending the existing framework for deflating square matrices before applying a Krylov subspace method like MINRES. Numerical experiments confirm the merits of our strategy and lead to interesting questions about using approximate vectors for deflation.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of adaptive approximations for stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study numerical approximations for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that use adaptive step sizes. In particular, we consider a general setting where decisions to reduce step sizes are allowed to depend on the future trajectory of the underlying Brownian motion. Since these adaptive step sizes may not be previsible, the standard mean squared error analysis cannot be directly applied to show that the numerical method converges to the solution of the SDE. Building upon the pioneering work of Gaines and Lyons, we shall instead use rough path theory to establish convergence for a wide class of adaptive numerical methods on general Stratonovich SDEs (with sufficiently smooth vector fields). To our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee that applies to standard solvers, such as the Milstein and Heun methods, with non-previsible step sizes. In our analysis, we require the sequence of adaptive step sizes to be nested and the SDE solver to have unbiased "L\'evy area" terms in its Taylor expansion. We conjecture that for adaptive SDE solvers more generally, convergence is still possible provided the method does not introduce "L\'evy area bias". We present a simple example where the step size control can skip over previously considered times, resulting in the numerical method converging to an incorrect limit (i.e. not the Stratonovich SDE). Finally, we conclude with an experiment demonstrating the accuracy of Heun's method and a newly introduced Splitting Path-based Runge-Kutta scheme (SPaRK) when used with adaptive step sizes.</description>

      <title>Projected exponential methods for stiff dynamical low-rank approximation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical integration of stiff equations is a challenging problem that needs to be approached by specialized numerical methods. Exponential integrators form a popular class of such methods since they are provably robust to stiffness and have been successfully applied to a variety of problems. The dynamical low- \rank approximation is a recent technique for solving high-dimensional differential equations by means of low-rank approximations. However, the domain is lacking numerical methods for stiff equations since existing methods are either not robust-to-stiffness or have unreasonably large hidden constants. In this paper, we focus on solving large-scale stiff matrix differential equations with a Sylvester-like structure, that admit good low-rank approximations. We propose two new methods that have good convergence properties, small memory footprint and that are fast to compute. The theoretical analysis shows that the new methods have order one and two, respectively. We also propose a practical implementation based on Krylov techniques. The approximation error is analyzed, leading to a priori error bounds and, therefore, a mean for choosing the size of the Krylov space. Numerical experiments are performed on several examples, confirming the theory and showing good speedup in comparison to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>A Meshless Solver for Blood Flow Simulations in Elastic Vessels Using Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating blood flow in the cardiovascular system is crucial for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational approaches offer some non-invasive alternatives to measure blood flow dynamics. Numerical simulations based on traditional methods such as finite-element and other numerical discretizations have been extensively studied and have yielded excellent results. However, adapting these methods to real-life simulations remains a complex task. In this paper, we propose a method that offers flexibility and can efficiently handle real-life simulations. We suggest utilizing the physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in a deformable domain, specifically addressing the simulation of blood flow in elastic vessels. Our approach models blood flow using an incompressible, viscous Navier-Stokes equation in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form. The mechanical model for the vessel wall structure is formulated by an equation of Newton's second law of momentum and linear elasticity to the force exerted by the fluid flow. Our method is a mesh-free approach that eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of the computational domain. This makes it highly efficient in solving simulations involving complex geometries. Additionally, with the availability of well-developed open-source machine learning framework packages and parallel modules, our method can easily be accelerated through GPU computing and parallel computing. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on regular cylinder vessels as well as vessels with plaque on their walls. We compared our results to a solution calculated by Finite Element Methods using a dense grid and small time steps, which we considered as the ground truth solution. We report the relative error and the time consumed to solve the problem, highlighting the advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>A modified version of the PRESB preconditioner for a class of non-Hermitian complex systems of linear equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified version of the PRESB preconditioner for two-by-two block system of linear equations with the coefficient matrix $$\textbf{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
  F &amp; -G^*
  G &amp; F \end{array}\right),$$ where $F\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ is Hermitian positive definite and $G\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ is positive semidefinite. Spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrix is analyzed. In each iteration of a Krylov subspace method, like GMRES, for solving the preconditioned system in conjunction with proposed preconditioner two subsystems with Hermitian positive definite coefficient matrix should be solved which can be accomplished exactly using the Cholesky factorization or inexactly utilizing the conjugate gradient method. Application of the proposed preconditioner to the systems arising from finite element discretization of PDE-constrained optimization problems is presented. Numerical results are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the preconditioner.</description>

      <title>Deep orthogonal decomposition: a continuously adaptive data-driven approach to model order reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel deep learning technique, termed Deep Orthogonal Decomposition (DOD), for dimensionality reduction and reduced order modeling of parameter dependent partial differential equations. The approach consists in the construction of a deep neural network model that approximates the solution manifold through a continuously adaptive local basis. In contrast to global methods, such as Principal Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), the adaptivity allows the DOD to overcome the Kolmogorov barrier, making the approach applicable to a wide spectrum of parametric problems. Furthermore, due to its hybrid linear-nonlinear nature, the DOD can accommodate both intrusive and nonintrusive techniques, providing highly interpretable latent representations and tighter control on error propagation. For this reason, the proposed approach stands out as a valuable alternative to other nonlinear techniques, such as deep autoencoders. The methodology is discussed both theoretically and practically, evaluating its performances on problems featuring nonlinear PDEs, singularities, and parametrized geometries.</description>

      <title>Globally optimal solutions to a class of fractional optimization problems based on proximity gradient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a category of constrained fractional optimization problems that emerge in various practical applications. The objective function for this category is characterized by the ratio of a numerator and denominator, both being convex, semi-algebraic, Lipschitz continuous, and differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradients over the constraint sets. The constrained sets associated with these problems are closed, convex, and semi-algebraic. We propose an efficient algorithm that is inspired by the proximal gradient method, and we provide a thorough convergence analysis. Our algorithm offers several benefits compared to existing methods. It requires only a single proximal gradient operation per iteration, thus avoiding the complicated inner-loop concave maximization usually required. Additionally, our method converges to a critical point without the typical need for a nonnegative numerator, and this critical point becomes a globally optimal solution with an appropriate condition. Our approach is adaptable to unbounded constraint sets as well. Therefore, our approach is viable for many more practical models. Numerical experiments show that our method not only reliably reaches ground-truth solutions in some model problems but also outperforms several existing methods in maximizing the Sharpe ratio with real-world financial data.</description>

      <title>On a finite sum of cosecants appearing in various problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the finite sum of cosecants $\sum\csc\big(\varphi+a\pi l/n\big),$ where the index $l$ runs through 1 to $n-1$ and $\varphi$ and $a$ are arbitrary parameters, as well as several closely related sums, such as similar sums of a series of secants, of tangents and of cotangents. These trigonometric sums appear in various problems in mathematics, physics, and a variety of related disciplines. Their particular cases were fragmentarily considered in previous works, and it was noted that even a simple particular case $\sum\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ does not have a closed-form, i.e. a compact summation formula. In the paper, we derive several alternative representations for the above-mentioned sums, study their properties, relate them to many other finite and infinite sums, obtain their complete asymptotic expansions for large $n$ and provide accurate upper and lower bounds (e.g. the typical relative error for the upper bound is lesser than $2\times10^{-9}$ for $n\geqslant10$ and lesser than $7\times10^{-14}$ for $n\geqslant50$, which is much better than the bounds we could find in previous works). Our researches reveal that these sums are deeply related to several special numbers and functions, especially to the digamma function (furthermore, as a by-product, we obtain several interesting summations formulae for the digamma function). Asymptotical studies show that these sums may have qualitatively different behaviour depending on the choice of $\varphi$ and $a$; in particular, as $n$ increases some of them may become sporadically large. Finally, we also provide several historical remarks related to various sums considered in the paper. We show that some results in the field either were rediscovered several times or can easily be deduced from various known formulae, including some formulae dating back to the XVIIIth century.</description>
