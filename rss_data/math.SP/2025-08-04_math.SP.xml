      <title>Algebraic connectivity in normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic connectivity of a graph $G$ in a finite dimensional real normed linear space $X$ is a geometric counterpart to the Fiedler number of the graph and can be regarded as a measure of the rigidity of the graph in $X$. We analyse the behaviour of the algebraic connectivity of $G$ in $X$ with respect to graph decomposition, vertex deletion and isometric isomorphism, and provide a general bound expressed in terms of the geometry of $X$ and the Fiedler number of the graph. Particular focus is given to the space $\ell_\infty^d$ where we present explicit formulae and calculations as well as upper and lower bounds. As a key tool, we show that the monochrome subgraphs of a complete framework in $\ell_\infty^d$ are odd-hole-free. Connections to redundant rigidity are also presented.</description>

      <title>Long-time evolution of forced waves in the low viscosity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model for internal waves described by a zero order pseudo-differential Hamiltonian $P$ damped by a second order viscosity term $i \nu Q$. Under Morse-Smale or similar weaker global conditions on the classical dynamics, we describe qualitatively the long-time behavior of solutions of the corresponding evolution equation with smooth forcing in a small $\nu$ regime. We show that dissipation effects arise no earlier than at the $t\sim \nu^{-1/3-}$ time scale.</description>

      <title>Perron similarities and the nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is to determine which multisets of complex numbers occur as the spectrum of an entry-wise nonnegative matrix. Although there are some well-known necessary conditions, a solution to the NIEP is far from known. An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Johnson and Paparella developed the theory of real Perron similarities. Here, we fully develop the theory of complex Perron similarities. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone and polytope of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). The extremals of these convex sets are finite in number, and their determination for each Perron similarity would solve the diagonalizable NIEP, a major portion of the entire problem. By considering Perron similarities of certain realizing matrices of Type I Karpelevich arcs, large portions of realizable spectra are generated for a given positive integer. This is demonstrated by producing a nearly complete geometrical representation of the spectra of $4 \times 4$ stochastic matrices. Similar to the Karpelevich region, it is shown that the subset of complex Euclidean space comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices is compact and star-shaped. Extremal elements of the set are defined and shown to be on the boundary. It is shown that the polyhedral cone and convex polytope of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix corresponds to the conical hull and convex hull of its rows, respectively. Similar results are established for multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and multifold Kronecker products of DFT matrices and Walsh matrices. These polytopes are of great significance with respect to the NIEP because they are extremal in the region comprising the spectra of stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Weak coupling asymptotics for the Pauli operator in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute asymptotic expansions for the negative eigenvalues of the Pauli operator in two dimensions perturbed by a weakly coupled potential with definite sign. Whereas previous results were limited to the case of radial magnetic fields and potentials, we are able to drop the assumption of radial symmetry entirely.</description>

      <title>A noncommutative integral on spectrally truncated spectral triples, and a link with quantum ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple approximation of the noncommutative integral in noncommutative geometry for the Connes--Van Suijlekom paradigm of spectrally truncated spectral triples. A close connection between this approximation and the field of quantum ergodicity and work by Widom in particular immediately provides a Szeg\H{o} limit formula for noncommutative geometry. We then make a connection to the density of states. Finally, we propose a definition for the ergodicity of geodesic flow for compact spectral triples. This definition is known in quantum ergodicity as uniqueness of the vacuum state for $C^*$-dynamical systems, and for spectral triples where local Weyl laws hold this implies that the Dirac operator of the spectral triple is quantum ergodic. This brings to light a close connection between quantum ergodicity and Connes' integral formula.</description>
