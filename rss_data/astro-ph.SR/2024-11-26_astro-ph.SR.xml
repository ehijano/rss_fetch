      <title>Chemical Links between a Young M-type T Tauri Star and its Substellar Companion: Spectral Analysis and C/O Measurement of DH Tau A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical abundance measurements of host stars and their substellar companions provide a powerful tool to trace the formation mechanism of the planetary systems. We present a detailed high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of a young M-type star, DH Tau A, which is located in the Taurus molecular cloud belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. This star is host to a low-mass companion, DH Tau b, and both star and the companion are still in their accreting phase. We apply our technique (Hejazi et al. 2024) to measure the abundances of carbon and oxygen using carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules, such as CO and OH, respectively. We determine a near-solar carbon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of C/O=0.555$\pm$0.063 for the host star DH Tau A. We compare this stellar abundance ratio with that of the companion from our previous study (C/O=0.54$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$, Xuan et al. 2024), which also has a near-solar value. This confirms the chemical homogeneity in the DH Tau system, which suggests a formation scenario for the companion consistent with a direct and relatively fast gravitational collapse, rather than a slow core accretion process.</description>

      <title>Triple Evolution Pathways to Black Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries: Insights from V404 Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent discovery shows that V404 Cygni, a prototypical black hole low-mass X-ray binary (BH-LMXB) is a hierarchical triple: the BH and donor star are orbited by a $1.2$ M$_{\odot}$ tertiary at a distance of at least $3500$ au. Motivated by this system, we evolve a grid of $\sim50,000$ triple star systems, spanning a broad range of initial orbits. Our calculations employ {\tt MESA} stellar evolution models, using {\tt POSYDON}, and self-consistently track the effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) oscillations, mass loss, tides, and BH natal kicks. In our simulations, the progenitors of V404 Cygni-like systems have initial outer separations of $1000 - 10000$ au and inner separations of $\sim100$ au, such that they avoid Roche lobe overflow most of the time. Later on, EKL oscillations drive the inner binary to high eccentricities until tides shrink the orbit and mass transfer begins. Notably, such systems only form in simulations with very weak black hole natal kicks ($\lesssim 5\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$) because stronger kicks unbind the tertiaries. Our simulations also predict a population of BH-LMXB triples that form via the classical common-envelope channel, when the BH progenitor does overflow its Roche lobe. The formation rate for this channel is also higher in triples than in isolated binaries because early EKL oscillations cause inner binaries with a wider range of initial separations to enter and survive a common envelope. Our calculations demonstrate that at least some stellar BHs form with extremely weak kicks, and that triple evolution is a significant formation channel for BH-LMXBs.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Long-Period Decayless Oscillations in Short Active Region Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decayless kink oscillations, characterized by their lack of decay in amplitude, have been detected in coronal loops of varying scales in active regions, quiet Sun and coronal holes. Short-period (&lt; 50 s) decayless oscillations have been detected in short loops (&lt; 50 Mm) within active regions. Nevertheless, long-period decayless oscillations in these loops remain relatively unexplored and crucial for understanding the wave modes and excitation mechanisms of decayless oscillations. We present the statistical analysis of decayless oscillations from two active regions observed by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) onboard Solar Orbiter. The average loop length and period of the detected oscillations are 19 Mm and 151 seconds, respectively. We find 82 long-period and 23 short-period oscillations in these loops. We do not obtain a significant correlation between loop length and period. We discuss the possibility of different wave modes in short loops, although standing waves can not be excluded from possible wave modes. Furthermore, a different branch exists for active region short loops in the loop length vs period relation, similar to decayless waves in short loops in quiet Sun and coronal holes. The magnetic fields derived from MHD seismology, based on standing kink modes, show lower values for multiple oscillations compared to previous estimates for long loops in active regions. Additionally, the comparison of period distributions in short loops across different coronal regions indicates that different excitation mechanisms may trigger short-period kink oscillations in active regions compared to the quiet Sun and coronal holes.</description>

      <title>Beryllium: The smoking gun of a rejuvenated star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The chemistry and Galactic velocity components of the star HD 65907 suggest that despite its young isochronal age of $\sim$5 Gyr, it is in fact a merger of two old Population II stars. Its low Li abundance is also consistent with a mass accretion episode. Aims. We determine Li and Be abundances for this star and evaluate its radial velocity time series, activity cycle, and spectral energy distribution in search of clues regarding the origin of this enigmatic star. Methods. Li and Be abundances were determined via spectral synthesis of their resonance lines using HARPS and UVES spectra, respectively. HARPS data were also used to study variations in the star's radial velocity and activity levels. Photometric data were adopted to evaluate the stellar spectral energy distribution. Results. HD 65908 is severely Li- and Be-depleted. Its radial velocity is nearly constant ($\sigma =$ 2 m/s), with a small modulation likely associated with stellar activity, and the star shows no further signs of an undetected close companion. The excess infrared emission is consistent with a 30 K blackbody, which is interpreted as a debris disk surrounding the star. The post-merger mass, rotation rate, and evolution of this star are discussed. Conclusions. The low Li and Be abundances, in addition to the lack of evidence for a companion, are strong pieces of evidence in favor of the stellar merger scenario. In this context, Be can be used to confirm other blue stragglers among field solar-type stars, as proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary disks in post common envelope binary systems with compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a population synthesis study using the binary population synthesis code compas to explore the formation of circumbinary disks (CBDs) following the common envelope evolution (CEE) phase of a giant star and a neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH). We focus on massive binary systems that evolve into double compact object (DCO) binaries after the exposed core of the giant collapses to form a second NS or BH. A CBD around the binary system of the giant's core and the compact object lives for a short time at the termination of the CEE phase and alters the orbital evolution of the binary. We parameterize the conditions for CBD formation in post-CEE binaries and present characteristics of DCO progenitors that are likely or unlikely to form CBDs. We find that CBD formation is most common in BH-BH binaries and NS-NS binaries that are expected to merge within Hubble time. Furthermore, we find that the interaction of the CBD with the core - NS/BH system at the termination of the CEE reduces the expected rate of DCO mergers, regardless of whether these binaries tighten or expand due to this interaction. If the binary system loses angular momentum to the CBD, it may produce a luminous transient due to a merger between the NS/BH and the core of the giant rather than gravitational wave sources. Thus, accounting for post-CEE CBD formation and its interaction with the binary system in population synthesis studies is significant for obtaining reliable predictions of the gravitational wave event rates expected by current detectors.</description>

      <title>Material mixing in pulsar wind nebulae of massive runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we quantitatively examine the manner pulsar wind, supernova ejecta and defunct stellar wind materials distribute and melt together into plerions. We performed 2.5D MHD simulations of the entire evolution of their stellar surroundings and different scenarios are explored, whether the star dies as a red supergiant and Wolf Rayet supernova progenitors, and whether it moved with velocity 20 km/s or 40 km/s through the ISM. Within the post explosion, early 10 kyr, the H burning products rich red supergiant wind only mixes by &lt;= 20 per cent, due to its dense circumstellar medium filling the progenitor bow shock trail, still unaffected by the supernova blastwave. Wolf Rayet materials, enhanced in C, N, O elements, distribute circularly for the 35 Mo star moving at 20 km/s and oblongly at higher velocities, mixing efficiently up to 80 per cent. Supernova ejecta, filled with Mg, Si, Ca, Ti and Fe, remain spherical for longer times at 20 km/s but form complex patterns at higher progenitor speeds due to earlier interaction with the bow shock, in which they mix more efficiently. The pulsar wind mixing is more efficient for Wolf Rayet (25 per cent) than red supergiant progenitors (20 per cent). This work reveals that the past evolution of massive stars and their circumstellar environments critically shapes the internal distribution of chemical elements on plerionic supernova remnants, and, therefore, governs the origin of the various emission mechanisms at work therein. This is essential for interpreting multi-frequency observations of atomic and molecular spectral lines, such as in optical, infrared, and soft X rays.</description>

      <title>Solaris: A Foundation Model of the Sun</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success across various scientific domains, motivating our exploration of their potential in solar physics. In this paper, we present Solaris, the first foundation model for forecasting the Sun's atmosphere. We leverage 13 years of full-disk, multi-wavelength solar imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, spanning a complete solar cycle, to pre-train Solaris for 12-hour interval forecasting. Solaris is built on a large-scale 3D Swin Transformer architecture with 109 million parameters. We demonstrate Solaris' ability to generalize by fine-tuning on a low-data regime using a single wavelength (1700 {\AA}), that was not included in pre-training, outperforming models trained from scratch on this specific wavelength. Our results indicate that Solaris can effectively capture the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere and transform solar forecasting.</description>

      <title>Frozen-field Modeling of Coronal Condensations with MPI-AMRVAC II: Optimization and application in three-dimensional models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frozen-field hydrodynamic (ffHD) model is a simplification of the full magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) equations under the assumption of a rigid magnetic field, which significantly reduces computational complexity and enhances efficiency. In this work, we combine the ffHD prescription with hyperbolic thermal conduction (TC) and the Transition Region Adaptive Conduction (TRAC) method to achieve further optimization. A series of two-dimensional tests are done to evaluate the performance of the hyperbolic TC and the TRAC method. The results indicate that hyperbolic TC, while showing limiter-affected numerical dissipation, delivers outcomes comparable to classic parabolic TC. The TRAC method effectively compensates for the underestimation of enthalpy flux in low-resolution simulations, as evaluated on tests that demonstrate prominence formation. We present an application of the ffHD model that forms a three-dimensional prominence embedded in a magnetic flux rope, which develops into a stable slab-like filament. The simulation reveals a prominence with an elongated spine and a width consistent with observations, highlighting the potential of the ffHD model in capturing the dynamics of solar prominences. Forward modeling of the simulation data produces synthetic images at various wavelengths, providing insights into the appearance of prominences and filaments in different observational contexts. The ffHD model, with its computational efficiency and the demonstrated capability to simulate complex solar phenomena, offers a valuable tool for solar physicists, and is implemented in the open-source MPI-AMRVAC framework.</description>

      <title>Observations of umbral flashes in the resonant sunspot chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sunspot umbrae, the core of some chromospheric lines exhibits periodic brightness enhancements known as umbral flashes. The consensus is that they are produced by the upward propagation of shock waves. This view has recently been challenged by the detection of downflowing umbral flashes and the confirmation of the existence of a resonant cavity above sunspots. We aim to determine waves' propagating or standing nature in the low umbral chromosphere and confirm or refute the existence of downflowing umbral flashes. Spectroscopic temporal series of Ca II 8542 \AA, Ca II H, and Halpha in a sunspot were acquired with the Swedish Solar Telescope. The Halpha velocity was inferred using bisectors. Simultaneous inversions of the Ca II 8542 \AA\ line and the Ca II H core were performed using the NICOLE code. The nature of the oscillations and insights into the resonant oscillatory pattern were determined by analyzing the phase shift between the velocity signals and examining the temporal evolution. Propagating waves in the low chromosphere are more common in regions with frequent umbral flashes, where the transition region is shifted upward, making resonant cavity signatures less noticeable. In contrast, areas with fewer umbral flashes show velocity fluctuations that align with standing oscillations. Evidence suggests dynamic changes in the location of velocity resonant nodes due to variations in transition region height. Downflowing profiles appear at the onset of some umbral flashes, but upflowing motion dominates during most of the flash. These downflowing flashes are more common in standing umbral flashes. We confirm the existence of a chromospheric resonant cavity above sunspot umbrae produced by wave reflections at the transition region. The oscillatory pattern depends on the transition region height, which exhibits spatial and temporal variations due to the impact of the waves.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Shock-associated Energetic Particle Intensities in the Inner Heliosphere: A Proof-of-Concept Capability for the PUNCH Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) associated with shocks driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or shocks developed by corotating interaction regions (CIRs) often extend to high energies, and are thus key elements of space weather. The PUNCH mission, set to be launched in 2025, is equipped with photometric that enables 3D tracking of solar wind structures in the interplanetary space through polarized light. Tracking techniques are used to estimate speeds and speed gradients of solar structures, including speed jumps at fast shocks. We report on a strong and a robust relation between the shock speed jump magnitude at CME and CIR shocks and the peak fluxes of associated energetic particles from the analysis of 59 CME-driven shocks and 74 CIRs observed by Wind/STEP between 1997-2023. We demonstrate that this relation, along with PUNCH anticipated observations of solar structures can be used to forecast shock-associated particle events close to the Sun; thus, advancing and providing a crucial input to forecasting of SEP fluxes in the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Coronal hole picoflare jets are the progenitors of both the fast and the Alfv\'enic slow solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar wind, classified by its bulk speed and the Alfv\'enic nature of its fluctuations, generates the heliosphere. The elusive physical processes responsible for the generation of the different types of the wind are a topic of active debate. Recent observations revealed intermittent jets with kinetic energy in the picoflare range, emerging from dark areas of a polar coronal hole threaded by open magnetic field lines. These could substantially contribute to the solar wind. However, their ubiquity and direct links to the solar wind have not been established. Here we report a unique set of remote-sensing and in-situ observations from the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, that establish a unified picture of the fast and Alfv\'enic slow wind, connected to the similar widespread picoflare jet activity in two coronal holes. Radial expansion of coronal holes ultimately regulates the speed of the emerging wind.</description>

      <title>Interactions between tidal flows and magnetic fields in stellar/planetary convective envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and gaseous planets are magnetised objects but the influence of magnetic fields on their tidal responses and dissipation rates has not been well explored. We present the first exploratory nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of tidally-excited waves in incompressible convective envelopes harbouring an initial dipolar magnetic field. Simulations with weak magnetic fields exhibit tidally-generated differential rotation in the form of zonal flows (like in the purely hydrodynamic case) that can modify tidal dissipation rates from prior linear predictions. Moreover, tidal waves and zonal flows affect the amplitude and structure of the magnetic field, notably through creation of toroidal fields via the $\Omega$-effect. In contrast, simulations with strong magnetic fields feature severely inhibited zonal flows, due to large-scale magnetic stresses, excitation of torsional waves, or magnetic instabilities. We predict that the different regimes observed for weak and strong magnetic fields may be both relevant for low-mass stars when using turbulent values of the magnetic Prandtl number.</description>

Abstract: It has been proposed that if the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, then Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow would have a different luminosity to those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^7$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The $G$ step model (GSM) also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would drastically alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would lead to the helioseismic age of the Sun differing from that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. There is also excellent agreement between the standard expansion history and that traced by cosmic chronometers, but these would disagree severely in the GSM. Moreover, distance indicators that use stellar luminosities would differ drastically beyond 40 Mpc from those that do not. These arguments cast very severe doubt on the viability of the GSM: the solution to the Hubble tension must be sought elsewhere.</description>

      <title>tonalli: an asexual genetic code to characterise APOGEE-2 stellar spectra. I. Validation with synthetic and solar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present tonalli, a spectroscopic analysis python code that efficiently predicts effective temperature, stellar surface gravity, metallicity, $\alpha$-element abundance, and rotational and radial velocities for stars with effective temperatures between 3200 and 6250 K, observed with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2). tonalli implements an asexual genetic algorithm to optimise the finding of the best comparison between a target spectrum and the continuum-normalised synthetic spectra library from the Model Atmospheres with a Radiative and Convective Scheme (MARCS), which is interpolated in each generation. Using simulated observed spectra and the APOGEE-2 solar spectrum of Vesta, we study the performance, limitations, accuracy and precision of our tool. Finally, a Monte Carlo realisation was implemented to estimate the uncertainties of each derived stellar parameter. The ad hoc continuum-normalised library is publicly available on Zenodo (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.12736546).</description>

      <title>Puzzling High-Velocity Calcium Absorption Features Of Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Absorption features Ca II NIR and Ca II H&amp;K of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are characterized by their strong high-velocity features (HVFs). We find that, for these two features of calcium there is a puzzling anti-correlation between the line strengths of HVF and photospheric (PHO) components, and an unexpected positive correlation between the velocity difference and line strength ratio of HVF and PHO components. In comparison, HVFs of Si II $\lambda$6355 and O I $\lambda$7773 show a positive correlation between the line strengths of HVF and PHO components, and no clear correlation between the velocity difference and line strength ratio of the two components. The differences may be associated with the fact that calcium was mostly synthesized in deeper layers than silicon and oxygen, and thus experienced much more serious blocking by substances in outer layers. These observations can shed light on the physics of HVFs.</description>

      <title>Signature of Triaxially Precessing Magnetars in Gamma-ray Burst X-Ray Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray afterglows of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit plateaus, which can be explained by the internal dissipation of a newborn millisecond magnetar wind. In the early phase of these newborn magnetars, the magnetic inclination angle undergoes periodic changes due to precession, leading to periodic modulation of the injection luminosity due to magnetic dipole radiation. This may result in quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) on the plateaus. In this paper, we identify four GRBs with regular flux variations on their X-ray afterglow plateaus from Swift/XRT data before November 2023, three of which exhibit periodicity. Based on the likelihood of supporting a precessing magnetar as the central engine, we classify them into three categories: Gold (GRB 060202 and GRB 180620A), Silver (GRB 050730), and Bronze (GRB 210610A). We invoke a model of magnetic dipole radiation emitted by a triaxially freely precessing magnetar whose spin-down is dominated by electromagnetic radiation, to fit the light curves. Our model successfully reproduces the light curves of these four GRBs, including the regular flux variations on the plateaus and their periodicity (if present). Our work provides further evidence for early precession in newborn millisecond magnetars in GRBs.</description>

      <title>Kalkayotl 2.0 Bayesian phase-space modelling of star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Star-forming regions, stellar associations, and open clusters are fundamental stellar systems where predictions from star-formation theories can be robustly contrasted with observations. Aims: We aim to provide the astrophysical community with a free and open-source code to infer the phase-space (i.e. positions and velocities) parameters of stellar systems with $\lesssim$1000 stars based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry and possibly observed radial velocities. Methods: We upgrade an existing Bayesian hierarchical model and extend it to model 3D (positions) and 6D (positions and velocities) stellar coordinates and system parameters with a flexible variety of statistical models, including a linear velocity field. This velocity field allows for the inference of internal kinematics, including expansion, contraction, and rotation. Results: We extensively validated our statistical models using realistic simulations that mimic the properties of the \textit{Gaia} Data Release 3. We applied \textit{Kalkayotl} to $\beta$-Pictoris, the Hyades, and Praesepe, recovering parameter values compatible with those from the literature. In particular, we found an expansion age of $19.1\pm1.0$ Myr for $\beta$-Pictoris and rotational signal of $32\!\pm\!11\,\rm{m\,s^{-1}\,pc^{-1}}$ for the Hyades and that Praesepe's rotation reported in the literature comes from its periphery. Conclusions: The robust and flexible Bayesian hierarchical model that we make publicly available here represents a step forward in the statistical modelling of stellar systems. The products it delivers, such as expansion, contraction, rotation, and velocity dispersions, can be directly contrasted with predictions from star-formation theories.</description>

      <title>The Frequency and Mass-Ratio Distribution of Binaries in Clusters -- III: Probabilistic Generative Modelling of Six Young Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply probabilistic generative modelling of colour-magnitude diagrams to six young Galactic open star clusters and determine their mass functions, binary mass-ratio distributions, and the frequencies of binary stars. We find that younger clusters tend to exhibit a higher incidence of binaries than their older counterparts. The mass-ratio distribution is fairly flat for the clusters with one exception that exhibits a sharp increase for $q\gtrsim0.9$. The ratio of the number of cluster binaries for which $q&gt;0.75$ to the number of binaries for which $q&gt;0.5$ (referred to as $FQ_{75}$) ranges from $\sim0.4 - 0.8$. This metric increases with the binary-star frequency of a cluster, but declines with cluster age. This may be due to non-ionizing 3-body dynamical processing of a primordial population of close binaries with initial mass ratios, $q \simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>The bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk-metallicity determination of giant exoplanets is essential to constrain their formation and evolution pathways and to compare them to the solar system. Previous studies inferred an inverse relation between the mass and bulk metallicity. However, the data almost exclusively contained planets that orbit FGK stars. The recent discoveries of giant exoplanets around M-dwarf stars present an opportunity to probe whether they follow a mass-metallicity trend different from that of their FGK counterparts. Using evolution models we characterised the interiors of giant exoplanets with reliable mass-radius measurements that orbit FGK and M-dwarf stars. We then inferred the mass-metallicity trends for both populations. We found that the bulk metallicity of giant planets around M stars is overall lower compared to those around FGK stars. This yielded mass-metallicity relations for the two populations with similar slopes but significantly different offsets. The lack of metal-rich giant planets around M dwarfs could explain the difference in the inferred offset and be a result of different formation conditions. However, there were only 20 successful bulk-metallicity retrievals for the giant planets around M dwarfs, which resulted in rather large uncertainties. Therefore, it is of great importance to continue detecting these planets with both transit and radial velocities. Additionally, the characterisation of the atmospheres of giant planets around M-stars can further help to constrain their interiors and to investigate the atmosp</description>

      <title>Non-linear saturation and energy transport in global simulations of magneto-thermal turbulence in the stratified intracluster medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The magneto-thermal instability (MTI) is one of many possible drivers of stratified turbulence in the intracluster medium (ICM) outskirts of galaxy clusters, where the background temperature gradient is aligned with the gravity. This instability occurs because of the fast anisotropic conduction of heat along magnetic field lines; but to what extent it impacts the ICM dynamics, energetics and overall equilibrium is still a matter of debate. Aims. This work aims at understanding MTI turbulence in an astrophysically stratified ICM atmosphere, its saturation mechanism, and its ability to carry energy and to provide non-thermal pressure support. Methods. We perform a series of 2D and 3D numerical simulations of the MTI in global spherical models of stratified ICM, thanks to the finite-volume code IDEFIX, using Braginskii-magnetohydrodynamics. We use volume-, shell-averaged and spectral diagnostics to study the saturation mechanism of the MTI, and its radial transport energy budget. Results. The MTI is found to saturate through a dominant balance between injection and dissipation of available potential energy, which amounts to marginalising the Braginskii heat flux but not the background temperature gradient itself. Accordingly, the strength and injection length of MTI-driven turbulence exhibit clear dependencies on the thermal diffusivity. The MTI drives cluster-size motions with Mach numbers up to $\mathcal{M} \sim 0.3$, even in presence of strong stable entropy stratification. We show that such mildly compressible flows can provide about $\sim 15\%$ of non-thermal pressure support in the outermost ICM regions, and that the convective transport itself is much less efficient than conduction at radially transporting energy. Finally, we show that the MTI saturation can be described by a diffusive mixing-length theory, shedding light on the diffusive buoyant nature of the instability.</description>

      <title>Interaction between the Supernova Remnant W44 and the Infrared Dark Cloud G034.77-00.55: shock induced star formation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How Supernova Remnant (SNR) shocks impact nearby molecular clouds is still poorly observationally constrained. It is unclear if SNRs can positively or negatively affect clouds star formation potential. We have studied the dense gas morphology and kinematics toward the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G034.77-00.55, shock-interacting with the SNR W44, to identify evidence of early stage star formation induced by the shock. We have used high-angular resolution N2H+(1-0) images across G034.77-00.55, obtained with ALMA. N2H+ is a well known tracer of dense and cold material, optimal to identify gas with the highest potential to harbour star formation. The N2H+ emission is distributed into two elongated structures, one toward the dense ridge at the edge of the source and one toward the inner cloud. Both elongations are spatially associated with well-defined mass-surface density features. The velocities of the gas in the two structures i.e., 38-41 km s-1 and 41-43 km s-1 are consistent with the lowest velocities of the J- and C-type parts of the SNR-driven shock, respectively. A third velocity component is present at 43-45.5 km s-1. The dense gas shows a fragmented morphology with core-like fragments of scales consistent with the Jeans lengths, masses $\sim$1-20 M$_{\odot}$, densities (n(H$_2$)$\geq$10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$) sufficient to host star formation in free-fall time scales (few 10$^4$ yr) and with virial parameters that hint toward possible collapse. The W44 driven shock may have swept up the encountered material which is now seen as a dense ridge, almost detached from the main cloud, and an elongation within the inner cloud, well constrained in both N2H+ emission and mass surface density. This shock compressed material may have then fragmented into cores that are either in a starless or pre-stellar stage. Additional observations are needed to confirm this scenario and the nature of the cores.</description>

      <title>The JWST Weather Report from the Isolated Exoplanet Analog SIMP 0136+0933: Pressure-Dependent Variability Driven by Multiple Mechanisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isolated planetary-mass objects share their mass range with planets but do not orbit a star. They lack the necessary mass to support fusion in their cores and thermally radiate their heat from formation as they cool, primarily at infrared wavelengths. Many isolated planetary-mass objects show variations in their infrared brightness consistent with non-uniform atmospheric features modulated by their rotation. SIMP J013656.5+093347.3 is a rapidly rotating isolated planetary-mass object, and previous infrared monitoring suggests complex atmospheric features rotating in and out of view. The physical nature of these features is not well understood, with clouds, temperature variations, thermochemical instabilities, and infrared-emitting aurora all proposed as contributing mechanisms. Here we report JWST time-resolved low-resolution spectroscopy from 0.8 - 11 micron of SIMP J013656.5+093347.3 which supports the presence of three specific features in the atmosphere: clouds, hot spots, and changing carbon chemistry. We show that no single mechanism can explain the variations in the time-resolved spectra. When combined with previous studies of this object indicating patchy clouds and aurorae, these measurements reveal the rich complexity of the atmosphere of SIMP J013656.5+093347.3. Gas giant planets in the solar system, specifically Jupiter and Saturn, also have multiple cloud layers and high-altitude hot spots, suggesting these phenomena are also present in worlds both within and beyond our solar-system.</description>

      <title>Once a Triple, Not Always a Triple: The Evolution of Hierarchical Triples that Yield Merged Inner Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than half of all main-sequence (MS) stars have one or more companions, and many of those with initial masses &lt;8 M$_\odot$ are born in hierarchical triples. These systems feature two stars in a close orbit (the inner binary) while a tertiary star orbits them on a wider orbit (the outer binary). In hierarchical triples, three-body dynamics combined with stellar evolution drives interactions and, in many cases, merges the inner binary entirely to create a renovated `Post-Merger Binary' (PMB). By leveraging dynamical simulations and tracking binary interactions, we explore the outcomes of merged triples and investigate whether PMBs preserve signatures of their three-body history. Our findings indicate that in 26-54% of wide double WD binaries (s&gt;100 au), the more massive white dwarf (WD) is a merger product, implying that these DWD binaries were previously triples. Overall, we estimate that $44\pm14\%$ of observed wide DWDs originated in triple star systems and thereby have rich dynamical histories. Additionally, our results suggest that the separations of inner and outer binaries are uncorrelated at birth, providing insights into stellar formation processes. We also examine MS+MS and MS+Red Giant mergers manifesting as Blue Straggler stars (BSSs). These PMBs have orbital configurations and ages similar to most observed BSS binaries. While the triple+merger formation channel can explain the observed chemical abundances, moderate eccentricities, and companion masses in BSS binaries, it likely only accounts for $\sim$20-25% of BSSs. Meanwhile, we predict that the majority of observed single BSSs formed as collisions in triples and harbor long-period (&gt;10 yr) companions. Furthermore, both BSS binaries and DWDs exhibit signatures of WD birth kicks.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Robust Stellar Rotation Periods catalog for 82771 Kepler stars using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new framework to predict stellar properties from light curves. We analyze the light-curve data from the Kepler space mission and develop a novel tool for deriving the stellar rotation periods for main-sequence stars. Using this tool, we provide rotation periods for more than 80K stars. Our model, LightPred, is a novel deep-learning model designed to extract stellar rotation periods from light curves. The model utilizes a dual-branch architecture combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer components to capture temporal and global data features. We train LightPred on self-supervised contrastive pre-training and simulated light curves generated using a realistic spot model. Our evaluation demonstrates that LightPred outperforms classical methods like the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) in terms of accuracy and average error. We apply LightPred to the Kepler dataset, generating the largest catalog to date. Using error analysis based on learned confidence and consistency metric, we were able to filter the predictions and remove stellar types with variability which is different than spot-induced variability. Our analysis shows strong correlations between error levels and stellar parameters. Additionally, we confirm tidal synchronization in eclipsing binaries with orbital periods shorter than 10 days. Our findings highlight the potential of deep learning in extracting fundamental stellar properties from light curves, opening new avenues for understanding stellar evolution and population demographics.</description>

      <title>A 2.9-hour periodic radio transient with an optical counterpart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a long-period radio transient (GLEAM-X J0704-37) discovered to have an optical counterpart, consistent with a cool main sequence star of spectral type M3. The radio pulsations occur at the longest period yet found, 2.9 hours, and were discovered in archival low-frequency data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). High time resolution observations from MeerKAT show that pulsations from the source display complex microstructure and high linear polarisation, suggesting a pulsar-like emission mechanism occurring due to strong, ordered magnetic fields. The timing residuals, measured over more than a decade, show tentative evidence of a ~6-yr modulation. The high Galactic latitude of the system and the M-dwarf star excludes a magnetar interpretation, suggesting a more likely M-dwarf / white dwarf binary scenario for this system.</description>

      <title>Hertzsprung gap stars in nearby galaxies and the Quest for Luminous Red Novae Progenitors</title>

Abstract: After the main sequence phase, stars more massive than 2.5 M$_\odot$ rapidly evolve through the Hertzsprung gap as yellow giants and supergiants (YSG), before settling into the red giant branch. Identifying YSG in nearby galaxies is crucial for pinpointing progenitors of luminous red novae (LRNe) - astrophysical transients attributed to stellar mergers. In the era of extensive transient surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's LSST, this approach offers a new way to predict and select common envelope transients. This study investigates potential progenitors and precursors of LRNe by analysing Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of stellar populations in galaxies within 20 Mpc to identify YSG candidates. Additionally, we use ZTF and MeerLICHT/BlackGEM to identify possible precursors, preparing for future observations by the LSST. We compiled a sample of 369 galaxies with HST exposures in the F475W, F555W, F606W, and F814W filters. We identified YSG candidates using MESA stellar evolution tracks and statistical analysis of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). Our sample includes 154,494 YSG candidates with masses between 3 and 20 $M_\odot$ and is affected by various contaminants, such as foreground stars and extinguished main-sequence stars. After excluding foreground stars using Gaia proper motions, contamination is estimated at 1\% from foreground stars and 20\% from extinction affecting main-sequence stars. Combining our YSG candidates with time-domain catalogs yielded several interesting candidates. Notably, we identified 12 LRN precursor candidates for which followup is encouraged. We highlight the importance of monitoring future transients that match YSG candidates to avoid missing potential LRNe and other rare transients. LSST will be a game changer in the search for LRN progenitors and precursors, discovering over 300,000 new YSG and 100 precursors within 20 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Properties of Solar Super Active Region 13664 in the Context of the Historic Geomagnetic Storm of 2024 May 10-11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of solar-stellar activity on planetary environments is a topic of great interest within the Sun-Earth system as well as exoplanetary systems. In particular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a profound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active region on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of Earth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated mass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was the strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these flares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical characteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system is related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive super active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their salient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical context over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664 stands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June, and at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period 1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic properties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010 May-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid rate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it spawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR 13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating their flare-relevant physical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Identifying Spicules in Mg II: Statistics and Comparisons with H{\alpha}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sun's chromosphere is a critical region to understand when considering energy and mass deposition into the transition region and corona, but many of the smaller, faster events which transport a portion of this mass and energy are still difficult to observe, identify and model. Solar Spicules are small, spike-like events in the solar chromosphere that have the potential to transfer energy and mass to the transition region, but whose energetic origins are still being researched. Chromospheric spicule activity on-disk can be identified by observing temporary excursions in the red and blue wings of chromospheric emission lines. Researchers have demonstrated this in Hydrogen~Alpha (H{\alpha}, 6563 {\AA}), Ca II (8542 {\AA}, k 3934 {\AA}), Mg II (h 2803 {\AA}, k 2796 {\AA}), and Si IV (1394 {\AA}, 1405 {\AA}) spectral observations, with the vast majority of identification efforts focused on lower chromospheric observations of H$\alpha$ and Ca II. Because any spicules which deposit mass and energy into the transition region must necessarily pass through the upper chromosphere, observations from this region such as Mg II or Hydrogen Lyman Alpha (Ly$\alpha$ 1216 {\AA}) in enough quantity to perform proper statistics will be critical to fully characterizing spicules' impact on mass and energy transfer in the Sun. This research proposes a definition with numerical limits for how spicules appear in Mg II wavelengths, tunes an algorithm for automatically detecting spicules in Mg II spectral observations, and uses K Means Clustering to identify and display the full range of spicule spectrum shapes. This work will help allow statistical studies on spicules in the upper chromosphere to be as thorough as those of the lower chromosphere, allowing researchers to better understand the physical nature of spicules and their role in energy transfer and deposition in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Protosolar D-to-H abundance and one part-per-billion PH$_{3}$ in the coldest brown dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14541</link>

Abstract: The coldest Y spectral type brown dwarfs are similar in mass and temperature to cool and warm ($\sim$200 -- 400 K) giant exoplanets. We can therefore use their atmospheres as proxies for planetary atmospheres, testing our understanding of physics and chemistry for these complex, cool worlds. At these cold temperatures, their atmospheres are cold enough for water clouds to form, and chemical timescales increase, increasing the likelihood of disequilibrium chemistry compared to warmer classes of planets. JWST observations are revolutionizing the characterization of these worlds with high signal-to-noise, moderate resolution near- and mid-infrared spectra. The spectra have been used to measure the abundances of prominent species like water, methane, and ammonia; species that trace chemical reactions like carbon monoxide; and even isotopologues of carbon monoxide and ammonia. Here, we present atmospheric retrieval results using both published fixed-slit (GTO program 1230) and new averaged time series observations (GO program 2327) of the coldest known Y dwarf, WISE 0855-0714 (using NIRSpec G395M spectra), which has an effective temperature of $\sim$ 264 K. We present a detection of deuterium in an atmosphere outside of the solar system via a relative measurement of deuterated methane (CH$_{3}$D) and standard methane. From this, we infer the D/H ratio of a substellar object outside the solar system for the first time. We also present a well-constrained part-per-billion abundance of phosphine (PH$_{3}$). We discuss our interpretation of these results and the implications for brown dwarf and giant exoplanet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>AtomNeb: IDL Library and Python Package for Atomic Data of Ionized Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.02528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectra emitted from ionized nebulae typically contain collisionally excited and recombination lines, which can be used to trace physical conditions and chemical abundances of the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and other galaxies. "AtomNeb" is a database containing atomic data stored in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) file format, including the data for collisionally excited and recombination lines often observed in nebular astrophysics. The AtomNeb interface library is equipped with several application programming interface (API) functions developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), also usable in the GNU Data Language (GDL), and in the high-level, general-purpose programming language Python. The IDL library relies on the FITS file-related IDL procedures from the IDL Astronomy User's library, while the Python package depends on the Python packages Astropy and NumPy. The AtomNeb IDL library and the corresponding Python package, in conjunction with the "proEQUIB" IDL library and "pyEQUIB" Python package, respectively, can be used to perform plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of emission lines from ionized gaseous nebulae.</description>

      <title>First Indication of Solar $^8$B Neutrinos via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering with XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of nuclear recoils from solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering with the XENONnT dark matter experiment. The central detector of XENONnT is a low-background, two-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9 t sensitive liquid xenon target. A blind analysis with an exposure of 3.51 t$\times$yr resulted in 37 observed events above 0.5 keV, with ($26.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$) events expected from backgrounds. The background-only hypothesis is rejected with a statistical significance of 2.73 $\sigma$. The measured $^8$B solar neutrino flux of $(4.7_{-2.3}^{+3.6})\times 10^6 \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is consistent with results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The measured neutrino flux-weighted CE$\nu$NS cross section on Xe of $(1.1^{+0.8}_{-0.5})\times10^{-39} \mathrm{cm}^2$ is consistent with the Standard Model prediction. This is the first direct measurement of nuclear recoils from solar neutrinos with a dark matter detector.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>
