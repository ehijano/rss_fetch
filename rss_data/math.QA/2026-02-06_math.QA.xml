      <title>Quantum cluster algebra, braid moves and quantum virtual Grothendieck ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum virtual Grothendieck ring, denoted by $\frakK_q(\g)$, which was introduced in [39], and further investigated in [26, 25]. Our approach involves examining this ring from two perspectives: first, by considering its connection to quantum cluster algebras of non-skew-symmetric types; and second, by exploring its relevance to categorification theory. We specifically focus on (i) the homomorphisms that arise from braid moves, particularly 4-moves and 6-moves, in the braid group; and (ii) the quantum Laurent positivity phenomena, which has not yet been proven for non-skew-symmetric types.
  As applications of our results, we derive the substitution formulas for non-skew-symmetric types discussed in [11] for skew-symmetric types, and demonstrate that any truncated element in a heart subring, denoted by $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$, which corresponds to a simple module over the quiver Hecke algebra $R^\g$, possesses coefficients in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$. This result is particularly interesting because it implies that each truncated Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomial in $\frakK_{q,Q}(\g)$ and each element in the standard basis $\sfE_q(\g)$ of the entire ring $\frakK_q(\g)$ have coefficients also in $\Z_{\ge 0}[q^{\pm 1/2}]$.
  Since (truncated) Kirillov--Reshetikhin polynomials can be obtained using a quantum cluster algebra algorithm and appear as quantum cluster variables, they provide compelling evidence in support of the quantum Laurent positivity conjecture in non-skew-symmetric types.</description>

      <title>Duality in Monoidal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare closed and rigid monoidal categories. Closedness is defined by the tensor product having a right adjoint: the internal hom functor. Rigidity, on the other hand, generalises the duality of finite-dimensional vector spaces. In the latter, the internal hom functor is implemented by tensoring with the respective duals. This raises the question: can one decide whether a closed monoidal category is rigid, simply by verifying that the internal hom is tensor-representable? We provide a counterexample in terms of the category of sl2-crystals. As a byproduct, we obtain characterisations of the Grothendieck-Verdier duality and rigidity of functor categories endowed with Day convolution as their tensor product. This has various applications, three of which we study in detail: generalisations of quasi-Frobenius algebras, called QF-2 algebras; Mackey functors, where we prove that, as expected due to work of Bouc, an object being rigidly dualisable is equivalent to it being finitely-generated projective; and crossed modules of finite groups, where we associate to each of these objects a Grothendieck-Verdier category of group-graded representations.</description>

      <title>Commuting Subalgebras of Affine Super Yangians Arising from Edge Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed two kinds of edge contractions for the affine super Yangian and a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to the universal enveloping algebra of a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$. In this article, we show that these two edge contractions commute with each other. As an application, we give a homomorphism from the affine super Yangian to some centralizer algebras of the universal enveloping algebra of $W$-superalgebras of type $A$. Using the edge contraction, we also show the compatibility of the coproduct for the affine super Yangian with the parabolic induction for a $W$-superalgebra of type $A$ in some special cases.</description>
