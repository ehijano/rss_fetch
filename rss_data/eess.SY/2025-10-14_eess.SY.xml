      <title>Sequential Convex Programming for 6-DoF Powered Descent Guidance with Continuous-Time Compound State-Triggered Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) framework for ensuring the continuous-time satisfaction of compound state-triggered constraints, a subset of logical specifications, in the powered descent guidance (PDG) problem. The proposed framework combines the generalized mean-based smooth robustness measure (D-GMSR), a parameterization technique tailored for expressing discrete-time temporal and logical specifications through smooth functions, with the continuous-time successive convexification (CT-SCvx) method, a real-time solution for constrained trajectory optimization that guarantees continuous-time constraint satisfaction and convergence. The smoothness of the temporal and logical specifications parameterized via D-GMSR enables solving the resulting optimization problem with robust and efficient SCP algorithms while preserving theoretical guarantees. In addition to their smoothness, the parameterized specifications are sound and complete, meaning the specification holds if and only if the constraint defined by the parameterized function is satisfied. The CT-SCvx framework is then applied to solve the parameterized problem, incorporating: (1) reformulation for continuous-time path constraint satisfaction, (2) time-dilation to transform the free-final-time PDG problem into a fixed-final-time problem, (3) multiple shooting for exact discretization, (4) exact penalty functions for penalizing nonconvex constraints, and (5) the prox-linear method, a convergence-guaranteed SCP algorithm, to solve the resulting finite-dimensional nonconvex PDG problem. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a numerical simulation. The implementation is available at https://github.com/UW-ACL/CT-cSTC</description>

      <title>Designing Control Barrier Functions Using a Dynamic Backup Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach to construct control barrier functions for nonlinear control affine systems subject to arbitrary state and input constraints. Taking inspiration from the reference governor literature, the proposed method defines a family of backup policies, parametrized by the equilibrium manifold of the system. The control barrier function is defined on the augmented state-and-reference space: given a state-reference pair, the approach quantifies the distance to constraint violation at any time in the future, should the current backup policy reference remain constant. Sensitivity analysis is then used to compute the (possibly nonsmooth) Jacobian with respect to the augmented state vector. To showcase its simple yet general nature, the proposed method is applied to an inverted pendulum on cart.</description>

      <title>Latent-Feature-Informed Neural ODE Modeling for Lightweight Stability Evaluation of Black-box Grid-Tied Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability evaluation of black-box grid-tied inverters is vital for grid reliability, yet identification techniques are both data-hungry and blocked by proprietary internals. {To solve this, this letter proposes a latent-feature-informed neural ordinary differential equation (LFI-NODE) modeling method that can achieve lightweight stability evaluation directly from trajectory data.} LFI-NODE parameterizes the entire system ODE with a single continuous-time neural network, allowing each new sample to refine a unified global model. It faithfully captures nonlinear large-signal dynamics to preserve uniform predictive accuracy as the inverter transitions between operating points. Meanwhile, latent perturbation features distilled from every trajectory steer the learning process and concurrently reveal the small-signal eigenstructure essential for rigorous stability analysis. Validated on a grid-forming inverter, {The LFI-NODE requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer training samples compared with traditional methods, collected from short time-domain trajectories instead of extensive frequency-domain measurements.} {Furthermore, the LFI-NODE requires only 48 short transients to achieve a trajectory prediction error at the hundredth level and an eigenvalue estimation error at the tenth level, outperforming benchmark methods by one to two orders of magnitude.} This makes LFI-NODE a practical and lightweight approach for achieving high-fidelity stability assessment of complex black-box power-electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Cyber-Physical Systems on the Megawatt Scale: The impact of battery control on grid frequency stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric power systems are undergoing fundamental change. The shift to inverter-based generation challenges frequency stability, while growing digitalisation heightens vulnerability to errors and attacks. Here we identify an emerging risk at the intersection of cyber-physical coupling and control system design. We show that grid frequency time series worldwide exhibit a persistent one-minute oscillatory pattern, whose origin has remained largely unexplained. We trace this pattern back to the energy management systems of battery electric storage systems and demonstrate that the pattern amplitude has increased substantially in the Nordic and British grids. We argue that this effect is a potential burden for stability in future grids with low inertia and an increasing penetration with batteries and smart devices, though it can be mitigated by a revision of battery control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Computing Safe Control Inputs using Discrete-Time Matrix Control Barrier Functions via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have seen widespread success in providing forward invariance and safety guarantees for dynamical control systems. A crucial limitation of discrete-time formulations is that CBFs that are nonconcave in their argument require the solution of nonconvex optimization problems to compute safety-preserving control inputs, which inhibits real-time computation of control inputs guaranteeing forward invariance. This paper presents a novel method for computing safety-preserving control inputs for discrete-time systems with nonconvex safety sets, utilizing convex optimization and the recently developed class of matrix control barrier function techniques. The efficacy of our methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations on a bicopter system.</description>

      <title>Viscosity CBFs: Bridging the Control Barrier Function and Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Frameworks in Safe Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) and Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) are central frameworks in safe control. Traditionally, these frameworks have been viewed as distinct, with the former focusing on optimally safe controller design and the latter providing sufficient conditions for safety. A previous work introduced the notion of a control barrier value function (CB-VF), which is defined similarly to the other value functions studied in HJR but has certain CBF-like properties. In this work, we proceed the other direction by generalizing CBFs to non-differentiable ``viscosity'' CBFs. We show the deep connection between viscosity CBFs and CB-VFs, bridging the CBF and HJR frameworks. Through this bridge, we characterize the viscosity CBFs as precisely those functions which provide CBF-like safety guarantees (control invariance and smooth approach to the boundary). We then further show nice theoretical properties of viscosity CBFs, including their desirable closure under maximum and limit operations. In the process, we also extend CB-VFs to non-exponential anti-discounting and update the corresponding theory for CB-VFs along these lines.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Communication and Human Uncertainties on Runway Capacity in Terminal Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential impact of communication and human performance uncertainties on runway operations. Specifically, we consider these impacts within the context of an arrival scenario with two converging flows: a straight-in approach stream and a downwind stream merging into it. Both arrival stream are modeled using a modified Possion distribution that incorporate the separation minima as well as the runway occupancy time. Various system level uncertainties are addressed in this process, including communication link- and human-related uncertainties. In this research, we first build a Monte Carlo-based discrete-time simulation, where aircraft arrivals are generated by modified Poisson processes subject to minimum separation constraints, simulating various traffic operations. The merging logic incorporates standard bank angle continuous turn-to-final, pilot response delays, and dynamic gap availability in real time. Then, we investigate an automated final approach vectoring model (i.e., Auto-ATC), in which inverse optimal control is used to learn decision advisories from human expert records. By augmenting trajectories and incorporating the aforementioned uncertainties into the planning scenario, we create a setup analogous to the discrete event simulation. For both studies, runway capacity is measured by runway throughput, the fraction of downwind arrivals that merge immediately without holding, and the average delay (i.e., holding time/distance) experienced on the downwind leg. This research provides a method for runway capacity estimation in merging scenarios, and demonstrates that aeronautical communication link uncertainties significantly affect runway capacity in current voice-based operations, whereas the impact can be mitigated in autonomous operational settings.</description>

      <title>Performance Index Shaping for Closed-loop Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of the performance index, also referred to as cost or reward shaping, is central to both optimal control and reinforcement learning, as it directly determines the behaviors, trade-offs, and objectives that the resulting control laws seek to achieve. A commonly used approach for this inference task in recent years is differentiable trajectory optimization, which allows gradients to be computed with respect to cost parameters by differentiating through an optimal control solver. However, this method often requires repeated solving of the underlying optimal control problem at every iteration, making the method computationally expensive. In this work, assuming known dynamics, we propose a novel framework that analytically links the performance index to the resulting closed-loop optimal control law, thereby transforming a typically bi-level inverse problem into a tractable single-level formulation. Our approach is motivated by the question: given a closed-loop control law that solves an infinite-horizon optimal control problem, how does this law change when the performance index is modified with additional terms? This formulation yields closed-form characterizations for broad classes of systems and performance indices, which not only facilitate interpretation and stability analysis, but also provide insight into the robust stability and input-to-state stable behavior of the resulting nonlinear closed-loop system. Moreover, this analytical perspective enables the generalization of our approach to diverse design objectives, yielding a unifying framework for performance index shaping. Given specific design objectives, we propose a systematic methodology to guide the shaping of the performance index and thereby design the resulting optimal control law.</description>

      <title>Bounds of Validity for Bifurcations of Equilibria in a Class of Networked Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local bifurcation analysis plays a central role in understanding qualitative transitions in networked nonlinear dynamical systems, including dynamic neural network and opinion dynamics models. In this article we establish explicit bounds of validity for the classification of bifurcation diagrams in two classes of continuous-time networked dynamical systems, analogous in structure to the Hopfield and the Firing Rate dynamic neural network models. Our approach leverages recent advances in computing the bounds for the validity of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, a reduction method widely employed in nonlinear systems analysis. Using these bounds we rigorously characterize neighborhoods around bifurcation points where predictions from reduced-order models remain reliable. We further demonstrate how these bounds can be applied to an illustrative family of nonlinear opinion dynamics on k-regular graphs, which emerges as a special case of the general framework. These results provide new analytical tools for quantifying the robustness of bifurcation phenomena in dynamics over networked systems and highlight the interplay between network structure and nonlinear dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>Optimal monophasic, asymmetric electric field pulses for selective transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with minimised power and coil heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with asymmetric electric field pulses, such as monophasic, offers directional selectivity for neural activation but requires excessive energy. Previous pulse shape optimisation has been limited to symmetric pulses or heavily constrained variations of conventional waveforms without achieving general optimality in energy efficiency or neural selectivity. We implemented an optimisation framework that incorporates neuron model activation constraints and flexible control of pulse asymmetry. The optimised electric field waveforms achieved up to 92 % and 88 % reduction in energy loss and thus coil heating respectively compared to conventional monophasic pulses and previously improved monophasic-equivalent pulses. In the human experiments, OUR pulses showed similar motor thresholds to monophasic pulses in both AP and PA directions with significantly lower energy loss, particularly in the AP direction. Moreover, there was a significant MEP latency difference of (1.79 +/- 0.41) ms between AP and PA direction with OUR pulses, which suggests directional selectivity. Our framework successfully identified highly energy-efficient asymmetric pulses for directionally-selective neural engagement. These pulses can enable selective rapid-rate repetitive TMS protocols with reduced power consumption and coil heating, with potential benefits for precision and potency of neuro-modulation.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Pyranometer-Based ANN Approach for MPPT in Solar PV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a study on the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in photovoltaic (PV) systems using low-cost pyranometer sensors. The proposed approach integrates pyranometers, temperature sensors, and an ANN to estimate the duty cycle of a DC/DC converter, enabling the system to consistently operate at its maximum power point. The strategy was implemented in the local control of a Cuk converter and experimentally validated against the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&amp;O) method. Results demonstrate that the ANN-based technique, leveraging affordable sensor technology, achieves accurate MPPT performance with reduced fluctuations, enhancing the responsiveness and efficiency of PV tracking systems.</description>

      <title>Discovering interpretable piecewise nonlinear model predictive control laws via symbolic decision trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose symbolic decision trees as surrogate models for approximating model predictive control laws. The proposed approach learns simultaneously the partition of the input domain (splitting logic) as well as local nonlinear expressions for predicting the control action leading to interpretable piecewise nonlinear control laws. The local nonlinear expressions are determined by the learning problem and are modeled using a set of basis functions. The learning task is posed as a mixed integer optimization, which is solved to global optimality with state-of-the-art global optimization solvers. We apply the proposed approach to a case study regarding the control of an isothermal reactor. The results show that the proposed approach can learn the control law accurately, leading to closed-loop performance comparable to that of a standard model predictive controller. Finally, comparison with existing interpretable models shows that the symbolic trees achieve both lower prediction error and superior closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Risk-Budgeted Control Framework for Balanced Performance and Safety in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a risk-budgeted monitor with a control framework that certifies safety for autonomous driving. In this process, a sliding window is proposed to monitor for insufficient barrier residuals or nonzero tail risk, ensuring system safety. When the safety margin deteriorates, it triggers switching the safety constraint from a performance-based relaxed-control barrier function (R-CBF) to a conservative conditional value at risk (CVaR-CBF) to address the safety concern. This switching is governed by two real-time triggers: Feasibility-Triggered (FT) and Quality-Triggered (QT) conditions. In the FT condition, if the R-CBF constraint becomes infeasible or yields a suboptimal solution, the risk monitor triggers the use of the CVaR constraints for the controller. In the QT condition, the risk monitor observes the safety margin of the R-CBF solution at every step, regardless of feasibility. If it falls below the safety margin, the safety filter switches to the CVaR-CBF constraints.
  The proposed framework is evaluated using a model predictive controller (MPC) for autonomous driving in the presence of autonomous vehicle (AV) localization noise and obstacle position uncertainties. Multiple AV-pedestrian interaction scenarios are considered, with 1,500 Monte Carlo runs conducted for all scenarios. In the most challenging setting with pedestrian detection uncertainty of 5 m, the proposed framework achieves a 94-96% success rate of not colliding with the pedestrians over 300 trials while maintaining the lowest mean cross-track error (CTE = 3.2-3.6 m) to the reference path. The reduced CTE indicates faster trajectory recovery after obstacle avoidance, demonstrating a balance between safety and performance.</description>

      <title>Controller for Incremental Input-to-State Practical Stabilization of Partially Unknown systems with Invariance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental stability is a property of dynamical systems that ensures the convergence of trajectories with respect to each other rather than a fixed equilibrium point or a fixed trajectory. In this paper, we introduce a related stability notion called incremental input-to-state practical stability ({\delta}-ISpS), ensuring safety guarantees. We also present a feedback linearization based control design scheme that renders a partially unknown system incrementally input-to-state practically stable and safe with formal guarantees. To deal with the unknown dynamics, we utilize Gaussian process regression to approximate the model. Finally, we implement the controller synthesized by the proposed scheme on a manipulator example</description>

It aimed to transform the Tarlac State University Gymnasium into a facility with energy-efficient equipment to contribute to reducing carbon footprints by integrating a solar PV system as its renewable energy source. The researchers found out that the electrical infrastructure of the Gym was outdated, and the lighting was not energy efficient, and there were too few convenience or power outlets. There was also insufficient cooling equipment to maintain a comfortable temperature. Analysis shows that the payback period is within the average range, making it a cost-effective investment for the University. Aside from the cost of the PV System, adherence to engineering design standards will mean additional costs to replace the metal halides with LED high bay lamps, installation of additional air conditioning units, and provision of additional convenience outlets. These additional costs should be considered when evaluating the feasibility of the project. It is recommended that the integrity of the existing roof system of the Gymnasium be considered. The total cost of putting up the whole electrical system, including new lighting, cooling, and convenience loads, must be calculated to determine the total cost of implementing the whole NZEB project. Other factors in the economic evaluation may be considered to determine a more stringent result.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Modeling of Air-Conditioner Loads Under Packet-based Control with Both On and Off Grid Access Requests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10651</link>

Abstract: Coordination of distributed energy resources (DERs) can engender flexibility necessary to improve grid reliability. Packetized Energy Management (PEM) is a method for coordinating DERs, such as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) and electric vehicles, within customer quality-of-service (QoS) limits. In PEM, a DER uses local information to offer flexibility by sending a request to the DER coordinator to turn-ON or turn-OFF. Much work has focused on modeling and analyzing aggregations of DERs under PEM with fixed packet durations and only turn-ON requests. Different recent efforts to enable variable packet lengths have shown an increase in available flexibility and ramping capability, but have not been modeled in aggregate, which limits systematic analyses. To address this issue, this paper presents a new aggregate bin-based (macro) model of PEM loads that incorporates both turn-ON and turn-OFF request features, enabling the model to accurately characterize the capability of the fleet of DERs to track a power reference signal, population temperature dynamics, aggregate request rates, and variable packet lengths. Simulation-based validation is performed against an agent-based (micro) model to evaluate robustness and quantify model accuracy. Finally, the distribution of variable packet lengths from macro-model simulations are applied to inform past work on PEM with randomized packet lengths</description>

      <title>Structured identification of multivariable modal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physically interpretable models are essential for next-generation industrial systems, as these representations enable effective control, support design validation, and provide a foundation for monitoring strategies. The aim of this paper is to develop a system identification framework for estimating modal models of complex multivariable mechanical systems from frequency response data. To achieve this, a two-step structured identification algorithm is presented, where an additive model is first estimated using a refined instrumental variable method and subsequently projected onto a modal form. The developed identification method provides accurate, physically-relevant, minimal-order models, for both generally-damped and proportionally damped modal systems. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental validation on a prototype wafer-stage system, which features a large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibits complex flexible dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observability and parameter estimation of a generic model for aggregated distributed energy resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for estimating the parameters of an aggregated distributed energy resources (der_a) model. First, we introduce a rigorous method to determine whether all model parameters are estimable. When they are not, our approach identifies the subset of parameters that can be estimated. The proposed framework offers new insights into the number and specific parameters that can be reliably estimated based on commonly available measurements. It also highlights the limitations of calibrating such models. Second, we introduce a Kalman filtering method to calibrate the der_a model. Since we account for nonlinear effects such as saturation and deadbands, we develop a specific mechanism to handle smoothing functions within the Kalman filter. Specifically, we consider the extended and the unscented Kalman filter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on a modified IEEE 34-node distribution feeder with inverter-based resources. Our findings align with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's parameterization guideline and underscore the importance of model calibration in accurately capturing the collective dynamics of distributed energy resources installed on distribution systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multi-Modal Transportation and Electric Power Flow: The Value of Coordinated Dynamic Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrification of transportation represents a critical challenge in the global transition toward net-zero emissions, as the sector often accounts for more than one-quarter of national energy consumption. Achieving this transformation requires not only widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) but also their seamless integration into interdependent infrastructure systems-specifically, the transportation-electricity nexus (TEN). This paper develops an optimal multi-modal transportation and electric power flow (OMTEPF) model to evaluate the benefits of coordinated, dynamic system operation. Building on recent advances in hetero-functional graph theory, the framework enables joint optimization of five key operational decisions in intelligent TEN management: vehicle dispatch, route choice, charging station queuing, coordinated charging, and vehicle-to-grid stabilization. The mesoscopic, dynamic model explicitly represents individual EVs and their state-of-charge trajectories, thereby extending beyond the prevailing literature's focus on static, macroscopic traffic assignment. It further captures the full scope of the TEN as a system-of-systems, incorporating five distinct charging modalities: private residential, private commercial, wired public commercial, inductive public, and discharging. On the power system side, an IV-ACOPF formulation ensures globally optimal solutions to the electrical subproblems. Comparative analysis demonstrates the substantial value of coordinated TEN operation relative to the status quo of siloed, uncoordinated infrastructure management. This work provides both a novel methodological contribution and actionable insights for the co-design and operation of next-generation sustainable mobility-energy systems.</description>

      <title>Establishing assembly-oriented modular product architectures through Design for Assembly enhanced Modular Function Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular product design has become a strategic enabler for companies seeking to balance product variety, operational efficiency, and market responsiveness, making the alignment between modular architecture and manufacturing considerations increasingly critical. Modular Function Deployment (MFD) is a widely adopted method for defining modular product architectures, yet it lacks systematic support for assembly considerations during early concept and system-level development. This limitation increases the risk of delayed production ramp-up and lifecycle inefficiencies. This paper proposes a set of enhancements to MFD that integrate Design for Assembly (DFA) logic into architectural synthesis. The extended method introduces structured heuristics, assembly-oriented module drivers, a coded interface taxonomy, and quantitative metrics for assessing assembly feasibility and automation readiness. These additions preserve compatibility with standard MFD workflows while enriching decision-making with traceable, production-informed reasoning. An illustrative case study involving a handheld leaf blower demonstrates the method's usability and effectiveness. The redesigned architecture shows reduced assembly effort, simplified interfaces, and increased automation potential. By supporting early-stage evaluation of architectural alternatives through an assembly lens, the method enables faster transition to efficient volume production and provides a foundation for continuous improvement throughout the product lifecycle.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Bayesian Optimization for Timetable-Independent Railway Junction Performance Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of railway infrastructure is significantly influenced by the mix of trains that utilize it, as different service types have competing operational requirements. While freight services might require extended service times, passenger services demand more predictable schedules. Traditional methods for addressing long-term traffic assignment problems often rely on fixed-value capacity limitations, determined based on specific assumptions about traffic composition. This paper introduces a methodology for determining timetable-independent capacity within the traffic rate assignment problem, enabling the calculation of junction capacities under dynamic traffic distributions. We solve the underlying non-linear constrained optimization problem maximizing the traffic throughput using Bayesian optimization (BO). This setting combines a known objective function with expensive- to-compute capacity constraints, motivating an adaption of standard BO problems, where objective functions are usually unknown. We tailor the acquisition process in BO to this specific setting and increase performance by incorporating prior knowledge about the shape of the constraint functions into the Gaussian process surrogate model. Our derived approaches are benchmarked on a railway junction near Paris, significantly outperforming fixed traffic composition models and highlighting the benefits of dynamic capacity allocation.</description>

      <title>Edge-to-Cloud Computations-as-a-Service in Software-Defined Energy Networks for Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power grids face an acute mismatch between where data is generated and where it can be processed: protection relays, EV (Electric Vehicle) charging, and distributed renewables demand millisecond analytics at the edge, while energy-hungry workloads often sit in distant clouds leading to missed real-time deadlines and wasted power. We address this by proposing, to our knowledge, the first-ever SDEN (Software Defined Energy Network) for CaaS (Computations-as-a-Service) that unifies edge, fog, and cloud compute with 5G URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications), SDN (Software Defined Networking), and NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) to co-optimize energy, latency, and reliability end-to-end. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a joint task offloading formulation that couples computation placement with network capacity under explicit URLLC constraints; (ii) a feasibility preserving, lightweight greedy heuristic that scales while closely tracking optimal energy and latency trade-offs; and (iii) a tiered AI (Artificial Intelligence) pipeline-reactive at the edge, predictive in the fog, strategic in the cloud-featuring privacy-preserving, federated GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) for fault detection and microgrid coordination. Unlike prior edge-only or cloud-only schemes, SDEN turns fragmented grid compute into a single, programmable substrate that delivers dependable, energy-aware, real time analytics establishing a first-ever, software defined path to practical, grid-scale CaaS.</description>

      <title>pyspect: An Extensible Toolbox for Automatic Construction of Temporal Logic Trees via Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present pyspect, a Python toolbox that simplifies the use of reachability analysis for temporal logic problems. Currently, satisfying complex requirements in cyber-physical systems requires significant manual effort and domain expertise to develop the underlying reachability programs. This high development effort limits the broader adoption of reachability analysis for complex verification problems. To address this, pyspect provides a method-agnostic approach to performing reachability analysis for verifying a temporal logic specification via temporal logic trees (TLTs). It enables the specification of complex safety and liveness requirements using high-level logic formulations that are independent of any particular reachability technique or set representation. As a result, pyspect allows for the comparison of different reachability implementations, such as Hamilton-Jacobi and Hybrid Zonotope-based reachability analysis, for the same temporal logic specification. This design separates the concerns of implementation developers (who develop numerical procedures for reachability) and end-users (who write specifications). Through a simple vehicle example, we demonstrate how pyspect simplifies the synthesis of reachability programs, promotes specification reusability, and facilitates side-by-side comparisons of reachability techniques for complex tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient LLM Inference over Heterogeneous Edge Networks with Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference at the network edge is a promising serving paradigm that leverages distributed edge resources to run inference near users and enhance privacy. Existing edge-based LLM inference systems typically adopt autoregressive decoding (AD), which only generates one token per forward pass. This iterative process, compounded by the limited computational resources of edge nodes, results in high serving latency and constrains the system's ability to support multiple users under growing demands.To address these challenges, we propose a speculative decoding (SD)-based LLM serving framework that deploys small and large models across heterogeneous edge nodes to collaboratively deliver inference services. Specifically, the small model rapidly generates draft tokens that the large model verifies in parallel, enabling multi-token generation per forward pass and thus reducing serving latency. To improve resource utilization of edge nodes, we incorporate pipeline parallelism to overlap drafting and verification across multiple inference tasks. Based on this framework, we analyze and derive a comprehensive latency model incorporating both communication and inference latency. Then, we formulate a joint optimization problem for speculation length, task batching, and wireless communication resource allocation to minimize total serving latency. To address this problem, we derive the closed-form solutions for wireless communication resource allocation, and develop a dynamic programming algorithm for joint batching and speculation control strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves lower serving latency compared to AD-based serving systems. In addition,the proposed joint optimization method delivers up to 44.9% latency reduction compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>High-Order Quarter-Wave Plate Optimization for Linear Birefringence Suppression in Reflective FOCS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber optic current sensors (FOCS) are widely adopted in modern power grids due to high sensitivity, excellent insulation, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. This prominence necessitates precise investigation into their error sources and corresponding optimization. This study examines reflective FOCS based on the Faraday effect. A theoretical model is established to simulate phase error caused by linear birefringence from the quarter-wave plate. Conventional methods using circular birefringence are analyzed, revealing inherent limitations. Innovatively, a compensation strategy employing high-order quarter-wave plates is proposed to effectively eliminate linear birefringence effects. This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and practicality of FOCS in precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Estimation of Quadrotor Motor Efficiency via Residual Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven framework is proposed for online estimation of quadrotor motor efficiency via residual minimization. The problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization that minimizes trajectory residuals between measured flight data and predictions generated by a quadrotor dynamics model. A sliding-window strategy enables online estimation, and the optimization is efficiently solved using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) scheme combined with a primal-dual interior-point method, with inequality constraints enforced through a logarithmic barrier function. Robust z-score weighting is employed to reject outliers, which is particularly effective in motor clipping scenarios where the proposed estimator exhibits smaller spikes than an EKF baseline. Compared to traditional filter-based approaches, the batch-mode formulation offers greater flexibility by selectively incorporating informative data segments. This structure is well-suited for onboard implementation, particularly for applications such as fault detection and isolation (FDI), health monitoring, and predictive maintenance in aerial robotic systems. Simulation results under various degradation scenarios demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed estimator.</description>

      <title>Robust Closed-Form Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Conflicting Time-Varying Hard and Soft Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robust closed-form control law to handle time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust Recovery and Control of Cyber-physical Discrete Event Systems under Actuator Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical real-world applications strongly rely on Cyber-physical systems (CPS), but their dependence on communication networks introduces significant security risks, as attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to compromise their integrity and availability. This work explores the topic of cybersecurity in the context of CPS modeled as discrete event systems (DES), focusing on recovery strategies following the detection of cyberattacks. Specifically, we address actuator enablement attacks and propose a method that preserves the system's full valid behavior under normal conditions. Upon detecting an attack, our proposed solution aims to guide the system toward a restricted yet robust behavior, ensuring operational continuity and resilience. Additionally, we introduce a property termed AE-robust recoverability, which characterizes the necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering a system from attacks while preventing further vulnerabilities. Finally, we showcase the proposed solution through a case study based on a manufacturing system.</description>

      <title>Trajectory control of a suspended load with non-stopping flying carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first closed-loop control framework for cooperative payload transportation with non-stopping flying carriers. Building upon grasp-matrix formulations and internal force redundancy, we propose a feedback wrench controller that actively regulates the payload's pose while an optimization layer dynamically shapes internal-force oscillations to guarantee persistent carrier motion. Preliminary experimental results on multirotor UAVs validate the model assumptions, and numerical simulations demonstrate that the method successfully prevents carrier stagnation, achieves accurate load tracking, and generates physically feasible trajectories with smooth velocity profiles. The proposed framework not only advances the state of the art but also offers a reliable, versatile solution for future real-world applications requiring load transportation by coordinated non-stopping flying carriers.</description>

      <title>The Role of Flexible Connection in Accelerating Load Interconnection in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of flexible connection in accelerating the interconnection of large loads amid rising electricity demand from data centers and electrification. Flexible connection allows new loads to defer or curtail consumption during rare, grid-constrained periods, enabling faster access without major infrastructure upgrades. To quantify how flexible connection unlocks load hosting capacity, we formulate a flexibility-aware hosting capacity analysis problem that explicitly limits the number of utility-controlled interventions per year, ensuring infrequent disruption. Efficient solution methods are developed for this nonconvex problem and applied to real load data and test feeders. Empirical results reveal that modest flexibility, i.e., few interventions with small curtailments or delays, can unlock substantial hosting capacity. Theoretical analysis further explains and generalizes these findings, highlighting the broad potential of flexible connection.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning Approach for Degradation-Aware Long-Term Charging Optimization in Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries degrade with usage and continuous cycling. This aging is typically reflected through the resistance growth and the capacity fade of battery cells. Over the years, various charging methods have been presented in the literature that proposed current profiles in order to enable optimal, fast, and/or health-conscious charging. However, very few works have attempted to make the ubiquitous Constant Current Constant Voltage (CCCV) charging protocol adaptive to the changing battery health as it cycles. This work aims to address this gap and proposes a framework that optimizes the constant current part of the CCCV protocol adapting to long-term battery degradation. Specifically, a physics-informed Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach has been used that not only estimates a key battery degradation mechanism, namely, Loss of Active Material (LAM), but also adjusts the current magnitude of CCCV as a result of this particular degradation. The proposed framework has been implemented by combining PyBamm, an open-source battery modeling tool, and Stable-baselines where the RL agent was trained using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) network. Simulation results show the potential of the proposed framework for enhancing the widely used CCCV protocol by embedding physics information in RL algorithm. A comparative study of this proposed agent has also been discussed with 2 other charging protocols generated by a non-physics-based RL agent and a constant CCCV for all the cycles.</description>

      <title>Smooth Spatiotemporal Tube Synthesis for Prescribed-Time Reach-Avoid-Stay Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue of controller synthesis for a control-affine nonlinear system to meet prescribed time reach-avoid-stay specifications. Our goal is to improve upon previous methods based on spatiotemporal tubes (STTs) by eliminating the need for circumvent functions, which often lead to abrupt tube modifications and high control effort. We propose an adaptive framework that constructs smooth STTs around static unsafe sets, enabling continuous avoidance while guiding the system toward the target within the prescribed time. A closed-form, approximation-free control law is derived to ensure the system trajectory remains within the tube and satisfies the RAS task. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study, showing a significant reduction in control effort compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Geometric Heat Flow Equation: Computing Geodesics in Real-Time with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis on the convergence properties of the so-called geometric heat flow equation for computing geodesics (shortest-path~curves) on Riemannian manifolds. Computing geodesics numerically in real-time has become an important capability in several fields, including control and motion planning. The geometric heat flow equation involves solving a parabolic partial differential equation whose solution is a geodesic. In practice, solving this PDE numerically can be done efficiently, and tends to be more numerically stable and exhibit a better rate of convergence compared to numerical optimization. We prove that the geometric heat flow equation is globally exponentially stable in $L_2$ if the curvature of the Riemannian manifold is not too positive, and that asymptotic convergence in $L_2$ is always guaranteed. We also present a pseudospectral method that leverages Chebyshev polynomials to accurately compute geodesics in only a few milliseconds for non-contrived manifolds. Our analysis was verified with our custom pseudospectral method by computing geodesics on common non-Euclidean surfaces, and in feedback for a contraction-based controller with a non-flat metric for a nonlinear system.</description>

Abstract: The switching losses of power transistors are generally measured using the so-called double pulse method. Measuring the opposition of two switching cells is a complementary method that is more accurate but indirect. However, implementing this method can be more complex and requires calibration steps and comprehensive control, with the added issue of thermal management. In this context, we proposed to address this topic through open and collaborative science, first in the form of a two-day hackathon, followed by monthly open sessions. More than 20 participants contributed to the two-day hackathon, followed by monthly sessions for those wishing to continue working together. This enabled us to set up an automated bench, in open science, including the generation of switching commands, the configuration and control of measuring instruments, and the hardware part. Here we present and share our work and this open approach.</description>

      <title>Structured Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: a Bayesian Network Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The empirical success of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has motivated the search for more efficient and scalable algorithms for large scale multi-agent systems. However, existing state-of-the-art algorithms do not fully exploit inter-agent coupling information to develop MARL algorithms. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to leverage structures in the inter-agent couplings for efficient model-free reinforcement learning. We model the cooperative MARL problem via a Bayesian network and characterize the subset of agents, termed as the value dependency set, whose information is required by each agent to estimate its local action value function exactly. Moreover, we propose a partially decentralized training decentralized execution (P-DTDE) paradigm based on the value dependency set. We theoretically establish that the total variance of our P-DTDE policy gradient estimator is less than the centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) policy gradient estimator. We derive a multi-agent policy gradient theorem based on the P-DTDE scheme and develop a scalable actor-critic algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm on multi-warehouse resource allocation and multi-zone temperature control examples. For dense value dependency sets, we propose an approximation scheme based on truncation of the Bayesian network and empirically show that it achieves a faster convergence than the exact value dependence set for applications with a large number of agents.</description>

      <title>Causal-Guided Dimension Reduction for Efficient Pareto Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization of analog circuits is hindered by high-dimensional parameter spaces, strong feedback couplings, and expensive transistor-level simulations. Evolutionary algorithms such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) are widely used but treat all parameters equally, thereby wasting effort on variables with little impact on performance, which limits their scalability. We introduce CaDRO, a causal-guided dimensionality reduction framework that embeds causal discovery into the optimization pipeline. CaDRO builds a quantitative causal map through a hybrid observational-interventional process, ranking parameters by their causal effect on the objectives. Low-impact parameters are fixed to values from high-quality solutions, while critical drivers remain active in the search. The reduced design space enables focused evolutionary optimization without modifying the underlying algorithm. Across amplifiers, regulators, and RF circuits, CaDRO converges up to 10$\times$ faster than NSGA-II while preserving or improving Pareto quality. For instance, on the Folded-Cascode Amplifier, hypervolume improves from 0.56 to 0.94, and on the LDO regulator from 0.65 to 0.81, with large gains in non-dominated solutions.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Control with End-to-End Statistically Guaranteed Metric Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust control (DRC) recently emerges as a principled paradigm for handling uncertainty in stochastic dynamical systems. However, it constructs data-driven ambiguity sets via uniform distribution shifts before sequentially incorporating them into downstream control synthesis. This segregation between ambiguity set construction and control objectives inherently introduces a structural misalignment, which undesirably leads to conservative control policies with sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end finite-horizon Wasserstein DRC framework that integrates the learning of anisotropic Wasserstein metrics with downstream control tasks in a closed-loop manner, thus enabling ambiguity sets to be systematically adjusted along performance-critical directions and yielding more effective control policies. This framework is formulated as a bilevel program: the inner level characterizes dynamical system evolution under DRC, while the outer level refines the anisotropic metric leveraging control-performance feedback across a range of initial conditions. To solve this program efficiently, we develop a stochastic augmented Lagrangian algorithm tailored to the bilevel structure. Theoretically, we prove that the learned ambiguity sets preserve statistical finite-sample guarantees under a novel radius adjustment mechanism, and we establish the well-posedness of the bilevel formulation by demonstrating its continuity with respect to the learnable metric. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm converges to stationary points of the outer level problem, which are statistically consistent with the optimal metric at a non-asymptotic convergence rate. Experiments on both numerical and inventory control tasks verify that the proposed framework achieves superior closed-loop performance and robustness compared against state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid MAC Protocol with Integrated Multi-Layered Security for Resource-Constrained UAV Swarm Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) present unique challenges due to high node mobility, dynamic topologies, and strict resource constraints. Existing routing protocols often optimize for a single metric, such as path length or energy, while neglecting the complex dependencies between network performance, security, and MAC layer efficiency. This paper introduces a novel hardware software co design framework for secure and adaptive UAV swarm communications, featuring an energy aware protocol stack. The architecture employs a multicast, clustered organization where routing decisions integrate dynamic trust scores, historical link quality, and internodal distance. A hybrid MAC protocol combines contention based and scheduled channel access for optimized throughput. Security is ensured through a zero trust model that fuses cryptographic authentication with a behavioral reputation system, alongside hardware accelerated AES GCM encryption. Comparative analysis in an NS 3 simulation environment demonstrates the framework's superiority in packet delivery ratio, latency, resilience, and overhead, providing a scalable foundation for high performance swarm operations.</description>

Abstract: The regulator theorem states that, under certain conditions, any optimal controller must embody a model of the system it regulates, grounding the idea that controllers embed, explicitly or implicitly, internal models of the controlled. This principle underpins neuroscience and predictive brain theories like the Free-Energy Principle or Kolmogorov/Algorithmic Agent theory. However, the theorem is only proven in limited settings. Here, we treat the deterministic, closed, coupled world-regulator system $(W,R)$ as a single self-delimiting program $p$ via a constant-size wrapper that produces the world output string~$x$ fed to the regulator. We analyze regulation from the viewpoint of the algorithmic complexity of the output, $K(x)$. We define $R$ to be a \emph{good algorithmic regulator} if it \emph{reduces} the algorithmic complexity of the readout relative to a null (unregulated) baseline $\varnothing$, i.e., \[ \Delta = K\big(O_{W,\varnothing}\big) - K\big(O_{W,R}\big) &gt; 0. \] We then prove that the larger $\Delta$ is, the more world-regulator pairs with high mutual algorithmic information are favored. More precisely, a complexity gap $\Delta &gt; 0$ yields \[ \Pr\big((W,R)\mid x\big) \le C\,2^{\,M(W{:}R)}\,2^{-\Delta}, \] making low $M(W{:}R)$ exponentially unlikely as $\Delta$ grows. This is an AIT version of the idea that ``the regulator contains a model of the world.'' The framework is distribution-free, applies to individual sequences, and complements the Internal Model Principle. Beyond this necessity claim, the same coding-theorem calculus singles out a \emph{canonical scalar objective} and implicates a \emph{planner}. On the realized episode, a regulator behaves \emph{as if} it minimized the conditional description length of the readout.</description>

      <title>Towards Dynamic Quadrupedal Gaits: A Symmetry-Guided RL Hierarchy Enables Free Gait Transitions at Varying Speeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal, morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.</description>

      <title>A Verified High-Performance Composable Object Library for Remote Direct Memory Access (Extended Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is a memory technology that allows remote devices to directly write to and read from each other's memory, bypassing components such as the CPU and operating system. This enables low-latency high-throughput networking, as required for many modern data centres, HPC applications and AI/ML workloads. However, baseline RDMA comprises a highly permissive weak memory model that is difficult to use in practice and has only recently been formalised. In this paper, we introduce the Library of Composable Objects (LOCO), a formally verified library for building multi-node objects on RDMA, filling the gap between shared memory and distributed system programming. LOCO objects are well-encapsulated and take advantage of the strong locality and the weak consistency characteristics of RDMA. They have performance comparable to custom RDMA systems (e.g. distributed maps), but with a far simpler programming model amenable to formal proofs of correctness. To support verification, we develop a novel modular declarative verification framework, called Mowgli, that is flexible enough to model multinode objects and is independent of a memory consistency model. We instantiate Mowgli with the RDMA memory model, and use it to verify correctness of LOCO libraries.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Scaling 4ch Bilateral Control on the Cartesian coordinate by 6-DoF Manipulator using Rotation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate system regardless of the scaling factor.</description>

      <title>GPS Spoofing Attack Detection in Autonomous Vehicles Using Adaptive DBSCAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicles become an essential component of modern transportation, they are increasingly vulnerable to threats such as GPS spoofing attacks. This study presents an adaptive detection approach utilizing a dynamically tuned Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, designed to adjust the detection threshold ({\epsilon}) in real-time. The threshold is updated based on the recursive mean and standard deviation of displacement errors between GPS and in-vehicle sensors data, but only at instances classified as non-anomalous. Furthermore, an initial threshold, determined from 120,000 clean data samples, ensures the capability to identify even subtle and gradual GPS spoofing attempts from the beginning. To assess the performance of the proposed method, five different subsets from the real-world Honda Research Institute Driving Dataset (HDD) are selected to simulate both large and small magnitude GPS spoofing attacks. The modified algorithm effectively identifies turn-by-turn, stop, overshoot, and multiple small biased spoofing attacks, achieving detection accuracies of 98.621%, 99.960.1%, 99.880.1%, and 98.380.1%, respectively. This work provides a substantial advancement in enhancing the security and safety of AVs against GPS spoofing threats.</description>

      <title>Two-Layer Voronoi Coverage Control for Hybrid Aerial-Ground Robot Teams in Emergency Response: Implementation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency response scenarios. Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations, and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time, achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation code is available at https://github.com/dHutchings/ME292B.</description>

      <title>Storage Participation in Electricity Markets: Arbitrage and Ancillary Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity storage is used for intertemporal price arbitrage and for ancillary services that balance unforeseen supply and demand fluctuations via frequency regulation. We present an optimization model that computes bids for both arbitrage and frequency regulation and ensures that storage operators can honor their market commitments at all times for all fluctuation signals in an uncertainty set inspired by market rules. This requirement, initially expressed by an infinite number of nonconvex functional constraints, is shown to be equivalent to a finite number of deterministic constraints. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer bilinear program that admits mixed-integer linear relaxations and restrictions. Empirical tests on European electricity markets show a negligible optimality gap between the relaxation and the restriction. The model can account for intraday trading and, with a solution time of under 5 seconds, may serve as a building block for more complex trading strategies. Such strategies become necessary as battery capacity exceeds the demand for ancillary services. In a backtest from 1 July 2020 through 30 June 2024 joint market participation more than doubles profits and almost halves energy storage output compared to arbitrage alone.</description>

      <title>PhysHSI: Towards a Real-World Generalizable and Natural Humanoid-Scene Interaction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying, and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task goals, and natural motion patterns.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Communication for Vehicular Networks: A Tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of the fifth-generation technology promises to bring about more vertical applications and emerging services that include vehicular networks and intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). To achieve their vision of real-time and safetyapplications, vehicular networks rely on short-range to medium-range communications. One emerging technology that aims to provide reliability and high-data rate in short-range communications is the visible light communications (VLC). Due to its remarkable advantages, some studies have recently investigated the integration of VLC in vehicular networks and ITSs. Despite their attractive features, such networks also face several implementation issues. This paper provides an extended tutorial on the implementation of VLC-based vehicular networks. To begin with, we present the implementation characteristics of these systems and discuss some related issues. The underlying system considers a general structure with transmitters, channels, and receivers based on photodetectors and cameras, as well as standardization efforts and types of topologies. In addition, we discuss the impact of the sun and artificial light sources, flickering, dimming, throughput enhancement, uplink security, and mobility on practical implementation. Finally, we highlight some key challenges and potential solutions and provide some directions for future research investigations that could constitute an advancement toward the development of commercial VLC-based vehicular systems.</description>

      <title>Exponential convergence of multiagent systems with lack of connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding conditions ensuring consensus, i.e. convergence to a common value, for a networked system is of crucial interest, both for theoretical reasons and applications. This goal is harder to achieve when connections between agents are temporarily lost.
  Here, we prove that known conditions (introduced by Moreau) ensure an exponential convergence to consensus, with explicit rate of convergence. The key result is related to the length of the graph (i.e. the number of connections to reach a common agent): if this is large, then convergence is slow.
  This general result also provides conditions for convergence of second-order cooperative systems with lack of connections.</description>

      <title>A Faster and More Reliable Middleware for Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant (de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering, liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows 95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from 521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h) on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Action Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3, and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior methods.</description>

      <title>IntersectioNDE: Learning Complex Urban Traffic Dynamics based on Interaction Decoupling Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset (CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions, particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets, enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments. Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation, blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website: https://ego-vcp.github.io/</description>

      <title>Optimal Planning of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations: Integrating Public Charging Networks and Transportation Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) represents a critical shift in personal mobility, fueled by policy support and advancements in automotive technology. However, the expansion of EVs for long-distance travel is hindered by charging time concerns, the sparse distribution of charging stations, and the worsening waiting times due to congestion. The main objective of this work is two-fold: 1) first, to comprehensively analyze the existing public charging station robustness and effectively strategize for the new ones, and 2) secondly, to select the optimal chargers for long-distance journeys, by estimating the waiting time from current traffic congestion. This is achieved by accompanying effective EV charging strategies, pinpointing on the congestion points from the existing traffic, and the robustness of the current charging station infrastructure. Utilizing a real-time transportation and charging station dataset in Texas, we identify optimal charger placement strategies to minimize travel time by examining the congestion and charging time trade-offs. Our findings suggest that maximizing the constant current phase during charging enhances efficiency, crucial for long-distance travel. On the contrary, we also explore the negative impact of congestion on travel times and we conclude that sometimes it might be beneficial to exceed the constant current phase to avoid the congested charging stations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Assignment and Motion Control in Two-Class Continuum Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimal swarm control problems where two different classes of agents are present. Continuum idealizations of large-scale swarms are used where the dynamics describe the evolution of the spatially-distributed densities of each agent class. The problem formulation we adopt is motivated by applications where agents of one class are assigned to agents of the other class, which we refer to as demand and resource agents respectively. Assignments have costs related to the distances between mutually assigned agents, and the overall cost of an assignment is quantified by a Wasserstein distance between the densities of the two agent classes. When agents can move, the assignment cost can decrease at the expense of a physical motion cost, and this tradeoff sets up a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimal control problem. We show that in one spatial dimension, this problem can be converted to an infinite-dimensional, but decoupled, linear-quadratic (LQ) tracking problem when expressed in terms of the quantile functions of the respective agent densities. Solutions are given in the general one-dimensional case, as well as in the special cases of constant and periodically time-varying demands.</description>

      <title>DUST: A Framework for Data-Driven Density Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of data-driven stochastic optimal control of an unknown LTI dynamical system. Assuming the process noise is normally distributed, we pose the problem of steering the state's mean and covariance to a target normal distribution, under noisy data collected from the underlying system, a problem commonly referred to as covariance steering (CS). A novel framework for Data-driven Uncertainty quantification and density STeering (DUST) is presented that simultaneously characterizes the noise affecting the measured data and designs an optimal affine-feedback controller to steer the density of the state to a prescribed terminal value. We use both indirect and direct data-driven design approaches based on the notions of persistency of excitation and subspace identification to exactly represent the mean and covariance dynamics of the state in terms of the data and noise realizations. Since both the mean and the covariance steering sub-problems are plagued with stochastic uncertainty arising from noisy data collection, we first estimate the noise realization from this dataset and subsequently compute tractable upper bounds on the estimation errors. The first and second moment steering problems are then solved to optimality using techniques from robust control and robust optimization. Lastly, we present an alternative control design approach based on the certainty equivalence principle and interpret the problem as one of CS under multiplicative uncertainty. We analyze the performance and efficacy of each of these data-driven approaches using a case study and compare them with their model-based counterparts.</description>

      <title>Multiple input tangential interpolation-driven damage detection of a jet trainer aircraft</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of damage detection and identification is of interest for many aerospace and aeronautical engineering systems. However, relevant literature mostly focuses on subsystems and parts, rather than full airframes. In structural dynamics, modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and mode shapes, from any structure are the main building blocks of vibration-based damage detection. However, traditional comparisons of these parameters are often ambiguous in complex systems, complicating damage detection and assessment. The modified total modal assurance criterion (MTMAC), an index well-known in the field of finite element model updating, is extended to address this challenge and is proposed as an index for damage identification and severity assessment. To support the requirement for precise and robust modal identification of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the improved Loewner Framework (iLF), known for its reliability and computational performance, is pioneeringly employed within SHM. Since the MTMAC is proposed solely as a damage identification and severity assessment index, the coordinate modal assurance criterion (COMAC), also a well-established tool, but for damage localisation using mode shapes, is used for completeness. The iLF SHM capabilities are validated through comparisons with traditional methods, including least-squares complex exponential and stochastic subspace identification with canonical variate analysis on a numerical case study of a cantilever beam. Furthermore, the MTMAC is validated against the traditional vibration-based approach, which involves directly comparing natural frequencies and mode shapes. Finally, an experimental dataset from a BAE Systems Hawk T1A jet trainer ground vibration test is used to demonstrate the iLF and MTMAC capabilities on a real-life, real-size SHM problem, showing their effectiveness in detecting and assessing damage.</description>

      <title>Global Attitude Synchronization for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Systems on SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of attitude synchronization for a group of rigid body systems evolving on SO(3). The interaction among these systems is modeled through an undirected, connected, and acyclic graph topology. First, we present an almost global continuous distributed attitude synchronization scheme with rigorously proven stability guarantees. Thereafter, we propose two global distributed hybrid attitude synchronization schemes on SO(3). The first scheme is a hybrid control law that leverages angular velocities and relative orientations to achieve global alignment to a common orientation. The second scheme eliminates the dependence on angular velocities by introducing dynamic auxiliary variables, while ensuring global asymptotic attitude synchronization. This velocity-free control scheme relies exclusively on attitude information. The proposed schemes are applicable to heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents may have distinct inertia matrices. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed attitude synchronization schemes.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Innovation-based Stochastic and Deterministic Event Triggers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resources such as bandwidth and energy are limited in many wireless communications use cases, especially when large numbers of sensors and fusion centers need to exchange information frequently. One opportunity to overcome resource constraints is the use of event-based transmissions and estimation to transmit only information that contributes significantly to the reconstruction of the system's state. The design of efficient triggering policies and estimators is crucial for successful event-based transmissions. While previously deterministic and stochastic event triggering policies have been treated separately, this paper unifies the two approaches and gives insights into the design of consistent trigger-matching estimators. Two different estimators are presented, and different pairs of triggers and estimators are evaluated through simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of decoupling feeding networks for antenna arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field and radiation coupling between nearby radiating elements is unavoidable, and it is considered a limiting factor for applications in wireless communications and active sensing. This article proposes a density-based topology optimization approach to design decoupling networks for such systems. The decoupling networks are designed based on a multi-objective optimization problem with the radiating elements replaced by their time-domain impulse response for efficient computations and to enable the solution of the design problem using gradient-based optimization methods. We use the adjoint-field method to compute the gradients of the optimization objectives. Additionally, nonlinear filters are applied during the optimization procedure to impose minimum-size control on the optimized designs. We demonstrate the concept by designing the decoupling network for a two-element planar antenna array; the antenna is designed in a separate optimization problem. The optimized decoupling networks provide a signal path that destructively interferes with the coupling between the radiating elements while preserving their individual matching to the feeding ports. Compact decoupling networks capable of suppressing the mutual coupling by more than 10 dB between two closely separated planar antennas operating around 2.45 GHz are presented and validated experimentally.</description>

      <title>A Taylor Series Approach to Correction of Input Errors in Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely recognized as powerful non-parametric models for regression and classification. Traditional GP frameworks predominantly operate under the assumption that the inputs are either accurately known or subject to zero-mean noise. However, several real-world applications such as mobile sensors have imperfect localization, leading to inputs with biased errors. These biases can typically be estimated through measurements collected over time using, for example, Kalman filters. To avoid recomputation of the entire GP model when better estimates of the inputs used in the training data become available, we introduce a technique for updating a trained GP model to incorporate updated estimates of the inputs. By leveraging the differentiability of the mean and covariance functions derived from the squared exponential kernel, a second-order correction algorithm is developed to update the trained GP models. Precomputed Jacobians and Hessians of kernels enable real-time refinement of the mean and covariance predictions. The efficacy of the developed approach is demonstrated using two simulation studies, with error analyses revealing improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</description>

Abstract: A geometric interpretation of the equinoctial elements is given with a connection to orthogonal rotations and attitude dynamics in Euclidean 3-space. An identification is made between the equinoctial elements and classic Rodrigues parameters. A new set of equinoctial elements are developed using the modified Rodrigues parameters, thereby removing the coordinate singularity for retrograde equatorial orbits present in previous versions of these elements. A low-thrust trajectory optimization problem is set up using the new elements to numerically verify convergence for the two-point boundary problem, as compared to their predecessors.</description>

      <title>Gait Transitions in Load-Pulling Quadrupeds: Insights from Sled Dogs and a Minimal SLIP Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadrupedal animals employ diverse galloping strategies to optimize speed, stability, and energy efficiency. However, the biomechanical mechanisms that enable adaptive gait transitions during high-speed locomotion under load remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new empirical and modeling insights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled dogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled dogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a few strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or terrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed load-pulling. To investigate the mechanical basis of these transitions, a physics-based quadrupedal Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model with hybrid dynamics and prescribed footfall sequences to reproduce the asymmetric galloping patterns observed in racing sled dogs. Through trajectory optimization, we replicate experimentally observed gait sequences and identify swing-leg stiffness modulation as a key control mechanism for inducing transitions. This work provides a much-needed biomechanical perspective on high-speed animal draft and establishes a modeling framework for studying locomotion in pulling quadrupeds, with implications for both biological understanding and the design of adaptive legged systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Security Policies via Belief Aggregation and Rollout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolving security vulnerabilities and shifting operational conditions require frequent updates to network security policies. These updates include adjustments to incident response procedures and modifications to access controls, among others. Reinforcement learning methods have been proposed for automating such policy adaptations, but most of the methods in the research literature lack performance guarantees and adapt slowly to changes. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a method for computing security policies that is scalable, offers theoretical guarantees, and adapts quickly to changes. It assumes a model or simulator of the system and comprises three components: belief estimation through particle filtering, offline policy computation through aggregation, and online policy adaptation through rollout. Central to our method is a new feature-based aggregation technique, which improves scalability and flexibility. We analyze the approximation error of aggregation and show that rollout efficiently adapts policies to changes under certain conditions. Simulations and testbed results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, including CAGE-2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a systematic and scalable method for arbitrary rigid-bodies equipped with vectorized thrusters. Two novel solutions are proposed: a closed-form, Lipschitz continuous mapping that ensures smooth actuator orientation references, and a convex optimization formulation capable of handling practical actuator constraints such as thrust saturation and angular rate limits. Both methods leverage the null-space structure of the allocation mapping to perform singularity avoidance while generating sub-optimal yet practical solutions. The effectiveness and generality of the proposed framework are demonstrated through numerical simulations on a 3DOF marine vessel and a 6DOF aerial quadcopter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.05198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limbless animals such as snakes, limbless lizards, worms, eels, and lampreys move their slender, long bodies in three dimensions to traverse diverse environments. Accurately quantifying their continuous body's 3-D shape and motion is important for understanding body-environment interactions in complex terrain, but this is difficult to achieve (especially for local orientation and rotation). Here, we describe an interpolation method to quantify continuous body 3-D position and orientation. We simplify the body as an elastic rod and apply a backbone optimization method to interpolate continuous body shape between end constraints imposed by tracked markers. Despite over-simplifying the biomechanics, our method achieves a higher interpolation accuracy (~50% error) in both 3-D position and orientation compared with the widely-used cubic B-spline interpolation method. Beyond snakes traversing large obstacles as demonstrated, our method applies to other long, slender, limbless animals and continuum robots. We provide codes and demo files for easy application of our method.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Inferential Control of Neural State-Space Models for Autonomous Vehicle Motion Planning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08045v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has proven useful in enabling safe and optimal motion planning for autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve MPC-based motion planning when a neural state-space model represents the vehicle dynamics. As the neural state-space model will lead to highly complex, nonlinear and nonconvex optimization landscapes, mainstream gradient-based MPC methods will be computationally too heavy to be a viable solution. In a departure, we propose the idea of model predictive inferential control (MPIC), which seeks to infer the best control decisions from the control objectives and constraints. Following the idea, we convert the MPC problem for motion planning into a Bayesian state estimation problem. Then, we develop a new particle filtering/smoothing approach to perform the estimation. This approach is implemented as banks of unscented Kalman filters/smoothers and offers high sampling efficiency, fast computation, and estimation accuracy. We evaluate the MPIC approach through a simulation study of autonomous driving in different scenarios, along with an exhaustive comparison with gradient-based MPC. The results show that the MPIC approach has considerable computational efficiency, regardless of complex neural network architectures, and shows the capability to solve large-scale MPC problems for neural state-space models.</description>

      <title>Modeling nonuniform energy decay through the modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling late reverberation in real-time interactive applications is a challenging task when multiple sound sources and listeners are present in the same environment. This is especially problematic when the environment is geometrically complex and/or features uneven energy absorption (e.g. coupled volumes), because in such cases the late reverberation is dependent on the sound sources' and listeners' positions, and therefore must be adapted to their movements in real time. We present a novel approach to the task, named modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART), which can handle highly complex scenarios with efficiency. The approach is based on the geometrical acoustics method of acoustic radiance transfer, from which we extract a set of energy decay modes and their positional relationships with sources and listeners. In this paper, we describe the physical and mathematical significance of MoD-ART, highlighting its advantages and applicability to different scenarios. Through an analysis of the method's computational complexity, we show that it compares very favorably with ray-tracing. We also present simulation results showing that MoD-ART can capture multiple decay slopes and flutter echoes.</description>

Abstract: This work considers a large class of systems composed of multiple quadrotors manipulating deformable and extensible cables. The cable is described via a discretized representation, which decomposes it into linear springs interconnected through lumped-mass passive spherical joints. Sets of flat outputs are found for the systems. Numerical simulations support the findings by showing cable manipulation relying on flatness-based trajectories. Eventually, we present an experimental validation of the effectiveness of the proposed discretized cable model for a two-robot example. Moreover, a closed-loop controller based on the identified model and using cable-output feedback is experimentally tested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper address the optimal voltage control problem of distribution systems with high penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources, under inaccurate model information. We propose the online exponential barrier method that explicitly leverages the online feedback from grids to enhance the robustness to model inaccuracy and incorporates the voltage constraints to maintain the safety requirements. We provide analytical results on the optimal barrier parameter selection and sufficient conditions for the safety guarantee of converged voltages. We also establish theoretical results on the exponential convergence rate with proper step-size. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 56-bus radial network, where we significantly improve the robustness against model inaccuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>

      <title>Learning Satellite Attitude Dynamics with Physics-Informed Normalising Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks, relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete, difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data. However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased robustness-to-noise.</description>

      <title>A Vision-Based Shared-Control Teleoperation Scheme for Controlling the Robotic Arm of a Four-Legged Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.</description>

      <title>Autonomous UAV Flight Navigation in Confined Spaces: A Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous UAV inspection of confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation ducts, demands robust navigation policies where collisions are unacceptable. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a powerful paradigm for developing such policies, it presents a critical trade-off between on-policy and off-policy algorithms. Off-policy methods promise high sample efficiency, a vital trait for minimizing costly and unsafe real-world fine-tuning. In contrast, on-policy methods often exhibit greater training stability, which is essential for reliable convergence in hazard-dense environments. This paper directly investigates this trade-off by comparing a leading on-policy algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), against an off-policy counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), for precision flight in procedurally generated ducts within a high-fidelity simulator. Our results show that PPO consistently learned a stable, collision-free policy that completed the entire course. In contrast, SAC failed to find a complete solution, converging to a suboptimal policy that navigated only the initial segments before failure. This work provides evidence that for high-precision, safety-critical navigation tasks, the reliable convergence of a well-established on-policy method can be more decisive than the nominal sample efficiency of an off-policy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Grasping in Legged Robots: A Deep Learning Approach to Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, with a focus on improving precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.</description>

      <title>ASTREA: Introducing Agentic Intelligence for Orbital Thermal Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system executed on flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations, with on-orbit operation aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. On-orbit validation aboard the ISS initially faced challenges due to inference latency misaligned with the rapid thermal cycles of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Synchronization with the orbit length successfully surpassed the baseline with reduced violations, extended episode durations, and improved CPU utilization. These findings demonstrate the potential for scalable agentic supervision architectures in future autonomous spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</description>

      <title>ORN-CBF: Learning Observation-conditioned Residual Neural Control Barrier Functions via Hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been demonstrated as an effective method for safety-critical control of autonomous systems. Although CBFs are simple to deploy, their design remains challenging, motivating the development of learning-based approaches. Yet, issues such as suboptimal safe sets, applicability in partially observable environments, and lack of rigorous safety guarantees persist. In this work, we propose observation-conditioned neural CBFs based on Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which approximately recover the maximal safe sets. We exploit certain mathematical properties of the HJ value function, ensuring that the predicted safe set never intersects with the observed failure set. Moreover, we leverage a hypernetwork-based architecture that is particularly suitable for the design of observation-conditioned safety filters. The proposed method is examined both in simulation and hardware experiments for a ground robot and a quadcopter. The results show improved success rates and generalization to out-of-domain environments compared to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Product Digital Twin Supporting End-of-life Phase of Electric Vehicle Batteries Utilizing Product-Process-Resource Asset Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a circular economy, products in their end-of-life phase should be either remanufactured or recycled. Both of these processes are crucial for sustainability and environmental conservation. However, manufacturers frequently do not support these processes enough in terms of not sharing relevant data about the products nor their (re-)manufacturing processes. This paper proposes to accompany each product with a digital twin technology, specifically the Product Digital Twin (PDT), which can carry information for facilitating and optimizing production and remanufacturing processes. This paper introduces a knowledge representation called Bi-Flow Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (Bi-PAN). Bi-PAN extends a well-proven Product-Process-Resource Asset Network (PAN) paradigm by integrating both assembly and disassembly workflows into a single information model. Such networks enable capturing relevant relationships across products, production resources, manufacturing processes, and specific production operations that have to be done in the manufacturing phase of a product. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a use-case of disassembling electric vehicle (EV) batteries. By utilizing PDTs with Bi-PAN knowledge models, challenges associated with disassembling of EV batteries can be solved flexibly and efficiently for various battery types, enhancing the sustainability of the EV battery life-cycle management.</description>
