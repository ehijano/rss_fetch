      <title>Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle Method for Multiscale Flow Simulation of Partially Ionized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unified Gas-Kinetic Wave-Particle (UGKWP) method is constructed for partially ionized plasma (PIP). This method possesses both multiscale and unified preserving (UP) properties. The multiscale property allows the method to capture a wide range of plasma physics, from the particle transport in the kinetic regime to the two-fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the near continuum regimes, with the variation of local cell Knudsen number and normalized Larmor radius.The unified preserving property ensures that the numerical time step is not limited by the particle collision time in the continuum regime for the capturing of dissipative macroscopic solutions of the resistivity, Hall-effect, and all the way to the ideal MHD equations.The UGKWP is clearly distinguishable from the classical single scale Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collision (PIC/MCC) methods.The UGKWP method combines the evolution of microscopic velocity distribution with the evolution of macroscopic mean field quantities, granting it UP properties. Moreover, the time step in UGKWP is not constrained by the plasma cyclotron period through the Crank-Nicolson scheme for fluid and electromagnetic field interactions. The momentum and energy exchange between different species is approximated by the Andries-Aoki-Perthame (AAP) model. Overall, the UGKWP method enables a smooth transition from the PIC method in the rarefied regime to the MHD solvers in the continuum regime. This method has been extensively tested on a variety of phenomena ranging from kinetic Landau damping to the macroscopic flow problems, such as the Brio-Wu shock tube, Orszag-Tang vortex, and Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) magnetic reconnection. These tests demonstrate that the proposed method can capture the fundamental features of PIP across different scales seamlessly.</description>

      <title>Modeling straight and circle swimmers via immersed boundary methods: from single swimmer to collective motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a minimal model of microswimmer based on immersed boundary methods. We describe a swimmer (either pusher or puller) as a distribution of point forces, representing the swimmer's flagellum and body, with only the latter subjected to no-slip boundary conditions with respect to the surrounding fluid. In particular, our model swimmer consists of only three beads (two for the body and one for the flagellum) connected by inextensible and rigid links. When the beads are collinear, standard straight swimming is realized and, in the absence of propulsion, we demonstrate that the swimmer's body behaves as an infinitely thin rod. Conversely, by imposing an angle between body and flagellum the swimmer moves on circular orbits. We then discuss how two swimmers, in collinear or non-collinear geometry, scatter upon encounter. Finally, we explore the dynamics of a large number of swimmers reacting to one another only via hydrodynamic interactions, and exemplify their complex collective dynamics in both straight and circular swimmers.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals exhibit a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are metallic due to self-doping. And the ML also shows features of heavy fermions, which indicates that there may be Kondo physics in 1313-La327. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (La4310). The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL (TL-outer Ni) show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Method for Quasinormal Modes of Non-Relativistic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Aluminium nanoparticle-based ultra-wideband high-performance polarizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarizer-based device industry is expanding quickly, requiring high-quality research on nanoscale wideband polarizers. Here, we investigated the possibility of utilizing Al dimer nanostructures on broad-band polarizers. Metals are always considered promising candidates for reflection-based polarizer development because of their high extinction ratio. This study proposes a nanoparticle polarizer comprised of semi-immersed Al nanodimers with a 200 nm radius on a CaF_2 substrate. Our proposed polarizer has effective polarization anisotropy in the near-infrared (NIR) and THz range. This study includes calculating performance parameters for the extraction of the proposed polarizer, including insertion loss, extinction ratio (ER), Mueller matrix values, and polarization ellipse diagram. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation-based results suggested obtaining more than 55 dB extinction ratio for the 0.2 to 9 THz range. The average extinction ratio and insertion loss over the 1-1665 micrometer wavelength were 29.01 dB and ~1 dB, respectively. We have reviewed recent reports of similar nanoparticle and wire grid-based polarizers to evaluate our Al nanodimer-based polarizer and performed a comparative analysis. The idea of Al dimer and the insight gained from the results extracted from the rigorous simulation report suggested a great opportunity for developing micro-scale metallic wideband polarizers.</description>
