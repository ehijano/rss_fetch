      <title>Matisse: Visualizing Measured Internet Latencies as Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manifolds are complex topological spaces that can be used to represent datasets of real-world measurements. Visualizing such manifolds can help with illustrating their topological characteristics (e.g., curvature) and providing insights into important properties of the underlying data (e.g., anomalies in the measurements). In this paper, we describe a new methodology and system for generating and visualizing manifolds that are inferred from actual Internet latency measurements between different cities and are projected over a 2D Euclidean space (e.g., a geographic map). Our method leverages a series of graphs that capture critical information contained in the data, including well-defined locations (for vertices) and Ricci curvature information (for edges). Our visualization approach then generates a curved surface (manifold) in which (a) geographical locations of vertices are maintained and (b) the Ricci curvature values of the graph edges determine the curvature properties of the manifold. The resulting manifold highlights areas of critical connectivity and defines an instance of "Internet delay space" where latency measurements manifest as geodesics. We describe details of our method and its implementation in a tool, which we call Matisse, for generating, visualizing and manipulating manifolds projected onto a base map. We illustrate Matisse with two case studies: a simple example to demonstrate key concepts, and visualizations of the US public Internet to show Matisse's utility.</description>

      <title>UTM Performance Under Stressing Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proliferation of new classes of airspace participants, including uncrewed and advanced aerial mobility vehicles, necessitates the development and deployment of novel airspace management solutions, such as the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) system and the Provider of Services to UAM (PSU) Network. The efficacy of such systems has been demonstrated on multiple occasions via real-world deployments in limited test environments, however exploration of system behavior under stressing conditions requires the development of appropriate modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) environments. Autonomy Networks for Advanced Mobility at Lincoln Laboratory (ANAMLL) is a virtual Systems Integration Laboratory (SIL) designed to host federated autonomy networks, such as a UTM or PSU Network, and to enable test and validation at scales not available in real-world deployments. As an example of ANAMLL's utility, we explore the performance of a representative UTM network during a stressing demand scenario. In a close examination of the demand scenario, ANAMLL demonstrates a UTM system demand point at which in-flight replanning can no longer be accomplished within an allowable time window. In a second analysis of the same scenario, ANAMLL demonstrates the impact of network connectivity performance on end-user airspace access.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 6G Network Security and Incident Response through Integrated VNF and SDN Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-speed internet can negatively affect incident response in a number of ways, including decreased teamwork, delayed detection, inefficient action, and elevated risk. Delayed data acquisition and processing may result from inadequate internet connectivity, hindering security teams' ability to obtain the necessary information for timely and effective responses. Each of these factors may augment the organization's susceptibility to security incidents and their subsequent ramifications. This article establishes a virtual network function service delivery network (VNFSDN) through the integration of virtual network function (VNF) and software-defined networking (SDN) technologies. The VNFSDN approach enhances network security effectiveness and efficiency while reducing the danger of breaches. This method assists security services in rapidly assessing vast quantities of data generated by 6G networks. VNFSDN adapts dynamically to changing safety requirements and connection conditions through the use of SDN and VNF. This flexibility enables enterprises to mitigate or halt the impact of cyberattacks by swiftly identifying and addressing security threats. The VNFSDN enhances network resilience, allowing operators to proactively mitigate possible security attacks and minimize downtime. The incorporation of machine learning and artificial intelligence into VNFSDN can significantly improve network security and threat detection capabilities. The VNFSDN integrates VNF and SDN technologies to deliver security services that analyze vast quantities of 6G data in real time. As security requirements and network conditions evolve, it adapts dynamically to enhance network resilience and facilitate proactive threat detection.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Intelligence Via Wireless Network-Driven LLMs Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ubiquitous intelligence as a paradigm where Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve within wireless network-driven ecosystems. Unlike static model deployments, this approach enables scalable and continuous intelligence ascension through coordination between networks and LLMs. Wireless networks support system-orchestrated lifelong learning, while LLMs drive the next-generation network development that is more adaptive and responsive. This co-evolution highlights a shift toward self-improving systems, sustaining capability growth across diverse and resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>SKYLINK: Scalable and Resilient Link Management in LEO Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of space-based services has established LEO satellite networks as a promising option for global broadband connectivity. Next-generation LEO networks leverage inter-satellite links (ISLs) to provide faster and more reliable communications compared to traditional bent-pipe architectures, even in remote regions. However, the high mobility of satellites, dynamic traffic patterns, and potential link failures pose significant challenges for efficient and resilient routing. To address these challenges, we model the LEO satellite network as a time-varying graph comprising a constellation of satellites and ground stations. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of average delay and packet drop rate. Each satellite independently decides how to distribute its incoming traffic to neighboring nodes in real time. Given the infeasibility of finding optimal solutions at scale, due to the exponential growth of routing options and uncertainties in link capacities, we propose SKYLINK, a novel fully distributed learning strategy for link management in LEO satellite networks. SKYLINK enables each satellite to adapt to the time-varying network conditions, ensuring real-time responsiveness, scalability to millions of users, and resilience to network failures, while maintaining low communication overhead and computational complexity. To support the evaluation of SKYLINK at global scale, we develop a new simulator for large-scale LEO satellite networks. For 25.4 million users, SKYLINK reduces the weighted sum of average delay and drop rate by 29% compared to the bent-pipe approach, and by 92% compared to Dijkstra. It lowers drop rates by 95% relative to k-shortest paths, 99% relative to Dijkstra, and 74% compared to the bent-pipe baseline, while achieving up to 46% higher throughput. At the same time, SKYLINK maintains constant computational complexity with respect to constellation size.</description>

      <title>Design and Development of a Scalable and Energy-Efficient Localization Framework Leveraging LoRa Ranging-Capable Transceivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise and energy-efficient localization is a critical requirement in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, particularly in large-scale deployments such as asset tagging, agriculture, and smart cities, where long battery life and cost-effectiveness are crucial. The Semtech SX1280 LoRa transceiver presents a promising solution for IoT localization. It combines low cost, low power, and precise ranging capability over distances of up to 1 km. However, the ranging process requires two devices to be simultaneously active, one initiating the ranging request and the other responding to it, which can lead to significant energy expenditure if not properly managed. Despite the transceiver's excellent performance, no existing system-level framework effectively manages sleep-wake coordination and role assignment needed for energy-efficient operation. This paper presents a coordination framework that significantly reduces power consumption while maintaining the inherent precise ranging capability of the chip. The framework schedules short, synchronized wake-up windows between the initiator and the responder, allowing devices to remain in deep sleep for most of their duty cycle. This scheduling strategy minimizes reliance on precise continuous timing and mitigates drift in low-cost oscillators. To validate the framework, we designed and developed custom nodes that are compliant with the framework's protocol. Experimental results show that the proposed approach allows a node to stay in ultra-low power mode and wake periodically to check for instructions. The node can remain in standby mode for up to nine months on a single coin cell battery and can perform ranging operations on demand in near real-time, all while maintaining a localization accuracy within five meters.</description>

      <title>The Role of Legacy Mobile Networks in Infrastructure Resilience: Evidence from the Southern Brazil Flood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the resilience of mobile communication networks during the extreme flooding that affected Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in May 2024. Based on regulatory data and technical insights from operators, the study identifies the leading causes of mobile network disruptions, primarily related to flooding and prolonged power outages. The results reveal the significant vulnerability of modern networks (4G/5G) during the event and the essential role played by legacy technologies (2G/3G) in sustaining basic connectivity under adverse conditions. The findings underscore the necessity of disaster-aware infrastructure planning, taking into account the ongoing significance of legacy systems, diversified power supply strategies, and resilient network designs to enhance service continuity during future crises.</description>

      <title>From Physical to Logical: Graph-State-Based Connectivity in Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is a key resource in quantum communication, but bipartite schemes are often insufficient for advanced protocols like quantum secret sharing or distributed computing. Graph states offer a flexible way to represent and manage multipartite entanglement in quantum networks, enabling logical connectivity through local operations and classical communication (LOCC). In this work, we extend existing approaches based on bi-star configurations to more complex multi-star topologies. We analyze the maximum connectivity that can be achieved in networks of $m$ switches, each connected to $n$ clients, including asymmetric cases where the number of clients varies per switch. We also propose methods to enable logical communication between distant nodes. Our results support the development of scalable quantum networks with rich connectivity beyond traditional bipartite structures.</description>

      <title>Robust Belief-State Policy Learning for Quantum Network Routing Under Decoherence and Time-Varying Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a feature-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework for quantum network routing, combining belief-state planning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to address partial observability, decoherence, and scalability challenges in dynamic quantum systems. Our approach encodes complex quantum network dynamics, including entanglement degradation and time-varying channel noise, into a low-dimensional feature space, enabling efficient belief updates and scalable policy learning. The core of our framework is a hybrid GNN-POMDP architecture that processes graph-structured representations of entangled links to learn routing policies, coupled with a noise-adaptive mechanism that fuses POMDP belief updates with GNN outputs for robust decision making. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing guarantees for belief convergence, policy improvement, and robustness to noise. Experiments on simulated quantum networks with up to 100 nodes demonstrate significant improvements in routing fidelity and entanglement delivery rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under high decoherence and nonstationary conditions.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Data Augmentation in Wireless Networks: Analysis, Applications, and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data augmentation as a technique can mitigate data scarcity in machine learning. However, owing to fundamental differences in wireless data structures, traditional data augmentation techniques may not be suitable for wireless data. Fortunately, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can be an effective solution to wireless data augmentation due to its excellent data generation capability. This article systematically explores the potential and effectiveness of generative data augmentation in wireless networks. We first briefly review data augmentation techniques, discuss their limitations in wireless networks, and introduce generative data augmentation, including reviewing GenAI models and their applications in data augmentation. We then explore the application prospects of generative data augmentation in wireless networks from the physical, network, and application layers, providing a generative data augmentation architecture for each application. Subsequently, we propose a general generative data augmentation framework for Wi-Fi gesture recognition. Specifically, we leverage transformer-based diffusion models to generate high-quality channel state information data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct a case study using the Widar 3.0 dataset, which employs a residual network model for Wi-Fi gesture recognition. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can enhance the performance of Wi-Fi gesture recognition. Finally, we discuss research directions for generative data augmentation.</description>
