      <title>Daily Liquidity Jump and Diffusion, and Treatment on Crypto Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wash trading among crypto assets induces short-term price jumps, which manifest as liquidity fluctuation. We develop a model to decompose asset liquidity into two components: liquidity jump and liquidity diffusion, which quantify the size and probability of wash trading. Using the trading data from US stock markets as a benchmark, we establish that the combination of high liquidity diffusion and high liquidity jump indicates wash trading. On the other hand, the majority of large-volume trades with high liquidity jump but low liquidity diffusion (&lt;1) are actually legitimate ones. Our model provides advice to investors in making informed decisions in crypto investments, and to regulators in taking targeted actions to combat wash trading. While we use crypto assets to exemplify the utilities of our model, the model should remain effective for other asset classes with extreme liquidity.</description>

      <title>Subset second-order stochastic dominance for enhanced indexation with diversification enforced by sector constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we apply second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) to the problem of enhanced indexation with asset subset (sector) constraints. The problem we consider is how to construct a portfolio that is designed to outperform a given market index whilst having regard to the proportion of the portfolio invested in distinct market sectors.
  In our approach, subset SSD, the portfolio associated with each sector is treated in a SSD manner. In other words in subset SSD we actively try to find sector portfolios that SSD dominate their respective sector indices. However the proportion of the overall portfolio invested in each sector is not pre-specified, rather it is decided via optimisation. Our subset SSD approach involves the numeric solution of a multivariate second-order stochastic dominance problem.
  Computational results are given for our approach as applied to the S&amp;P500 over the period 3rd October 2018 to 29th December 2023. This period, over 5 years, includes the Covid pandemic, which had a significant effect on stock prices. The S&amp;P500 data that we have used is made publicly available for the benefit of future researchers. Our computational results indicate that the scaled version of our subset SSD approach outperforms the S&amp;P500. Our approach also outperforms the standard SSD based approach to the problem. Our results show, that for the S&amp;P500 data considered, including sector constraints improves out-of-sample performance, irrespective of the SSD approach adopted. Results are also given for Fama-French data involving 49 industry portfolios and these confirm the effectiveness of our subset SSD approach.</description>
