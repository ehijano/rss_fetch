      <title>Fluorescent emission and nondestructive 3D textural imaging in geologic materials by multiphoton microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We greatly expand the application of multiphoton microscopy to geological investigations by using a tightly focused femtosecond laser beam to excite fluorescent emissions among minimally prepared rock and mineral samples. This new finding provides a tool for spatially resolving UV-visible fluorescent sources in minerals. Using a unique combination of harmonic generation and fluorescence, we explore applications to mineralogical investigations of terrestrial rocks and astromaterials. We report first-order demonstrations for 3D imaging of fluid inclusions in minerals and radiation-induced luminescence in meteorites. Nonlinear optical mineralogy, enabled by multiphoton microscopy, provides unique insights in mineralogic samples and holds the potential to revolutionize the analysis of geologic and astromaterials samples in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Information theory, Signal Analysis and Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book is intended for teaching Signal Analysis methods and Inverse Problems theory. It is completely open access and will remain free. It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. A French version is also available. The MATLAB codes we used can be found at the following address: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ndi2fs3yyup64i8xyzjqd/matlab_book.zip?rlkey=j112lo5kaxvinh362frc66bcl&amp;st=enxxx1ps&amp;dl=0</description>

      <title>Beating the aliasing limit with aperiodic monotile arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</description>

      <title>Reconciling the irreconcilable: window-based versus stochastic declustering algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-term earthquake clustering is one of the most important features of seismicity. Clusters are identified using various techniques, generally deterministic and based on spatio-temporal windowing. Conversely, the leading rail in short-term earthquake forecasting has a probabilistic view of clustering, usually based on the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models. In this study we compare seismic clusters, identified by two different deterministic window-based techniques, with the ETAS probabilities associated with any event in the clusters, thus investigating the consistency between deterministic and probabilistic approaches. The comparison is performed by considering, for each event in an identified cluster, the corresponding probability of being independent and the expected number of triggered events according to ETAS. Results show no substantial differences between the cluster identification procedures, and an overall consistency between the identified clusters and the relative events' ETAS probabilities.</description>
