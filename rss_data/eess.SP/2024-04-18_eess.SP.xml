      <title>SIFt-RLS: Subspace of Information Forgetting Recursive Least Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents subspace of information forgetting recursive least squares (SIFt-RLS), a directional forgetting algorithm which, at each step, forgets only in row space of the regressor matrix, or the \textit{information subspace}. As a result, SIFt-RLS tracks parameters that are in excited directions while not changing parameter estimation in unexcited directions. It is shown that SIFt-RLS guarantees an upper and lower bound of the covariance matrix, without assumptions of persistent excitation, and explicit bounds are given. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are given for the uniform Lyapunov stability and global uniform exponential stability of parameter estimation error in SIFt-RLS when estimating fixed parameters without noise. SIFt-RLS is compared to other RLS algorithms from the literature in a numerical example without persistently exciting data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Batch and Recursive Least Squares for Matrix Parameter Estimation with Application to Adaptive MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditionally, batch least squares (BLS) and recursive least squares (RLS) are used for identification of a vector of parameters that form a linear model. In some situations, however, it is of interest to identify parameters in a matrix structure. In this case, a common approach is to transform the problem into standard vector form using the vectorization (vec) operator and the Kronecker product, known as vec-permutation. However, the use of the Kronecker product introduces extraneous zero terms in the regressor, resulting in unnecessary additional computational and space requirements. This work derives matrix BLS and RLS formulations which, under mild assumptions, minimize the same cost as the vec-permutation approach. This new approach requires less computational complexity and space complexity than vec-permutation in both BLS and RLS identification. It is also shown that persistent excitation guarantees convergence to the true matrix parameters. This method can used to improve computation time in the online identification of multiple-input, multiple-output systems for indirect adaptive model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Beam Training in mmWave Vehicular Systems: Machine Learning for Decoupling Beam Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codebook-based beam selection is one approach for configuring millimeter wave communication links. The overhead required to reconfigure the transmit and receive beam pair, though, increases in highly dynamic vehicular communication systems. Location information coupled with machine learning (ML) beam recommendation is one way to reduce the overhead of beam pair selection. In this paper, we develop ML-based location-aided approaches to decouple the beam selection between the user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS). We quantify the performance gaps due to decoupling beam selection and also disaggregating the UE's location information from the BS. Our simulation results show that decoupling beam selection with available location information at the BS performs comparable to joint beam pair selection at the BS. Moreover, decoupled beam selection without location closely approaches the performance of beam pair selection at the BS when sufficient beam pairs are swept.</description>

      <title>Robust and tractable multidimensional exponential analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a number of applications in signal processing, we study the following question. Given samples of a multidimensional signal of the form \begin{align*} f(\bs\ell)=\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\exp(-i\langle \bs\ell, \w_k\rangle), \\ \w_1,\cdots,\w_k\in\mathbb{R}^q, \ \bs\ell\in \ZZ^q, \ |\bs\ell| &lt;n, \end{align*} determine the values of the number $K$ of components, and the parameters $a_k$ and $\w_k$'s. We develop an algorithm to recuperate these quantities accurately using only a subsample of size $\O(qn)$ of this data. For this purpose, we use a novel localized kernel method to identify the parameters, including the number $K$ of signals. Our method is easy to implement, and is shown to be stable under a very low SNR range. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting algorithm using 2 and 3 dimensional examples from the literature, and show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art techniques including Prony based, MUSIC and ESPRIT approaches.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Noise Resilience Strategies in Gesture Recognition: Short-Term Enhancement in Surface Electromyographic Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gesture recognition based on surface electromyography (sEMG) has been gaining importance in many 3D Interactive Scenes. However, sEMG is easily influenced by various forms of noise in real-world environments, leading to challenges in providing long-term stable interactions through sEMG. Existing methods often struggle to enhance model noise resilience through various predefined data augmentation techniques. In this work, we revisit the problem from a short term enhancement perspective to improve precision and robustness against various common noisy scenarios with learnable denoise using sEMG intrinsic pattern information and sliding-window attention. We propose a Short Term Enhancement Module(STEM) which can be easily integrated with various models. STEM offers several benefits: 1) Learnable denoise, enabling noise reduction without manual data augmentation; 2) Scalability, adaptable to various models; and 3) Cost-effectiveness, achieving short-term enhancement through minimal weight-sharing in an efficient attention mechanism. In particular, we incorporate STEM into a transformer, creating the Short Term Enhanced Transformer (STET). Compared with best-competing approaches, the impact of noise on STET is reduced by more than 20%. We also report promising results on both classification and regression datasets and demonstrate that STEM generalizes across different gesture recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Lower Limb Movements Recognition Based on Feature Recursive Elimination and Backpropagation Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal serve as a signal source commonly used for lower limb movement recognition, reflecting the intent of human movement. However, it has been a challenge to improve the movements recognition rate while using fewer features in this area of research area. In this paper, a method for lower limb movements recognition based on recursive feature elimination and backpropagation neural network of support vector machine is proposed. First, the sEMG signal of five subjects performing eight different lower limb movements was recorded using a BIOPAC collector. The optimal feature subset consists of 25 feature vectors, determined using a Recursive Feature Elimination based on Support Vector Machine (SVM-RFE). Finally, this study used five supervised classification algorithms to recognize these eight different lower limb movements. The results of the experimental study show that the combination of the BPNN classifier and the SVM-RFE feature selection algorithm is able to achieve an excellent action recognition accuracy of 95\%, which provides sufficient support for the feasibility of this approach.</description>

      <title>Heart Rate Variability Series is the Output of a non-Chaotic System driven by Dynamical Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) series reflects the dynamical variation of heartbeat-to-heartbeat intervals in time and is one of the outputs of the cardiovascular system. Over the years, this system has been recognized for generating nonlinear and complex heartbeat dynamics, with the latter referring to a high sensitivity to small -- theoretically infinitesimal -- input changes. While early research associated chaotic behavior with the cardiovascular system, evidence of stochastic inputs to the system, i.e., a physiological noise, invalidated those conclusions. To date, a comprehensive characterization of the cardiovascular system dynamics, accounting for dynamical noise input, has not been undertaken. In this study, we propose a novel methodological framework for evaluating the presence of regular or chaotic dynamics in noisy dynamical systems. The method relies on the estimation of asymptotic growth rate of noisy mean square displacement series in a two-dimensional phase space. We validated the proposed method using synthetic series comprising well-known regular and chaotic maps. We applied the method to real HRV series from healthy subjects, as well as patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, during unstructured long-term activity. Results indicate that HRV series are consistently generated by a regular system driven by dynamical noise.</description>

      <title>Classifying Sums of Exponentially Damped Sinusoids Using an Associated Numerical Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matrix pencil method (MPM) is a well-known technique for estimating the parameters of exponentially damped sinusoids in noise by solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. However, in several cases, this is an ill-conditioned problem whose solution is highly biased under small perturbations. When the estimation is performed to classify the observed signal into two categories, the estimation errors induce several misclassifications. In this work we propose a novel signal classification criteria by exploiting the relationship between the generalized eigenvalue problem posed in the MPM and the numerical range of a pair of rectangular matrices. In particular, the classification test is formulated as a set inclusion problem, and no spectrum estimation is required. The technique is applied to a problem of electromagnetic scattering to classify dielectric materials using the scattering signal observed when a target is illuminated by an ultra-wideband signal. The performance of the classification scheme is assessed in terms of error rate and it is compared to another classification technique, the generalized likelihood rate test (GLRT).</description>

      <title>Convergence of Recursive Least Squares Based Input/Output System Identification with Model Order Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete-time input/output models, also called infinite impulse response (IIR) models or autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models, are useful for online identification as they can be efficiently updated using recursive least squares (RLS) as new data is collected. Several works have studied the convergence of the input/output model coefficients identified using RLS under the assumption that the order of the identified model is the same as that of the true system. However, the case of model order mismatch is not as well addressed. This work begins by introducing the notion of \textit{equivalence} of input/output models of different orders. Next, this work analyzes online identification of input/output models in the case where the order of the identified model is higher than that of the true system. It is shown that, given persistently exciting data, the higher-order identified model converges to the model equivalent to the true system that minimizes the regularization term of RLS.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kalman Filtering Developed from Recursive Least Squares Forgetting Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recursive least squares (RLS) is derived as the recursive minimizer of the least-squares cost function. Moreover, it is well known that RLS is a special case of the Kalman filter. This work presents the Kalman filter least squares (KFLS) cost function, whose recursive minimizer gives the Kalman filter. KFLS is an extension of generalized forgetting recursive least squares (GF-RLS), a general framework which contains various extensions of RLS from the literature as special cases. This then implies that extensions of RLS are also special cases of the Kalman filter. Motivated by this connection, we propose an algorithm that combines extensions of RLS with the Kalman filter, resulting in a new class of adaptive Kalman filters. A numerical example shows that one such adaptive Kalman filter provides improved state estimation for a mass-spring-damper with intermittent, unmodeled collisions. This example suggests that such adaptive Kalman filtering may provide potential benefits for systems with non-classical disturbances.</description>

Abstract: Breathing monitoring is crucial in healthcare for early detection of health issues, but traditional methods face challenges like invasiveness, privacy concerns, and limited applicability in daily settings. This paper introduces light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors as a remote, privacy-respecting alternative for monitoring breathing metrics, including inhalation/exhalation patterns, respiratory rates, breath depth, and detecting breathlessness. We highlight LiDARs ability to function across various postures, presenting empirical evidence of its accuracy and reliability. Our findings position LiDAR as an innovative solution in breathing monitoring, offering significant advantages over conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Sky-GVIO: an enhanced GNSS/INS/Vision navigation with FCN-based sky-segmentation in urban canyon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate, continuous, and reliable positioning is a critical component of achieving autonomous driving. However, in complex urban canyon environments, the vulnerability of a stand-alone sensor and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) caused by high buildings, trees, and elevated structures seriously affect positioning results. To address these challenges, a sky-view images segmentation algorithm based on Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed for GNSS NLOS detection. Building upon this, a novel NLOS detection and mitigation algorithm (named S-NDM) is extended to the tightly coupled Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), and visual feature system which is called Sky-GVIO, with the aim of achieving continuous and accurate positioning in urban canyon environments. Furthermore, the system harmonizes Single Point Positioning (SPP) with Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) methodologies to bolster its operational versatility and resilience. In urban canyon environments, the positioning performance of S-NDM algorithm proposed in this paper is evaluated under different tightly coupled SPP-related and RTK-related models. The results exhibit that Sky-GVIO system achieves meter-level accuracy under SPP mode and sub-decimeter precision with RTK, surpassing the performance of GNSS/INS/Vision frameworks devoid of S-NDM. Additionally, the sky-view image dataset, inclusive of training and evaluation subsets, has been made publicly accessible for scholarly exploration at https://github.com/whuwangjr/sky-view-images .</description>

      <title>EEG_GLT-Net: Optimising EEG Graphs for Real-time Motor Imagery Signals Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces connect the brain to external control devices, necessitating the accurate translation of brain signals such as from electroencephalography (EEG) into executable commands. Graph Neural Networks (GCN) have been increasingly applied for classifying EEG Motor Imagery signals, primarily because they incorporates the spatial relationships among EEG channels, resulting in improved accuracy over traditional convolutional methods. Recent advances by GCNs-Net in real-time EEG MI signal classification utilised Pearson Coefficient Correlation (PCC) for constructing adjacency matrices, yielding significant results on the PhysioNet dataset. Our paper introduces the EEG Graph Lottery Ticket (EEG_GLT) algorithm, an innovative technique for constructing adjacency matrices for EEG channels. It does not require pre-existing knowledge of inter-channel relationships, and it can be tailored to suit both individual subjects and GCN model architectures. Our findings demonstrated that the PCC method outperformed the Geodesic approach by 9.65% in mean accuracy, while our EEG_GLT matrix consistently exceeded the performance of the PCC method by a mean accuracy of 13.39%. Also, we found that the construction of the adjacency matrix significantly influenced accuracy, to a greater extent than GCN model configurations. A basic GCN configuration utilising our EEG_GLT matrix exceeded the performance of even the most complex GCN setup with a PCC matrix in average accuracy. Our EEG_GLT method also reduced MACs by up to 97% compared to the PCC method, while maintaining or enhancing accuracy. In conclusion, the EEG_GLT algorithm marks a breakthrough in the development of optimal adjacency matrices, effectively boosting both computational accuracy and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time classification of EEG MI signals that demand intensive computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microwave photonic short-time Fourier transform (STFT) system based on stabilized period-one (P1) nonlinear laser dynamics and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is proposed. By using an optoelectronic feedback loop, the frequency-sweep optical signal generated by the P1 nonlinear laser dynamics is stabilized, which is further used in conjunction with an optical bandpass filter implemented by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) to achieve the frequency-to-time mapping of microwave signals and the final STFT. By comparing the experimental results with and without optoelectronic feedback, it is found that the time-frequency diagram of the signal under test (SUT) obtained by STFT is clearer and more regular, and the frequency of the SUT measured in each frequency-sweep period is more accurate. The mean absolute error is reduced by 50% under the optimal filter bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Personalized Heart Disease Detection via ECG Digital Twin Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heart diseases rank among the leading causes of global mortality, demonstrating a crucial need for early diagnosis and intervention. Most traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) based automated diagnosis methods are trained at population level, neglecting the customization of personalized ECGs to enhance individual healthcare management. A potential solution to address this limitation is to employ digital twins to simulate symptoms of diseases in real patients. In this paper, we present an innovative prospective learning approach for personalized heart disease detection, which generates digital twins of healthy individuals' anomalous ECGs and enhances the model sensitivity to the personalized symptoms. In our approach, a vector quantized feature separator is proposed to locate and isolate the disease symptom and normal segments in ECG signals with ECG report guidance. Thus, the ECG digital twins can simulate specific heart diseases used to train a personalized heart disease detection model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach not only excels in generating high-fidelity ECG signals but also improves personalized heart disease detection. Moreover, our approach ensures robust privacy protection, safeguarding patient data in model development.</description>

      <title>2 $\mu$m Watt-level Fiber Amplifiers, Lasers, and ASE Sources Pumped by Broadband ASE Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the design and demonstration of novel 2 $\mu$m band Watt-level fiber amplifiers, fiber lasers, and wideband ASE sources that are pumped with broad spectrum Watt-level ASE sources instead of conventional fiber laser pumps. We show good agreement between the simulations and experimental results for the performance of a single-stage Ho-doped fiber amplifier at 2050nm wavelength pumped by a 50 nm broadband Tm-doped ASE source centered at 1860 nm. Next, we show that the new ASE pumping approach works effectively for a two -stage Ho-doped fiber amplifier as for a single stage Ho-doped fiber amplifier. Then, we demonstrate successfully the pumping of a Tm-doped fiber laser at 2039 nm using an ASE source centered at 1550 nm. Finally, we produce a novel 265 nm wide broadband ASE source at 2 $\mu$m by concatenating Tm and Ho ASE sources. Our ASE-based pumping approach is simple and versatile compared to the standard laser based pumping means, and leads to similar device performance.</description>

      <title>Destructive and constructive RIS beamforming in an ISAC-multi-user MIMO network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has already established itself as a promising solution to the spectrum scarcity problem, even more so when paired with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) as RISs can shape the propagation environment by adjusting their phase-shift coefficients. Albeit the potential performance gain, a RIS also poses a security threat to the system: in this paper, we explore both sides of the RIS presence in a multi-user MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) ISAC network. We first develop an alternating optimization algorithm, obtaining the active and passive beamforming vectors maximizing the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints for the communication users and finite power budget. We also investigate the destructive potential of RIS by devising a RIS phase-shift optimization algorithm that minimizes sensing SNR while preserving the same minimum communication SINR previously guaranteed by the system. We further investigate the impact of the RIS's individual element failures on the system performances. The simulation results show that the RIS performance-boosting potential is as good as its destructive one and that both of our optimization strategies show some resilience towards the investigated impairments.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Learning via Regularization, Confidence Minimization, and Selective Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) models in fields such as engineering is limited by the known difficulty of quantifying the reliability of an AI's decision. A well-calibrated AI model must correctly report its accuracy on in-distribution (ID) inputs, while also enabling the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. A conventional approach to improve calibration is the application of Bayesian ensembling. However, owing to computational limitations and model misspecification, practical ensembling strategies do not necessarily enhance calibration. This paper proposes an extension of variational inference (VI)-based Bayesian learning that integrates calibration regularization for improved ID performance, confidence minimization for OOD detection, and selective calibration to ensure a synergistic use of calibration regularization and confidence minimization. The scheme is constructed successively by first introducing calibration-regularized Bayesian learning (CBNN), then incorporating out-of-distribution confidence minimization (OCM) to yield CBNN-OCM, and finally integrating also selective calibration to produce selective CBNN-OCM (SCBNN-OCM). Selective calibration rejects inputs for which the calibration performance is expected to be insufficient. Numerical results illustrate the trade-offs between ID accuracy, ID calibration, and OOD calibration attained by both frequentist and Bayesian learning methods. Among the main conclusions, SCBNN-OCM is seen to achieve best ID and OOD performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches at the cost of rejecting a sufficiently large number of inputs.</description>

      <title>The LuViRA Dataset: Measurement Description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dataset to evaluate localization algorithms, which utilizes vision, audio, and radio sensors: the Lund University Vision, Radio, and Audio (LuViRA) Dataset. The dataset includes RGB images, corresponding depth maps, IMU readings, channel response between a massive MIMO channel sounder and a user equipment, audio recorded by 12 microphones, and 0.5 mm accurate 6DoF pose ground truth. We synchronize these sensors to make sure that all data are recorded simultaneously. A camera, speaker, and transmit antenna are placed on top of a slowly moving service robot and 88 trajectories are recorded. Each trajectory includes 20 to 50 seconds of recorded sensor data and ground truth labels. The data from different sensors can be used separately or jointly to conduct localization tasks and a motion capture system is used to verify the results obtained by the localization algorithms. The main aim of this dataset is to enable research on fusing the most commonly used sensors for localization tasks. However, the full dataset or some parts of it can also be used for other research areas such as channel estimation, image classification, etc. Fusing sensor data can lead to increased localization accuracy and reliability, as well as decreased latency and power consumption. The created dataset will be made public at a later date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02234v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel technique called "Forged Channel," which aims to comprehensively represent EEG signals in order to achieve accurate classification of Parkinson's disease. The forged channel method prepares EEG signals in a manner that allows a deep learning model to effectively perceive all EEG channels within a single input. By employing this approach alongside a convolutional neural network, an impressive accuracy of 90.32% was achieved using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. This performance closely reflects real-world conditions, highlighting the superiority of our method compared to similar approaches.</description>

      <title>CASTER: A Computer-Vision-Assisted Wireless Channel Simulator for Gesture Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a computer-vision-assisted simulation method is proposed to address the issue of training dataset acquisition for wireless hand gesture recognition. In the existing literature, in order to classify gestures via the wireless channel estimation, massive training samples should be measured in a consistent environment, consuming significant efforts. In the proposed CASTER simulator, however, the training dataset can be simulated via existing videos. Particularly, a gesture is represented by a sequence of snapshots, and the channel impulse response of each snapshot is calculated via tracing the rays scattered off a primitive-based hand model. Moreover, CASTER simulator relies on the existing videos to extract the motion data of gestures. Thus, the massive measurements of wireless channel can be eliminated. The experiments demonstrate a 90.8% average classification accuracy of simulation-to-reality inference.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Expectation-Maximization Algorithm with Mixed-Integer Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence of expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithms typically requires continuity of the likelihood function with respect to all the unknown parameters (optimization variables). The requirement is not met when parameters comprise both discrete and continuous variables, making the convergence analysis nontrivial. This paper introduces a set of conditions that ensure the convergence of a specific class of EM algorithms that estimate a mixture of discrete and continuous parameters. Our results offer a new analysis technique for iterative algorithms that solve mixed-integer non-linear optimization problems. As a concrete example, we prove the convergence of the EM-based sparse Bayesian learning algorithm in [1] that estimates the state of a linear dynamical system with jointly sparse inputs and bursty missing observations. Our results establish that the algorithm in [1] converges to the set of stationary points of the maximum likelihood cost with respect to the continuous optimization variables.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation in Dual-Band XL-MIMO with Side Information-Assisted Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Near-field communication comes to be an indispensable part of the future sixth generation (6G) communications at the arrival of the forth-coming deployment of extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Due to the substantial number of antennas, the electromagnetic radiation field is modeled by the spherical waves instead of the conventional planar waves, leading to severe weak sparsity to angular-domain near-field channel. Therefore, the channel estimation reminiscent of the conventional compression sensing (CS) approaches in the angular domain, judiciously utilized for low pilot overhead, may result in unprecedented challenges. To this end, this paper proposes a brand-new near-field channel estimation scheme by exploiting the naturally occurring useful side information. Specifically, we formulate the dual-band near-field communication model based on the fact that high-frequency systems are likely to be deployed with lower-frequency systems. Representative side information, i.e., the structural characteristic information derived by the sparsity ambiguity and the out-of-band spatial information stemming from the lower-frequency channel, is explored and tailored to materialize exceptional near-field channel estimation. Furthermore, in-depth theoretical analyses are developed to guarantee the minimum estimation error, based on which a suite of algorithms leveraging the elaborating side information are proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the designed algorithms provide more assured results than the off-the-shelf approaches in the context of the dual-band near-field communications in both on- and off-grid scenarios, where the angle of departures/arrivals are discretely or continuously distributed, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have expanded the current status of semantic communication limited to processing one task to a more general system that can handle multiple tasks concurrently. In pursuit of this, we first introduced our definition of the "semantic source", enabling the interpretation of multiple semantics based on a single observation. A semantic encoder design is then introduced, featuring the division of the encoder into a common unit and multiple specific units enabling cooperative multi-task processing. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semantic source and the system design. Our approach employs information maximization (infomax) and end-to-end design principles.</description>

      <title>Bridging the complexity gap in Tbps-achieving THz-band baseband processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in electronic and photonic technologies have allowed efficient signal generation and transmission at terahertz (THz) frequencies. However, as the gap in THz-operating devices narrows, the demand for terabit-per-second (Tbps)-achieving circuits is increasing. Translating the available hundreds of gigahertz (GHz) of bandwidth into a Tbps data rate requires processing thousands of information bits per clock cycle at state-of-the-art clock frequencies of digital baseband processing circuitry of a few GHz. This paper addresses these constraints and emphasizes the importance of parallelization in signal processing, particularly for channel code decoding. By leveraging structured sub-spaces of THz channels, we propose mapping bits to transmission resources using shorter code-words, extending parallelizability across all baseband processing blocks. THz channels exhibit quasi-deterministic frequency, time, and space structures that enable efficient parallel bit mapping at the source and provide pseudo-soft bit reliability information for efficient detection and decoding at the receiver.</description>

      <title>DiffDet4SAR: Diffusion-based Aircraft Target Detection Network for SAR Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aircraft target detection in SAR images is a challenging task due to the discrete scattering points and severe background clutter interference. Currently, methods with convolution-based or transformer-based paradigms cannot adequately address these issues. In this letter, we explore diffusion models for SAR image aircraft target detection for the first time and propose a novel \underline{Diff}usion-based aircraft target \underline{Det}ection network \underline{for} \underline{SAR} images (DiffDet4SAR). Specifically, the proposed DiffDet4SAR yields two main advantages for SAR aircraft target detection: 1) DiffDet4SAR maps the SAR aircraft target detection task to a denoising diffusion process of bounding boxes without heuristic anchor size selection, effectively enabling large variations in aircraft sizes to be accommodated; and 2) the dedicatedly designed Scattering Feature Enhancement (SFE) module further reduces the clutter intensity and enhances the target saliency during inference. Extensive experimental results on the SAR-AIRcraft-1.0 dataset show that the proposed DiffDet4SAR achieves 88.4\% mAP$_{50}$, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 6\%.
