      <title>Generative Modeling and Decision Fusion for Unknown Event Detection and Classification Using Synchrophasor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable detection and classification of power system events are critical for maintaining grid stability and situational awareness. Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines. The ability to recognize unknown events further highlights the adaptability and practical value of the proposed approach for wide-area event analysis in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Introducing Multimodal Paradigm for Learning Sleep Staging PSG via General-Purpose Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep staging is essential for diagnosing sleep disorders and assessing neurological health. Existing automatic methods typically extract features from complex polysomnography (PSG) signals and train domain-specific models, which often lack intuitiveness and require large, specialized datasets. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm for sleep staging that leverages large multimodal general-purpose models to emulate clinical diagnostic practices. Specifically, we convert raw one-dimensional PSG time-series into intuitive two-dimensional waveform images and then fine-tune a multimodal large model to learn from these representations. Experiments on three public datasets (ISRUC, MASS, SHHS) demonstrate that our approach enables general-purpose models, without prior exposure to sleep data, to acquire robust staging capabilities. Moreover, explanation analysis reveals our model learned to mimic the visual diagnostic workflow of human experts for sleep staging by PSG images. The proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and robustness, highlighting its efficiency and practical value for medical applications. The code for the signal-to-image pipeline and the PSG image dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>Scalable Wi-Fi RSS-Based Indoor Localization via Automatic Vision-Assisted Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi-based positioning promises a scalable and privacy-preserving solution for location-based services in indoor environments such as malls, airports, and campuses. RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting (x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization, validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use. All code, tools, and datasets are released as open source.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation, which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation in Cooperative Mid-band/THz Networks in the Presence of Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive framework to investigate and optimize the downlink performance of cooperative multi-band networks (MBNs) operating on upper mid-band (UMB) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, where base stations (BSs) in each band cooperatively serve users. The framework captures sophisticated features such as near-field channel modeling, fully and partially connected antenna architectures, and users' mobility. First, we consider joint user association and hybrid beamforming optimization to maximize the system sum-rate, subject to power constraints, maximum cluster size of cooperating BSs, and users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. By leveraging fractional programming FP and majorization-minimization techniques, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem. We then consider handover (HO)-aware resource allocation for moving users in a cooperative UMB/THz MBN. Two HO-aware resource allocation methods are proposed. The first method focuses on maximizing the HO-aware system sum-rate subject to HO-aware QoS constraints. Using Jensen's inequality and properties of logarithmic functions, the non-convex optimization problem is tightly approximated with a convex one and solved. The second method addresses a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate, while minimizing the total number of HOs. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms, cooperative UMB/THz MBN over stand-alone THz networks, as well as the critical importance of accurate near-field modeling in extremely large antenna arrays. Moreover, the proposed HO-aware resource allocation methods effectively mitigate the impact of HOs, enhancing performance in the considered system.</description>

      <title>Dual-Function Beam Pattern Design for Multi-Target ISAC Systems: A Decoupled Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the beampattern design problem for mono-static multi-user (MU) multi-point-target integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a dual-function multiple-input multiple-output (DF-MIMO) base station (BS) performs downlink communication and radar sensing simultaneously. In ISAC systems, sensing and communication inherently compete for resources. As communication demand increases, the beam pattern is reshaped, which might degrade the direction of arrival (DoA) sensing accuracy, measured in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and lower-bounded by the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Since conventional joint formulations of the sensing-based problem often overlook this trade-off, our work addresses it by decomposing the sensing-based problem into two subproblems (SPs). This decomposition enables a more effective exploitation of the beam pattern's physical properties, which we refer to as the Sensing-Guided Communication Dual-Function (SGCDF) beam pattern design. We further develop a low-complexity extension using the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO) and convex closed-set projection. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method improves multi-target estimation accuracy, compared to traditional joint optimization strategies, by preserving the beam pattern, while the low-complexity version offers an excellent performance-complexity tradeoff, maintaining high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>HoloTrace: a Location Privacy Preservation Solution for mmWave MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technological innovation towards 6G cellular networks introduces unprecedented capabilities for user equipment (UE) localization, but it also raises serious concerns about physical layer location privacy. This paper introduces HoloTrace, a signal-level privacy preservation framework that relies on user-side spoofing of localization-relevant features to prevent the extraction of precise location information from the signals received by a base station (BS) in a mmWave MIMO-OFDM system. Spoofing is performed by the user on location parameters such as angle of arrival (AoA), angle of departure (AoD), and time difference of arrival (TDoA). Without requiring any protocol modification nor network-side support, our method strategically perturbs pilot transmissions to prevent a BS from performing non-consensual UE localization. The methodology allows the UE to spoof its position, keeping the precoder unchanged. We formulate spoofing as a unified rank-constrained projection problem, and provide closed-form solutions under varying levels of channel state information (CSI) at the UE, including scenarios with and without CSI knowledge. Simulation results confirm that the proposed approach enables the UE to deceive the BS, inducing significant localization errors, while the impact on link capacity varies depending on the spoofed position. Our findings establish HoloTrace as a practical and robust privacy-preserving solution for future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Theoretical framework of passive ME antenna arrays enabling in-vivo monitoring: A pathway to smart implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new brain-computer interface (BCI) technology, deployed through minimally invasive surgery, is changing the way we think about treating severe neurological conditions. The central idea is to place a device called Stentrode in the brain's vasculature, which enables neuromodulation and helps patients regain the ability to communicate. However, in such devices, the battery and electronics are wired and could introduce damage or implant malfunction. In these cases, a Stentrode integrated with magnetoelectric (ME) antennas could be of great interest. ME antennas offer significant advantages over traditional antennas, leveraging acoustic resonance rather than electromagnetic resonance to achieve a size reduction of up to five orders of magnitude. In addition to their compactness and immunity to ground-plane interference, ME antennas could be adopted for use in vascular implants, such as coronary stents, potentially enabling minimally invasive monitoring and communication. Despite these advantages, a single antenna embedded in the implant may be constrained by the limited volume of magnetostrictive material, which could result in low output gain. To address this gain limitation, we propose using antenna arrays designed to produce constructive interference at a designated far-field point, ideally located outside the patient, to enhance signal transmission and receiving capabilities. We develop a mathematical model to represent the antennas and optimize their spatial arrangement and phase synchronization. Simulations based on this model demonstrate promising high-gain performance at the prescribed far-field location through phase manipulation.</description>

      <title>Learnable Kernels for FRI - Joint Kernel Encoder Optimization and Hardware Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI) sampling techniques provide efficient frameworks for reconstructing signals with inherent sparsity at rates below Nyquist. However, traditional FRI reconstruction methods rely heavily on pre-defined kernels, often limiting hardware implementation and reconstruction accuracy under noisy conditions. In this paper, we propose a robust, flexible, and practically implementable framework for FRI reconstruction by introducing novel learnable kernel strategies. First, we demonstrate effective reconstruction using known, fixed kernels such as truncated Gaussian and Gaussian pair kernels, which mitigate the requirement that the samples should have a sum-of-exponentials (SoE) form. Next, we extend this concept by jointly optimizing both the sampling kernel and reconstruction encoder through a unified learning approach, yielding adaptive kernels that significantly outperform traditional methods in resolution and noise robustness, with reduced sampling rates. Furthermore, we propose a practical hardware realization by representing kernels as sums of two exponential decay signals with jointly optimized poles, facilitating compact, efficient analog implementations. Our approach is validated experimentally through hardware implementations using a unity-gain Sallen-Key analog filter, achieving accurate real-world signal recovery. The developed convolutional neural network-based encoder substantially reduces computational complexity, demonstrating competitive performance with fewer parameters, making our method particularly suitable for resource-constrained, edge-based deployments.</description>

      <title>Joint Hybrid Beamforming and Artificial Noise Design for Secure Multi-UAV ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerges as a key enabler for next-generation applications such as smart cities and autonomous systems. Its integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) unlocks new potentials for reliable communication and precise sensing in dynamic aerial environments. However, existing research predominantly treats UAVs as aerial base stations, overlooking their role as ISAC users, and fails to leverage large-scale antenna arrays at terrestrial base stations to enhance security and spectral efficiency. This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Expectation Propagation-Based Signal Detection for Highly Correlated MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems typically operate in dense array deployments with limited scattering environments, leading to highly correlated and ill-conditioned channel matrices that severely degrade the performance of message-passing-based detectors. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes an expectation propagation (EP)-based detector, termed overlapping block partitioning EP (OvEP). In OvEP, the large-scale measurement vector is partitioned into partially overlapping blocks. For each block and its overlapping part, a low-complexity linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based filter is designed according to the partitioned structure. The resulting LMMSE outputs are then combined to generate the input to the denoiser. In this combining process, subtracting the overlapping-part outputs from the block outputs effectively mitigates the adverse effects of inter-block correlation induced by high spatial correlation. The proposed algorithm is consistently derived within the EP framework, and its fixed point is theoretically proven to coincide with the stationary point of a relaxed Kullback- Leibler (KL) minimization problem. The mechanisms underlying the theoretically predicted performance improvement are further clarified through numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm achieves performance close to conventional LMMSE-EP with lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Online Specific Emitter Identification via Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) has been widely studied, aiming to distinguish signals from different emitters given training samples from those emitters. However, real-world scenarios often require identifying signals from novel emitters previously unseen. Since these novel emitters only have a few or no prior samples, existing models struggle to identify signals from novel emitters online and tend to bias toward the distribution of seen emitters. To address these challenges, we propose the Online Specific Emitter Identification (OSEI) task, comprising both online \revise{few-shot and generalized zero-shot} learning tasks. It requires constructing models using signal samples from seen emitters and then identifying new samples from seen and novel emitters online during inference. We propose a novel hash-based model, Collision-Alleviated Signal Hash (CASH), providing a unified approach for addressing the OSEI task. The CASH operates in two steps: in the seen emitters identifying step, a signal encoder and a seen emitters identifier determine whether the signal sample is from seen emitters, mitigating the model from biasing toward seen emitters distribution. In the signal hash coding step, an online signal hasher assigns a hash code to each signal sample, identifying its specific emitter. Experimental results on real-world signal datasets (i.e., ADSB and ORACLE) demonstrate that our method accurately identifies signals from both seen and novel emitters online. This model outperforms existing methods by a minimum of 6.08\% and 8.55\% in accuracy for the few-shot and \revise{generalized zero-shot learning }tasks, respectively. The code will be open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/IntelliSensing/OSEI-CASH}{https://github.com/IntelliSensing/OSEI-CASH}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion for Nonlinear Filtering in the Small System Noise Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new asymptotic expansion method for nonlinear filtering, based on a small parameter in the system noise. The conditional expectation is expanded as a power series in the noise level, with each coefficient computed by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. This approach mitigates the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy inherent in existing methods such as Gaussian approximations and particle filters. Moreover, by incorporating an Edgeworth-type expansion, our method captures complex features of the conditional distribution, such as multimodality, with significantly lower computational cost than conventional filtering algorithms.</description>

      <title>Wideband Integrated Sensing and Communications: Spectral Efficiency and Signaling Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), a distinguishing feature of 6G wireless networks, the main challenge lies in integrating the two distinct functions of sensing and communication within the same waveform. In this paper, the ISAC waveform synthesis is studied in the wideband regime, since a large bandwidth can simplify the analysis and is justified by the employment of millimeter wave or higher frequency band. Standard orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling is assumed, and the wideband analysis of sensing is a counterpart of the existing studies on wideband communications. It is proposed that the phase over such OFDM subcarriers is for modulating communication messages while the power spectral density (PSD) is shaped for the sensing performance. Beyond OFDM, we further reveal a duality between the proposed PSD-shaping rule and the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform. Flattening the OTFS delay-axis PSD produces the same integrated sidelobe level (ISL) reduction effect in the delay-Doppler domain as PSD control achieves for OFDM in the frequency domain. To balance communication and sensing performance over frequency-selective channels, we propose a low-complexity, water-filling-like allocator with an explicit PSD-flatness (variance) constraint. The performance of the proposed wideband ISAC scheme is demonstrated using both numerical simulations and hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>BladderFormer: A Streaming Transformer for Real-Time Urological State Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bladder pressure monitoring systems are increasingly vital in diagnosing and managing urinary tract dysfunction. Existing solutions rely heavily on hand-crafted features and shallow classifiers, limiting their adaptability to complex signal dynamics. We propose a one-layer streaming transformer model for real-time classification of bladder pressure states, operating on wavelet-transformed representations of raw time-series data. Our model incorporates temporal multi-head self-attention and state caching, enabling efficient online inference with high adaptability. Trained on a dataset of 91 patients with 20,000-80,000 samples each, our method demonstrates improved accuracy, higher energy- and latency-efficiency. Implementation considerations for edge deployment on low-power hardware, such as edge graphical processing units (GPU) and micro-controllers, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.</description>

      <title>N78 Frequency Band Modular RIS Design and Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), capable of dynamically controlling wireless propagation characteristics using reflecting antenna elements, is a promising technology for enhancing signal coverage and improving end-user connectivity in next-generation wireless networks. This paper presents a complete design flow of a modular RIS prototype operating at the n78 frequency band, starting from the simulations to the prototype development and testing. An RIS prototype includes one master and up to sixteen slave blocks, each of which has an identical hardware structure with $8\times 8$ reflecting surface elements and a controller board. The phase shift response of each unit element is controlled with a PIN diode to form a $180^\circ$ phase difference between the ON and OFF states. The measurement experiment using two RIS blocks, horn antennas, and a vector network analyzer showed that the improvement of the received signal power is more than $15$ dB across the n78 frequency band for a given placement.</description>

      <title>Strong Basin of Attraction for Unmixing Kernels With the Variable Projection Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of recovering a mixture of spike signals convolved with distinct point spread functions (PSFs) lying on a parametric manifold, under the assumption that the spike locations are known, is studied. The PSF unmixing problem is formulated as a projected non-linear least squares estimator. A lower bound on the radius of the region of strong convexity is established in the presence of noise as a function of the manifold coherence and Lipschitz properties, guaranteeing convergence and stability of the optimization program. Numerical experiments highlight the speed of decay of the PSF class in the problem's conditioning and confirm theoretical findings. Finally, the proposed estimator is deployed on real-world spectroscopic data from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), removing the need for manual calibration and validating the method's practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Wireless Multi-Port Sensing by Multiplexed De-Embedding of an Over-the-Air Fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless multi-port sensing remotely retrieves the scattering matrix of a multi-port device under test (DUT) connected to a set of not-directly-accessible (NDA) antennas that couple over-the-air (OTA) to a set of accessible antennas. If (i) the OTA fixture characteristics are known, and (ii) the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas is sufficient, the OTA fixture can be de-embedded to recover the DUT characteristics. In recent prior work, we solved (i) by connecting the NDA antennas to a specific known tunable load network (TLN). Here, we tackle (ii) by additionally using the TLN to provide measurement diversity. The connection between OTA fixture and TLN constitutes a programmable fixture (PF). When the DUT characteristics cannot be identified based on a single PF realization, we add measurement diversity with multiple PF realizations. The underlying "multiplexed de-embedding" achieves the joint de-embedding of an ensemble of PF realizations when a single PF realization cannot be de-embedded. We experimentally demonstrate our concept by remotely estimating the scattering matrix of a reciprocal, non-unitary 4-port DUT (10 complex-valued unknowns) via a rich-scattering OTA fixture purely based on measurements of a single transmission coefficient between two accessible antennas across 30 different PF realizations. We systematically study the trade-off between the number of independent measurements at the accessible antennas and the number of PF realizations. Multiplexed de-embedding of the OTA fixture paves the path to implementing wireless multi-port sensing with low hardware complexity in areas like RFID and wireless bioelectronics.</description>

      <title>BARProp: Fast-Converging and Memory-Efficient RSS-Based Localization Algorithm for IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging received signal strength (RSS) measurements for indoor localization is highly attractive due to their inherent availability in ubiquitous wireless protocols. However, prevailing RSS-based methods often depend on complex computational algorithms or specialized hardware, rendering them impractical for low-cost access points. To address these challenges, this paper introduces buffer-aided RMSProp (BARProp), a fast and memory-efficient localization algorithm specifically designed for RSS-based tasks. The key innovation of BARProp lies in a novel mechanism that dynamically adapts the decay factor by monitoring the energy variations of recent gradients stored in a buffer, thereby achieving both accelerated convergence and enhanced stability. Furthermore, BARProp requires less than 15% of the memory used by state-of-the-art methods. Extensive evaluations with real-world data demonstrate that BARProp not only achieves higher localization accuracy but also delivers at least a fourfold improvement in convergence speed compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Impedance Modeling of Magnetometers: A Path Toward Low-Noise Readout Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing sensor readout schemes and integrated circuit designs for both open-loop and closed-loop implementations requires precise modeling and simulation strategies. This study introduces a novel two-port impedance model to estimate the behavior of a converse Magnetoelectric (cME) sensor. This model provides a possible framework for calculating transfer functions and simulating magnetometer behavior in both continuous- and discrete-time simulation environments, and it is also possibly transferable to other magnetometer types. Common S-parameters were measured experimentally using an impedance analyzer and converted to Z-parameters to create a transfer function for system-level simulations. The model was validated through an analysis of output-related noise using MATLAB and LTSpice simulations to optimize the noise of the analog circuit parts of the system. The simulation results were compared with experimental measurements using a Zurich Instruments lock-in amplifier and the custom-designed low-noise printed circuit board (PCB) under model considerations. The proposed methodology derives noise considerations and the transfer function of a magnetometer. These are essential for readout schemes for mixed-signal circuit design. This allows low-noise electronics to be designed and extended to other sensor interface electronics, broadening their applicability in high-performance magnetic sensing.</description>

      <title>RDD: Pareto Analysis of the Rate-Distortion-Distinguishability Trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive monitoring systems generate data that is usually compressed for network transmission. This compressed data might then be processed in the cloud for tasks such as anomaly detection. However, compression can potentially impair the detector's ability to distinguish between regular and irregular patterns due to information loss. Here we extend the information-theoretic framework introduced in [1] to simultaneously address the trade-off between the three features on which the effectiveness of the system depends: the effectiveness of compression, the amount of distortion it introduces, and the distinguishability between compressed normal signals and compressed anomalous signals. We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Optimization of Wireless Access Point Deployment for Communication-Based Train Control Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control (CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions, significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling, and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity receiver design for multicarrier continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems operating over doubly-dispersive (DD) channels. The receiver leverages a Gaussian Belief Propagation (GaBP)-based framework that hinges only on element-wise scalar operations for the detection of the transmitted symbols. Simulation results for the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) waveforms demonstrate significant performance improvements in terms of uncoded bit error rate (BER) compared to conventional discrete antenna array systems, while maintaining very low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking ECG Foundational Models: A Reality Check Across Clinical Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a long-standing diagnostic tool. Yet machine learning for ECG interpretation remains fragmented, often limited to narrow tasks or datasets. Foundation models promise broader adaptability, but their generalization across diverse ECG tasks is not well understood. We benchmarked eight ECG foundation models on 26 clinically relevant tasks using 12 public datasets comprising 1,650 regression and classification targets. Models were evaluated under fine-tuning and frozen settings, with scaling analyses across dataset sizes. Results show heterogeneous performance across domains: in the most widely studied domain, adult ECG interpretation, three foundation models consistently outperformed strong supervised baselines. In contrast, ECG-CPC, a compact structured state-space model pretrained on HEEDB, dominated other categories where most foundation models failed to surpass supervised learning. Foundation models also displayed distinct scaling behaviors with dataset size, which are critical for small-scale clinical applications. Overall, while foundation models show promise for adult ECG analysis, substantial gaps remain in cardiac structure, outcome prediction, and patient characterization. Notably, ECG-CPC's strong performance despite being orders of magnitude smaller and consuming minimal computational resources highlights untapped opportunities for advancing ECG foundation models.</description>

      <title>Safe Task Space Synchronization with Time-Delayed Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with safety constraints.</description>

      <title>A Generative Model for Controllable Feature Heterophily in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a principled generative framework for graph signals that enables explicit control of feature heterophily, a key property underlying the effectiveness of graph learning methods. Our model combines a Lipschitz graphon-based random graph generator with Gaussian node features filtered through a smooth spectral function of the rescaled Laplacian. We establish new theoretical guarantees: (i) a concentration result for the empirical heterophily score; and (ii) almost-sure convergence of the feature heterophily measure to a deterministic functional of the graphon degree profile, based on a graphon-limit law for polynomial averages of Laplacian eigenvalues. These results elucidate how the interplay between the graphon and the filter governs the limiting level of feature heterophily, providing a tunable mechanism for data modeling and generation. We validate the theory through experiments demonstrating precise control of homophily across graph families and spectral filters.</description>

      <title>RIS- and Multi-Snapshot-Enabled SISO 3D Position and Velocity Estimation With Single Base Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) panels can act as cost-effective anchors for radio localization, complementing conventional base station (BS) anchors. This paper investigates joint three-dimensional position and velocity estimation (3D-JPVE) in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one BS available. We first theoretically show that 3D-JPVE is infeasible when relying solely on a single RIS or on multiple snapshots alone. To address this, we propose combining RIS deployment with multi-snapshot utilization to enable realizable 3D-JPVE. A two-stage method is developed for multi-snapshot channel parameter estimation, comprising a tensor-based coarse estimation step followed by a maximum likelihood refinement step. In particular, we introduce a third-order tensor formulation to decompose the challenging 3D joint angle-of-departure and Doppler shift estimation (3D-JADE) into two tractable subproblems, which are jointly solved via a low-complexity alternating optimization approach. Building on the channel parameter estimates, we further design a two-stage low-complexity method for optimal 3D-JPVE: coarse estimation is obtained from differential measurements through linear equations, and the preliminary results are refined iteratively using the original measurements. Moreover, we derive the closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and show that the proposed 3D-JPVE method approaches CRLB-level accuracy. Simulation results confirm the statistical efficiency of the proposed estimators and demonstrate substantial 3D-JPVE performance gains when deploying active RIS compared to passive RIS.</description>

Abstract: Text-to-music models have revolutionized the creative landscape, offering new possibilities for music creation. Yet their integration into musicians workflows remains underexplored. This paper presents a case study on how TTM models impact music production, based on a user study of their effect on producers creative workflows. Participants produce tracks using a custom tool combining TTM and source separation models. Semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis reveal key challenges, opportunities, and ethical considerations. The findings offer insights into the transformative potential of TTMs in music production, as well as challenges in their real-world integration.</description>

      <title>S$^3$F-Net: A Multi-Modal Approach to Medical Image Classification via Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>AudioFuse: Unified Spectral-Temporal Learning via a Hybrid ViT-1D CNN Architecture for Robust Phonocardiogram Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical audio signals, such as phonocardiograms (PCG), are inherently rhythmic and contain diagnostic information in both their spectral (tonal) and temporal domains. Standard 2D spectrograms provide rich spectral features but compromise the phase information and temporal precision of the 1D waveform. We propose AudioFuse, an architecture that simultaneously learns from both complementary representations to classify PCGs. To mitigate the overfitting risk common in fusion models, we integrate a custom, wide-and-shallow Vision Transformer (ViT) for spectrograms with a shallow 1D CNN for raw waveforms. On the PhysioNet 2016 dataset, AudioFuse achieves a state-of-the-art competitive ROC-AUC of 0.8608 when trained from scratch, outperforming its spectrogram (0.8066) and waveform (0.8223) baselines. Moreover, it demonstrates superior robustness to domain shift on the challenging PASCAL dataset, maintaining an ROC-AUC of 0.7181 while the spectrogram baseline collapses (0.4873). Fusing complementary representations thus provides a strong inductive bias, enabling the creation of efficient, generalizable classifiers without requiring large-scale pre-training.</description>

      <title>Eye-Tracking and BCI Integration for Assistive Communication in Locked-In Syndrome: Pilot Study with Healthy Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) progressively lose voluntary motor control, often leading to a Locked-In State (LIS), or in severe cases, a Completely Locked-in State (CLIS). Eye-tracking (ET) systems are common communication tools in early LIS but become ineffective as oculomotor function declines. EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a non-muscular communication alternative, but delayed adoption may reduce performance due to diminished goal-directed thinking. This study presents a preliminary hybrid BCI framework combining ET and BCI to support a gradual transition between modalities. A group of five healthy participants tested a modified P300-based BCI. Gaze and EEG data were processed in real time, and an ET-BCI fusion algorithm was proposed to enhance detection of user intention. Results indicate that combining both modalities may maintain high accuracy and offers insights on how to potentially improve communication continuity for patients transitioning from LIS to CLIS.</description>

      <title>EEG-Based Framework for Reflexive and Perceptual Assessment in CLIS: Preliminary Study in Healthy Volunteers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the general assumption that completely locked-in state (CLIS) patients remain conscious and aware of their environment, the effectiveness of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in facilitating communication has been limited, as reported both in the literature and in our own findings. This limitation is likely attributable to impairments in executive functions, working memory, and vigilance, which appear to hinder the establishment of reliable BCI-based communication. The main goal of this research is to develop a neurophysiological report designed to support the evaluation of the cognitive state of these individuals and determine their ability to interact with BCIs. To achieve this, we designed a set of paradigms to assess CLIS patients at the reflexive and perceptual levels, based on neural responses associated with sensory and perceptual processing, including Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Steady State Auditory Evoked Potential (SSAEP), and Steady State Visual Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Pilot testing with five healthy participants demonstrates the feasibility of generating a neurophysiological report for cognitive assessment at both levels.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Based Adaptive Semantic Image Transmission for Dynamic Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation model-based semantic transmission has recently shown great potential in wireless image communication. However, existing methods exhibit two major limitations: (i) they overlook the varying importance of semantic components for specific downstream tasks, and (ii) they insufficiently exploit wireless domain knowledge, resulting in limited robustness under dynamic channel conditions. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a foundation model-based adaptive semantic image transmission system for dynamic wireless environments, such as autonomous driving. The proposed system decomposes each image into a semantic segmentation map and a compressed representation, enabling task-aware prioritization of critical objects and fine-grained textures. A task-adaptive precoding mechanism then allocates radio resources according to the semantic importance of extracted features. To ensure accurate channel information for precoding, a channel estimation knowledge map (CEKM) is constructed using a conditional diffusion model that integrates user position, velocity, and sparse channel samples to train scenario-specific lightweight estimators. At the receiver, a conditional diffusion model reconstructs high-quality images from the received semantic features, ensuring robustness against channel impairments and partial data loss. Simulation results on the BDD100K dataset with multi-scenario channels generated by QuaDRiGa demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality (SSIM, LPIPS, FID), task-specific accuracy (IoU), and transmission efficiency. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating task-aware semantic decomposition, scenario-adaptive channel estimation, and diffusion-based reconstruction for robust semantic transmission in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of intraventricular bioimpedance in an in vivo pilot study with contextual pressure measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrocephalus is a neurological condition characterized by disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and is typically treated with shunt systems that drain excessive CSF out of the ventricular system. Continuous monitoring of ventricular CSF volume, however, remains a major unmet need in the clinical management of this condition. While intraventricular bioimpedance (BI) has been proposed as a potential marker of CSF volume, prior investigations have been limited to simulations, in vitro phantoms, and small animal models. This work presents the development of a measurement system for intraventricular BI and its evaluation in a large animal model. The measurement system was first validated in vitro using a mechatronic test bench replicating physiological CSF dynamics and subsequently applied in an in vivo pilot study with concurrent CSF and blood pressure monitoring. Time series analysis of the recorded signals revealed physiological BI waveform components linked to the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In addition, changes in BI following CSF volume alterations induced through intrathecal bolus infusions of artificial CSF were observed and found to be correlated to changes in CSF and blood pressures. These results provide the first in vivo evidence in a large animal model that BI reflects CSF dynamics as well as cerebral hemodynamics. Complementing intracranial pressure and CSF drainage measurements in smart shunt systems with BI could enable more comprehensive patient monitoring and physiologically informed control of hydrocephalus therapy.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication and Control for Energy-Efficient UAV Swarms: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking (MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Zero-Forcing Beamforming Strategies for the Uplink of an MU-MIMO System with Multi-Antenna Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the uplink of OFDMA-based MU-MIMO systems with multi-antenna users, for three Zero-Forcing (ZF) Beamforming (BF) strategies: Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-1 (CTR1), where only the strongest data stream is enabled per scheduled user; Block Diagonalization (BD), where all possible streams are enabled per scheduled user; Coordinated-Transmit-Receive-Flexible (CTRF), which allows a flexible stream allocation per user. The Radio Resource Management (RRM) of the uplink of all OFDMA-based systems must be done over an entire Time-Slot (TS) due to power management, making it challenging. To enable this study, we propose an efficient heuristic based on greedy-up searches for stream-sets that provides feasible solutions. It operates over the TS and considers fairness, practical Modulation and Coding Schemes and all RRM processes. The results show that, for Rural Macro scenarios, BD (resp. CTR1) could replace the more complex CTRF if the number of users is small (resp. large), while for Urban Macro scenarios, CTR1 emerges as an alternative to CTRF due to its similar performance. We also show that the system parameters can substantially impact the performance of the ZF strategies and that BD performance is more impaired with a simpler power management scheme than CTR1 and CTRF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D) communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of 6G wireless systems is taking place alongside the development of increasingly intelligent wireless devices and network nodes. The changing technological landscape is motivating a rethinking of classical Shannon information theory that emphasizes semantic and task-oriented paradigms. In this paper, we study a prediction-powered communication setting, in which devices, equipped with artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictors, communicate under zero-delay constraints with strict distortion guarantees. Two classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics, suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered compression methods.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Movable Antennas: Mechanical Power Modeling and Performance Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) offer additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance communication performance through local antenna movement. However, to achieve accurate and fast antenna movement, MA drivers entail non-negligible mechanical power consumption, rendering energy efficiency (EE) optimization more critical compared to conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. To address this issue, we develop a fundamental power consumption model for stepper motor-driven multi-MA systems based on electric motor theory. Based on this model, we formulate an EE maximization problem from a multi-MA base station (BS) to multiple single-FPA users. We aim to jointly optimize the MAs' positions, moving speeds, and the BS's transmit precoding matrix subject to collision-avoidance constraints during the multi-MA movements. However, this problem is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we first reveal that the collision-avoidance constraints can always be relaxed without loss of optimality by properly renumbering the MA indices. For the resulting relaxed problem, we first consider a simplified single-user setup and uncover a hidden monotonicity of the EE performance with respect to the MAs' moving speeds. To solve the remaining optimization problem, we develop a two-layer optimization framework. In the inner layer, the Dinkelbach algorithm is employed to derive the optimal beamforming solution for any given MA positions. In the outer layer, a sequential update algorithm is proposed to iteratively refine the MA positions based on the optimal values obtained from the inner layer. Next, we proceed to the general multi-user case and propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that despite the additional mechanical power consumption, the proposed algorithms can outperform both conventional FPA systems and other existing EE maximization benchmarks</description>

      <title>CURA: Size Isnt All You Need - A Compact Universal Architecture for On-Device Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains (e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches: (1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression, classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains. For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to 90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns, achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared error than competing models.</description>

Abstract: An experimental study on magnetic near-field (NF) scanning of printed circuit board (PCB) emission radiation is developed in this paper. The design and installation of the electromagnetic (EM) NF scanner is introduced. The test bed of magnetic NF emission in the microwave frequency range is described. The methodology of the microstrip magnetic NF probe is discussed. The probe calibration process was performed following the IEC 61967-1 NF scanning standard. The NF scanner functioning is tested with passive microstrip circuit square loop probe and device under test (DUT) PCB radiation in the test plan positioned at 1-mm above the ground plane. Based on the standard test with I-shape 50-$\Omega$ transmission line (TL), the calibration process of radiated magnetic field was validated by comparison between HFSS__ simulation and experimentation in very wideband frequency from 0.1-GHz to 3-GHz. Then, a nonstandard TL based DUT was experimented. Accordingly, the cartographies of scanned magnetic NF at two different test frequencies, 2 GHz and 3 GHz, are discussed. The NF scanner is under development for targeting the EMC radiated emission of PCB dedicated to operate in 6G wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Capacity Achieving Design for Hybrid Beamforming in Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid digital and analog beamforming is a highly effective technique for implementing beamforming methods in millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. It provides a viable solution to replace the complex fully digital beamforming techniques. However, the current design of precoding and combining matrices in hybrid beamforming solely relies on the channel information, neglecting the crucial consideration of the structure of covariance matrices of the transmit signals. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the joint design of hybrid beamforming matrices at the transmitter and receiver. This approach is centered around the optimization of the covariance matrix of the transmitted signals. Our goal is to maximize the downlink sum rate capacity of the system by achieving an optimal design of the transmit covariance matrix. We tackle the non-convex nature of this problem by leveraging the dual relationship between the broadcast channel (BC) and the multiple access channel (MAC). Through extensive simulations in various scenarios, including point-to-point multi-input multi-output (MIMO), multi-user (MU) multi-input single-output (MISO), and MU-MIMO, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over traditional designs. These results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of our approach in optimizing beamforming for mmWave systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Beam Depth Analysis for Large Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most wireless communication systems operate in the far-field region of antennas and antenna arrays, where waves are planar and beams have infinite depth. When antenna arrays become electrically large, it is possible that the receiver is in the radiative near-field of the transmitter, and vice versa. Recent works have shown that near-field beamforming exhibits a finite depth, which enables a new depth-based spatial multiplexing paradigm. In this paper, we explore how the shape and size of an array determine the near-field beam behaviors. In particular, we investigate the $3$ dB beam depth (BD), defined as the range of distances where the gain is greater than half of the peak gain. We derive analytical gain and BD expressions and prove how they depend on the aperture area and length. For non-broadside transmissions, we find that the BD increases as the transmitter approaches the end-fire direction of the array. Furthermore, it is sufficient to characterize the BD for a broadside transmitter, as the beam pattern with a non-broadside transmitter can be approximated by that of a smaller/projected array with a broadside transmitter. Our analysis demonstrates that the BD can be ordered from smallest to largest as ULA, circular, and square arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends various theoretical results from stationary data processing to cyclostationary (CS) processes under a unified framework. We first derive their asymptotic eigenbasis, which provides a link between their Fourier and Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansions, through a unitary transformation dictated by the cyclic spectrum. By exploiting this connection and the optimalities offered by the KL representation, we study the asymptotic performance of smoothing, filtering and prediction of CS processes, without the need for deriving explicit implementations. We obtain minimum mean squared error expressions that depend on the cyclic spectrum and include classical limits based on the power spectral density as particular cases. We conclude this work by applying the results to a practical scenario, in order to quantify the achievable gains of synchronous signal processing.</description>

      <title>Attentive Dilated Convolution for Automatic Sleep Staging using Force-directed Layout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep stages play an important role in identifying sleep patterns and diagnosing sleep disorders. In this study, we present an automated sleep stage classifier called the Attentive Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (AttDiCNN), which uses deep learning methodologies to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, computational complexity, and reliable and automatic sleep staging. We employed a force-directed layout based on the visibility graph to capture the most significant information from the EEG signals, thereby representing the spatial-temporal features. The proposed network consists of three modules: the Localized Spatial Feature Extraction Network (LSFE), Spatio-Temporal-Temporal Long Retention Network (S2TLR), and Global Averaging Attention Network (G2A). The LSFE captures spatial information from sleep data, the S2TLR is designed to extract the most pertinent information in long-term contexts, and the G2A reduces computational overhead by aggregating information from the LSFE and S2TLR. We evaluated the performance of our model on three comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.56%, 99.66%, and 99.08% for the EDFX, HMC, and NCH datasets, respectively, while maintaining a low computational complexity with 1.4 M parameters. Our proposed architecture surpasses existing methodologies in several performance metrics, thereby proving its potential as an automated tool for clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of HAPS-RIS on UAV-Based Networks: a Novel Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a network architecture where two types of aerial infrastructures together with a ground station provide connectivity to a remote area. A high altitude platform station (HAPS) is equipped with reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), so-called HAPS-RIS, to be exploited to assist the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based wireless networks. A key challenge in such networks is the restricted number of UAVs, which limits full coverage and leaves some users unsupported. To tackle this issue, we propose a hierarchical bilevel optimization framework including a leader and a follower problem. The users served by HAPS-RIS are in a zone called HAPS-RIS zone and the users served by the UAVs are in another zone called UAV zone. In the leader problem, the goal is to establish the zone boundary and practical RIS phase shift design that maximizes the number of users covered by HAPS-RIS while ensuring that users in this zone meet their rate requirements. This is achieved through our proposed relaxation method and algorithm based on the RIS clustering concept. The follower problem focuses on minimizing the number of UAVs required, ensuring that the rate requirements of the users in the UAV zone are met. This is addressed through our proposed dynamic method adopting k-means clustering technique with adaptive UAV selection. Our study reveals that increasing the number of RIS elements significantly decreases the number of required UAVs.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Beamforming Design for Physical Layer Multigroup Multicasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many wireless communication applications, it is desirable to transmit the same data to multiple user equipments (UEs). Physical layer multicasting presents an efficient transmission topology to exploit the beamforming capabilities at the transmitting nodes and broadcast nature of the wireless channel to satisfy the demand for the same content from several UEs. An advantage of multicasting is to avoid unnecessary co-channel interference between UEs requesting the same data. The difficulty is to find the suitable beamforming configuration that guarantees an acceptable minimum data rate, among the receiving UE group, to the multicast transmission. This paper addresses the max-min fair multigroup multicast optimization problem and proposes a novel iterative elimination procedure coupled with semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to find the near-optimal rank-1 beamforming vectors in a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) network. The proposed optimization procedure significantly improves computational complexity and spectral efficiency compared to common methods that use SDR followed by some randomization procedure and the state-of-the-art difference-of-convex approximation algorithm. The importance of the proposed procedure is that it is applicable to any SDR problem where a low-rank solution is desirable. Further, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that achieves 87 % of the optimal rank-1 solution at orders-of-magnitude lower computational time.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Semantic Communication via Multimodal Semantic Fusion with Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in traditional syntactic communications based on Shannon's theory, these methods struggle to meet the requirements of 6G immersive communications, especially under challenging transmission conditions. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), progress has been made in reconstructing videos using high-level semantic information. In this paper, we propose a scalable generative video semantic communication framework that extracts and transmits semantic information to achieve high-quality video reconstruction. Specifically, at the transmitter, description and other condition signals (e.g., first frame, sketches, etc.) are extracted from the source video, functioning as text and structural semantics, respectively. At the receiver, the diffusion-based GenAI large models are utilized to fuse the semantics of the multiple modalities for reconstructing the video. Simulation results demonstrate that, at an ultra-low channel bandwidth ratio (CBR), our scheme effectively captures semantic information to reconstruct videos aligned with human perception under different signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, the proposed ``First Frame+Desc." scheme consistently achieves CLIP score exceeding 0.92 at CBR = 0.0057 for SNR &gt; 0 dB. This demonstrates its robust performance even under low SNR conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting the number of complex exponentials and estimating their parameters from a noisy signal using the Matrix Pencil (MP) method. We introduce the MP modes and present their informative spectral structure. We show theoretically that these modes can be divided into signal and noise modes, where the signal modes exhibit a perturbed Vandermonde structure. Leveraging this structure, we propose a new MP algorithm, termed the SAMP algorithm, which has two novel components: (i) a robust, theoretically grounded model-order detection method, and (ii) an efficient estimation of the signal amplitudes. We show empirically that SAMP significantly outperforms the standard MP method in challenging conditions, with closely-spaced frequencies and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values, approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for a broad SNR range. Additionally, compared with prevalent information-based criteria, we show that SAMP achieves comparable or better results with lower computational time, and lower sensitivity to noise model mismatch.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Learning for Grant-Free Activity Detection in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grant-free random access (GF-RA) is a promising access technique for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in future wireless networks, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond (6G) systems. Within the context of GF-RA, this study investigates the efficiency of employing supervised machine learning techniques to tackle the challenges on the device activity detection (AD). GF-RA addresses scalability by employing non-orthogonal pilot sequences, which provides an efficient alternative comparing to conventional grant-based random access (GB-RA) technique that are constrained by the scarcity of orthogonal preamble resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight data-driven algorithmic framework specifically designed for activity detection in GF-RA for mMTC in cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. We propose two distinct framework deployment strategies, centralized and decentralized, both tailored to streamline the proposed approach implementation across network infrastructures. Moreover, we introduce optimized post-detection methodologies complemented by a clustering stage to enhance overall detection performances. Our 3GPP-compliant simulations have validated that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art model-based activity detection accuracy while significantly reducing complexity. Achieving 99% accuracy, it demonstrates real-world viability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Collection: UAV-Based RSS Measurements from the AFAR Challenge in Digital Twin and Real-World Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive real-world and Digital Twin (DT) dataset collected as part of the AERPAW Find A Rover (AFAR) Challenge, organized by the NSF Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless (AERPAW) testbed and hosted at the Lake Wheeler Field in Raleigh, North Carolina. The AFAR Challenge was a competition involving five finalist university teams, focused on promoting innovation in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF) source localization. Participating teams were tasked with designing UAV flight trajectories and localization algorithms to detect the position of a hidden unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), also referred to as a rover, emitting probe signals generated by GNU Radio. The competition was structured to evaluate solutions in a DT environment first, followed by deployment and testing in the AERPAW outdoor wireless testbed. For each team, the UGV was placed at three different positions, resulting in a total of 29 datasets, 15 collected in a DT simulation environment and 14 in a physical outdoor testbed. Each dataset contains time-synchronized measurements of received signal strength (RSS), received signal quality (RSQ), GPS coordinates, UAV velocity, and UAV orientation (roll, pitch, and yaw). Data is organized into structured folders by team, environment (DT and real-world), and UGV location. The dataset supports research in UAV-assisted RF source localization, air-to-ground (A2G) wireless propagation modeling, trajectory optimization, signal prediction, autonomous navigation, and DT validation. With 300k time-synchronized samples from the real-world experiments, the AFAR dataset enables effective training/testing of deep learning (DL) models and supports robust, real-world UAV-based wireless communication and sensing research.</description>

      <title>When Near Becomes Far: From Rayleigh to Optimal Near-Field and Far-Field Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition toward 6G is pushing wireless communication into a regime where the classical plane-wave assumption no longer holds. Millimeter-wave and sub-THz frequencies shrink wavelengths to millimeters, while meter-scale arrays featuring hundreds of antenna elements dramatically enlarge the aperture. Together, these trends collapse the classical Rayleigh far-field boundary from kilometers to mere single-digit meters. Consequently, most practical 6G indoor, vehicular, and industrial deployments will inherently operate within the radiating near-field, where reliance on the plane-wave approximation leads to severe array-gain losses, degraded localization accuracy, and excessive pilot overhead. This paper re-examines the fundamental question: \emph{``Where does the far-field truly begin?''} Rather than adopting purely geometric definitions, we introduce an application-oriented approach based on user-defined error budgets and a rigorous Fresnel-zone analysis that fully accounts for both amplitude and phase curvature. We propose three practical mismatch metrics: worst-case element mismatch, worst-case normalized mean square error, and spectral efficiency loss. For each metric, we derive a provably optimal transition distance--the minimal range beyond which mismatch permanently remains below a given tolerance--and provide closed-form solutions. Extensive numerical evaluations across diverse frequencies and antenna-array dimensions show that our proposed thresholds can exceed the Rayleigh distance by more than an order of magnitude. By transforming the near-field from a design nuisance into a precise, quantifiable tool, our results provide a clear roadmap for enabling reliable and resource-efficient near-field communications and sensing in emerging 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Contrastive Learning for ECG-Report Alignment with Waveform Enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, existing ECG-Report contrastive learning methods focus on whole-ECG and report alignment, missing the link between local ECG features and individual report tags. In this paper, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which achieves fine-grained alignment between specific ECG segments and each tag in the report via tag-specific ECG representations. Furthermore, we found that nearly 55\% of ECG reports in the MIMIC-ECG training dataset lack detailed waveform features, which hinders fine-grained alignment. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training process that leverages large language models (LLMs) to recover these missing waveform features and validate the LLM outputs using a coarse model. Additionally, fine-grained alignment at the tag level, rather than at the report level, exacerbates the false negative problem, as different reports may share common tags. To mitigate this, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide the model in identifying and correcting false negatives. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP significantly improves fine-grained alignment, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing. Meanwhile, the fine-grained reports we generate also enhance the performance of other methods.</description>

      <title>Wideband channel sensing with holographic interference surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Holographic Interference Surface (HIS) opens up a new prospect for building a more cost-effective wireless communication architecture by performing Radio Frequency (RF) domain signal processing. In this paper, we establish a wideband channel sensing architecture for electromagnetic wave reception and channel estimation based on the principle of holographic interference theory. Dute to the nonlinear structure of holograms, interferential fringes composed of wideband RF signals exhibit severe self-interference effects in the time-frequency domain, which are inherently resistant to the classical signal processing tools. To overcome the self-interference, we propose a holographic channel recovery method, which analyzes the time-domain variation of holograms from a geometrical perspective and constructs an inverse mapping from wideband holograms to object waves. Based on the Wirtinger partial derivative and Armijo condition, we then develop a wideband hologram-based maximum likelihood (WH-ML) estimation method for estimating the channel state information (CSI) from holograms. We also propose a geometric rotation-based object wave sensing (GROWS) algorithm to address the complicated computation of ML estimation. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for investigating the achievable performance of wideband holographic channel estimation. Simulation results show that under the wideband channel sensing architecture, our proposed algorithm can accurately estimate the CSI in wideband scenarios.</description>

      <title>Liquid Intelligent Metasurface for Fluid Antennas-Assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel liquid intelligent metasurface (LIM)-assisted downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, wherein both the base station (BS) and the metasurface are respectively equipped with fluid antennas (FA) and liquid elements. Unlike conventional reconfigurable metasurface-assisted systems with static geometries, the proposed architecture enables joint electromagnetic and spatial reconfigurability by allowing both the FA-empowered BS (FAS) and LIM to dynamically adjust their small-scale positions in addition to beamforming and phase-shift controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, LIM phase-shifts, and the positions of fluid antennas and liquid elements. The problem is highly non-convex due to coupling between variables, fractional expressions, unit-modulus constraints as well as spatial correlation functions. To address these challenges, we adopt alternating optimization and introduce auxiliary variables and employ Lagrangian dual and quadratic transformation, successive convex approximation (SCA) as well as the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) to solve the respective subproblems. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed FAS-LIM architecture significantly outperforms benchmark methods employing conventional fixed metasurface and fixed antenna arrays in terms of various parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Joint Multi-Target Detection-Tracking in Cognitive Massive MIMO Radar via POMCP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This correspondence presents a power-aware cognitive radar framework for joint detection and tracking of multiple targets in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar environment. Building on a previous single-target algorithm based on Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP), we extend it to the multi-target case by assigning each target an independent POMCP tree, enabling scalable and efficient planning.
  Departing from uniform power allocation, which is often suboptimal with varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), our approach predicts each target's future angular position and expected received power based on its expected range. These predictions guide adaptive waveform design via a constrained optimization problem that allocates transmit energy to enhance the detectability of weaker or distant targets, while ensuring sufficient power for high-SNR targets.
  Simulations involving multiple targets with different SNRs confirm the effectiveness of our method. The proposed framework for the cognitive radar improves detection probability for low-SNR targets and achieves more accurate tracking compared to approaches using uniform or orthogonal waveforms. These results demonstrate the potential of the POMCP-based framework for adaptive, efficient multi-target radar systems.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Doppler and Ionospheric Dispersion Correction Techniques for Arbitrary Waveforms Utilizing GPU Compute</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General requirements for radar digital signal processing are ionospheric distortion and Doppler dispersion correction, which has historically required radar-specific hardware to implement in real time. Although analog solutions are computationally efficient, they often come with system design drawbacks which limit waveform flexibility and can result in an overall increase of system complexity. With improvements in modern general compute systems, real-time digital signal processing is becoming more realizable using non-radar-specific high-performance compute. In this paper, we present an analysis of general Doppler and ionospheric correction algorithms for arbitrary waveforms for radar digital signal processing. We also include considerations for efficient implementation of these algorithms in software, specifically using GPU hardware. This analysis includes metrics of performance such as execution time and error correction accuracy. We also provide recommendations for application in radar signal processing. We identify two algorithms for dispersion correction: an FFT-based method for ionospheric dispersion and a numerical interpolation method via sinc interpolation for Doppler dispersion. Both of these algorithms are able to compensate for dispersion equivalent in accuracy to waveform-specific analytical methods and were able to be performed in real-time on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. These methods are waveform agnostic and applied directly to the samples, improving system flexibility and making them easy to incorporate into existing software-defined radio systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Radar based on Modulo Arithmetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS is modulation scheme where signals are formed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, converted to the time domain (DD) for transmission and reception, then returned to the DD domain for processing. We describe how to use the same architecture for radar sensing. The intended delay resolution is $\frac{1}{B}$ where $B$ is the radar bandwidth, and the intended Doppler resolution is $\frac{1}{T}$ where $T$ is the transmission time. We form a radar waveform in the DD domain, illuminate the scattering environment, match filter the return, then correlate with delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. This produces an image of the scattering environment, and the radar ambiguity function expresses the blurriness of this image. The possible delay and Doppler shifts generate the continuous Heisenberg-Weyl group which has been widely studied in the theory of radar. We describe how to approach the problem of waveform design, not from the perspective of this continuous group, but from the perspective of a discrete group of delay and Doppler shifts, where the discretization is determined by the intended delay and Doppler resolution of the radar. We describe how to approach the problem of shaping the ambiguity surface through symplectic transformations that normalize our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The complexity of traditional continuous radar signal processing is $\mathcal{O}\big(B^2T^2\big)$. We describe how to reduce this complexity to $\mathcal{O}\big(BT\log T\big)$ by choosing the radar waveform to be a common eigenvector of a maximal commutative subgroup of our discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group. The theory of symplectic transformations also enables defining libraries of optimal radar waveforms with small peak-to-average power ratios.</description>

      <title>Generalized Beyond-Diagonal RIS Architectures: Theory and Design via Structure-oriented Symmetric Unitary Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), which enables advanced wave control through interconnection of RIS elements, are gaining growing recognition as a promising technology for 6G and beyond. However, the enhanced flexibility of BD-RIS in controlling the phase and amplitude of reflected signals comes at the cost of high circuit complexity. In this paper, we propose two novel BD-RIS architectures, namely, the stem-connected RIS and cluster-connected RIS, to explore trade-off between circuit complexity and performance. Specifically, the proposed stem-connected RIS is capable of achieving the same performance as fully-connected RIS while significantly reducing circuit complexity. The proposed cluster-connected RIS offers a unified framework that generalizes existing BD-RIS architectures--including single-connected, fully-connected, group-connected, tree-connected (arrowhead), and forest-connected (arrowhead) RISs--as special cases. This framework enables a much more flexible trade-offs between circuit complexity and system performance than existing ones. Based on the proposed BD-RIS architectures, we introduce a novel and generalized structure-oriented symmetric unitary projection method for designing the scattering matrix across all BD-RIS configurations. This method is effectively applied to solve the sum channel gain maximization problem and other utility-based optimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed stem-connected RIS is the simplest architecture that achieves optimal BD-RIS performance, while the cluster-connected RIS further enlarges the performance-complexity trade-off range. Furthermore, the proposed projection-based algorithms demonstrate high efficiency.</description>

      <title>Impact of RHIs and ipSIC on Active RIS-NOMA Systems with Low-Precision ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system employing low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Analytical approximations for the outage probability (OP) are derived, considering residual hardware impairments (RHIs) and imperfect successive interference cancellation (ipSIC). Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic OP, system throughput, and diversity order at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed quantized ARIS-NOMA system outperforms its passive counterpart (PRIS-NOMA), achieving lower OP and higher throughput with reduced transmit power requirements and fewer reflecting elements. Moreover, the outage performance of both quantized ARIS-NOMA and PRIS-NOMA systems demonstrates significant improvement as the number of reflecting elements increases. The negative impacts of low-precision ADCs can be effectively mitigated by optimizing transmit power and scaling the number of reflecting elements.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Beyond-Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-RIS): Scattering Matrix Design via Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BD-RISs) are emerging as a transformative technology in wireless communications, enabling enhanced performance and quality of service (QoS) of wireless systems in harsh urban environments due to their relatively low cost and advanced signal processing capabilities. Generally, BD-RIS systems are employed to improve robustness, increase achievable rates, and enhance energy efficiency of wireless systems in both direct and indirect ways. The direct way is to produce a favorable propagation environment via the design of optimized scattering matrices, while the indirect way is to reap additional improvements via the design of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamformers that further exploit the latter "engineered" medium. In this article, the problem of sum-rate maximization via BD-RIS is examined, with a focus on feasibility, namely low-complexity physical implementation, by enforcing reciprocity in the BD-RIS design. We begin by outlining the system model and formulating an optimization problem that aims to enhance the system's sum-rate by designing a symmetric scattering matrix. In particular, the approach leverages a manifold optimization framework, where a penalty term is added to the objective function to ensure that the symmetry constraint is upheld, with reciprocity further enforced by projecting the obtained solution onto a set of feasible scattering matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in outperforming current state-of-the-art (SotA) approaches in terms of sum-rate maximization.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Performance Limit for Radar Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.04986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the thoughts and methodologies of Shannon's information theory to solve the problem of the optimal radar parameter estimation. Based on a general radar system model, the \textit{a posteriori} probability density function of targets' parameters is derived. Range information (RI) and entropy error (EE) are defined to evaluate the performance. It is proved that acquiring 1 bit of the range information is equivalent to reducing estimation deviation by half. The closed-form approximation for the EE is deduced in all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions, which demonstrates that the EE degenerates to the mean square error (MSE) when the SNR is tending to infinity. Parameter estimation theorem is then proved, which claims that the theoretical RI is achievable.
  The converse claims that there exists no unbiased estimator whose empirical RI is larger than the theoretical RI. Simulation result demonstrates that the theoretical EE is tighter than the commonly used Cram\'er-Rao bound and the ZivZakai bound.</description>

      <title>LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective approach for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, existing methods, whether based on handcrafted feature engineering or standard deep learning, face two major challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale EEG-AD datasets for robust representation learning, and 2) the absence of a dedicated deep learning pipeline for subject-level detection, which is more clinically meaningful than the commonly used sample-level detection. To address these gaps, we have curated the world's largest EEG-AD corpus to date, comprising 2,255 subjects. Leveraging this unique data corpus, we propose LEAD, the first large-scale foundation model for EEG analysis in dementia. Our approach provides an innovative framework for subject-level AD detection, including: 1) a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline such as artifact removal, resampling, and filtering, and a newly proposed multi-scale segmentation strategy, 2) a subject-regularized spatio-temporal transformer trained with a novel subject-level cross-entropy loss and an indices group-shuffling algorithm, and 3) AD-guided contrastive pre-training. We pre-train on 12 datasets (3 AD-related and 9 non-AD) and fine-tune/test on 4 AD datasets. Compared with 10 baselines, LEAD consistently obtains superior subject-level detection performance under the challenging subject-independent cross-validation protocol. On the benchmark ADFTD dataset, our model achieves an impressive subject-level Sensitivity of 90.91% under the leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) setting. These results strongly validate the effectiveness of our method for real-world EEG-based AD detection. Source code: https://github.com/DL4mHealth/LEAD</description>

      <title>Stability and performance guarantees for misspecified multivariate score-driven filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05021v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can stochastic gradient methods track a moving target? We address the problem of tracking multivariate time-varying parameters under noisy observations and potential model misspecification. Specifically, we examine implicit and explicit score-driven (ISD and ESD) filters, which update parameter predictions using the gradient of the logarithmic postulated observation density (commonly referred to as the score). For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path and the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the pseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment conditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are agnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the postulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is sufficient to guarantee stability. In contrast, the ESD filter additionally requires the score to be Lipschitz continuous and the learning rate to be sufficiently small. We validate our theoretical findings through simulation studies, showing that ISD filters outperform ESD filters in terms of accuracy and stability.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Weighted Projection for Reliable Low-Complexity Cooperative and Non-Cooperative Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage weighted projection method (TS-WPM) for time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA)-based localization, providing provable improvements in positioning accuracy, particularly under high geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. TS-WPM employs a two-stage iterative refinement approach that dynamically updates both range and position estimates, effectively mitigating residual errors while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, we extend TS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way time-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in scenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its error covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions for its optimality and robustness. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we develop a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-compliant analytical framework, incorporating 5G New Radio (NR) physical layer aspects as well as large-scale and small-scale fading. As part of this, we derive a generalized Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for multipath propagation and introduce a novel non-line-of-sight (NLOS) bias model that accounts for propagation conditions and SNR variations. Our evaluations demonstrate that TS-WPM achieves near-CRLB performance and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weighted nonlinear least squares (WNLS) in high GDOP and low SNR scenarios. Moreover, cooperative localization with TS-WPM significantly enhances accuracy, especially when an insufficient number of anchors (such as 2) are visible. Finally, we analyze the computational complexity of TS-WPM, showing its balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, making it a scalable solution for real-time localization in next-generation networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multiband passive sensing system that leverages IEEE 802.11bf Wi-Fi signals for environmental sensing, focusing on both sub-7 GHz and millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. By combining Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple bands, the system enhances accuracy and reliability in detecting human presence, movement, and activities in indoor environments. Utilizing a novel model, called MILAGRO, the system demonstrates robust performance across different scenarios, including monitoring human presence in workspaces and tracking movement in corridors. Experimental results show high accuracy (95-100%), with improved performance by integrating multiband data. The system also addresses key security concerns associated with passive sensing, proposing measures to mitigate potential risks. This work advances the use of Wi-Fi for passive sensing by reducing reliance on active sensing infrastructure and extending the capabilities of low-cost, non-intrusive environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Subspace Clustering of Subspaces: Unifying Canonical Correlation Analysis and Subspace Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for clustering a collection of tall matrices based on their column spaces, a problem we term Subspace Clustering of Subspaces (SCoS). Unlike traditional subspace clustering methods that assume vectorized data, our formulation directly models each data sample as a matrix and clusters them according to their underlying subspaces. We establish conceptual links to Subspace Clustering and Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA), and clarify key differences that arise in this more general setting. Our approach is based on a Block Term Decomposition (BTD) of a third-order tensor constructed from the input matrices, enabling joint estimation of cluster memberships and partially shared subspaces. We provide the first identifiability results for this formulation and propose scalable optimization algorithms tailored to large datasets. Experiments on real-world hyperspectral imaging datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior clustering accuracy and robustness, especially under high noise and interference, compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. These results highlight the potential of the proposed framework in challenging high-dimensional applications where structure exists beyond individual data vectors.</description>
