      <title>Understanding Teams and Productivity in Information Retrieval Research (2000-2018): Academia, Industry, and Cross-Community Collaborations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous researches on the Information retrieval (IR) field have focused on summarizing progress and synthesizing knowledge and techniques from individual studies and data-driven experiments, the extent of contributions and collaborations between researchers from different communities (e.g., academia and industry) in advancing IR knowledge remains unclear. To address this gap, this study explores several characteristics of information retrieval research in four areas: productivity patterns and preferred venues, the relationship between citations and downloads, changes in research topics, and changes in patterns of scientific collaboration, by analyzing 53,471 papers published between 2000 and 2018 from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library dataset. Through the analysis and interpretation on empirical datasets, we find that academic research, industry research, and collaborative research between academia and industry focused on different topics. Among the collaboration models, Academia-Industry Collaboration is more oriented towards large teamwork. Collaborative networks between researchers in academia and industry suggest that the field of information retrieval has become richer over time in terms of themes, foci, and sub-themes, becoming a more diverse field of study.</description>

      <title>[Re] Network Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work aims to reproduce the set of findings published in "Network Deconvolution" by Ye et al. (2020)[1]. That paper proposes an optimization technique for model training in convolutional neural networks. The proposed technique "network deconvolution" is used in convolutional neural networks to remove pixel-wise and channel-wise correlations before data is fed into each layer. In particular, we interrogate the validity of the authors' claim that using network deconvolution instead of batch normalization improves deep learning model performance. Our effort confirms the validity of this claim, successfully reproducing the results reported in Tables 1 and 2 of the original paper. Our study involved 367 unique experiments across multiple architectures, datasets, and hyper parameter configurations. For Table 1, while there were some minor deviations in accuracy when compared to the original values (within 10%), the overall trend was consistent with the original study's findings when training the models with epochs 20 and 100. For Table 2, all 14 reproduced values were consistent with the original values. Additionally, we document the training and testing times for each architecture in Table 1 with 1, 20, and 100 epoch settings for both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. We document the total execution times for Table 2 architectures with the ImageNet dataset. The data and software used for this reproducibility study are publicly available at https://github.com/lamps-lab/rep-network-deconvolution.</description>

      <title>Integrating Visual and Textual Inputs for Searching Large-Scale Map Collections with CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the prevalence and historical importance of maps in digital collections, current methods of navigating and exploring map collections are largely restricted to catalog records and structured metadata. In this paper, we explore the potential for interactively searching large-scale map collections using natural language inputs ("maps with sea monsters"), visual inputs (i.e., reverse image search), and multimodal inputs (an example map + "more grayscale"). As a case study, we adopt 562,842 images of maps publicly accessible via the Library of Congress's API. To accomplish this, we use the mulitmodal Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) machine learning model to generate embeddings for these maps, and we develop code to implement exploratory search capabilities with these input strategies. We present results for example searches created in consultation with staff in the Library of Congress's Geography and Map Division and describe the strengths, weaknesses, and possibilities for these search queries. Moreover, we introduce a fine-tuning dataset of 10,504 map-caption pairs, along with an architecture for fine-tuning a CLIP model on this dataset. To facilitate re-use, we provide all of our code in documented, interactive Jupyter notebooks and place all code into the public domain. Lastly, we discuss the opportunities and challenges for applying these approaches across both digitized and born-digital collections held by galleries, libraries, archives, and museums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The report explores the challenges and strategies for preserving 3D digital data in cultural heritage. It discusses the issue of technological obsolescence, emphasising the need for ustainable storage solutions and ongoing data management strategies. Key topics include understanding technological obsolescence, the lifecycle of digital content, digital continuity, data management plans (DMP), FAIR principles, and the use of public repositories. The report also covers the importance of metadata in long-term digital preservation, including types of metadata and strategies for building valuable metadata. It examines the evolving standards and interoperability in 3D format preservation and the importance of managing metadata and paradata. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions for preserving 3D cultural heritage data in the long term.</description>
