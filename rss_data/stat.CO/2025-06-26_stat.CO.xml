      <title>AutoWMM and JAGStree -- R packages for Population Size Estimation on Relational Tree-Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weighted multiplier method (WMM) is an extension of the traditional method of back-calculation method to estimate the size of a target population, which synthesizes available evidence from multiple subgroups of the target population with known counts and estimated proportions by leveraging the tree-structure inherent to the data. Hierarchical Bayesian models offer an alternative to modeling population size estimation on such a structure, but require non-trivial theoretical and practical knowledge to implement. While the theory underlying the WMM methodology may be more accessible to researchers in diverse fields, a barrier still exists in execution of this method, which requires significant computation. We develop two \texttt{R} packages to help facilitate population size estimation on trees using both the WMM and hierarchical Bayesian modeling; \textit{AutoWMM} simplifies WMM estimation for any general tree topology, and \textit{JAGStree} automates the creation of suitable JAGS MCMC modeling code for these same networks.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Geopolitical Events with a Sparse Temporal Fusion Transformer and Gaussian Process Hybrid: A Case Study in Middle Eastern and U.S. Conflict Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting geopolitical conflict from data sources like the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT) is a critical challenge for national security. The inherent sparsity, burstiness, and overdispersion of such data cause standard deep learning models, including the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), to produce unreliable long-horizon predictions. We introduce STFT-VNNGP, a hybrid architecture that won the 2023 Algorithms for Threat Detection (ATD) competition by overcoming these limitations. Designed to bridge this gap, our model employs a two-stage process: first, a TFT captures complex temporal dynamics to generate multi-quantile forecasts. These quantiles then serve as informed inputs for a Variational Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Process (VNNGP), which performs principled spatiotemporal smoothing and uncertainty quantification. In a case study forecasting conflict dynamics in the Middle East and the U.S., STFT-VNNGP consistently outperforms a standalone TFT, showing a superior ability to predict the timing and magnitude of bursty event periods, particularly at long-range horizons. This work offers a robust framework for generating more reliable and actionable intelligence from challenging event data, with all code and workflows made publicly available to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Bayesian analysis for the Galton-Watson process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galton-Watson process is a model for population growth which assumes that individuals reproduce independently according to the same offspring distribution. Inference usually focuses on the offspring average as it allows to classify the process with respect to extinction. We propose a fully non-parametric approach for Bayesian inference on the GW model using a Dirichlet Process prior. The prior naturally generalizes the Dirichlet conjugate prior distribution, and it allows learning the support of the offspring distribution from the data as well as taking into account possible overdispersion of the data. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with both frequentist and Bayesian procedures via simulation. In particular, we show that the use of a DP prior yields good classification performance with both complete and incomplete data. A real-world data example concerning COVID-19 data from Sardinia illustrates the use of the approach in practice.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm with Innovative Chromosome Patterns in the Breeding Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes Genetic Algorithm with Border Trades (GAB), a novel modification of the standard genetic algorithm that enhances exploration by incorporating new chromosome patterns in the breeding process. This approach significantly mitigates premature convergence and improves search diversity. Empirically, GAB achieves up to 8x higher fitness and 10x faster convergence on complex job scheduling problems compared to standard Genetic Algorithms, reaching average fitness scores of 888 versus 106 in under 20 seconds. On the classic Flip-Flop problem, GAB consistently finds optimal or near-optimal solutions in fewer generations, even as input sizes scale to thousands of bits. These results highlight GAB as a highly effective and computationally efficient alternative for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>
