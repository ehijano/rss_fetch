      <title>Pore network models for the evaporation of complex fluids in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drying of fluids undergoing sol-gel transition in porous media, a process crucial for the consolidation of damaged porous structures in cultural heritage, often leads to skin formation at the surface. This phenomenon significantly hinders evaporation, yet its precise impact on drying kinetics remains poorly understood. To uncover the governing mechanisms, we develop a novel pore network model that closely replicates quasi-2D experimental porous media, incorporating spatial gradients in pore size distribution, with smaller pores near the evaporation side. We demonstrate that this pore distribution dictates the air invasion path and extends the constant-rate period of drying in Newtonian liquids, reproducing the experimental drying curves for water. We further extend our model to capture the interplay of capillary-driven liquid flows, space-dependent viscosity increases, and localized skin formation. To incorporate skin formation, we implement a viscosity-dependent evaporation pressure rule derived from experimental data on evaporation-induced sol-gel transition within a capillary tube. We identify a simple relationship: vapor pressure decreases once the meniscus fluid viscosity exceeds a critical threshold. By accounting for localized skin formation through reduced evaporation pressure at high-viscosity throats, our model successfully captures the slowdown of drying kinetics, achieving remarkable agreement with experimental drying curve.</description>

      <title>Can one hear the shape of a crystal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isospectrality is a general fundamental concept often involving whether various operators can have identical spectra, i.e., the same set of eigenvalues. In the context of the Laplacian operator, the famous question ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' concerns whether different shaped drums can have the same vibrational modes. The isospectrality of a lattice in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a tantamount to whether it is uniquely determined by its theta series, i.e., the radial distribution function $g_2(r)$. While much is known about the isospectrality of Bravais lattices across dimensions, little is known about this question of more general crystal (periodic) structures with an $n$-particle basis ($n \ge 2$). Here, we ask, What is $n_{\text{min}}(d)$, the minimum value of $n$ for inequivalent (i.e., unrelated by isometric symmetries) crystals with the same theta function in space dimension $d$? To answer these questions, we use rigorous methods as well as a precise numerical algorithm that enables us to determine the minimum multi-particle basis of inequivalent isospectral crystals. Our algorithm identifies isospectral 4-, 3- and 2-particle bases in one, two and three spatial dimensions, respectively. For many of these isospectral crystals, we rigorously show that they indeed possess identical $g_2(r)$ up to infinite $r$. Based on our analyses, we conjecture that $n_{\text{min}}(d) = 4, 3, 2$ for $d = 1, 2, 3$, respectively. The identification of isospectral crystals enables one to study the degeneracy of the ground-state under the action of isotropic pair potentials.</description>

      <title>A chain stretch-based gradient-enhanced model for damage and fracture in elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel stretch-based gradient-enhanced damage (GED) model that allows the fracture to localize and also captures the development of a physically diffuse damage zone. This capability contrasts with the paradigm of the phase field method for fracture, where a sharp crack is numerically approximated in a diffuse manner. Capturing fracture localization and diffuse damage in our approach is achieved by considering nonlocal effects that encompass network topology, heterogeneity, and imperfections. These considerations motivate the use of a statistical damage function dependent upon the nonlocal deformation state. From this model, fracture toughness is realized as an output. While GED models have been classically utilized for damage modeling of structural engineering materials, they face challenges when trying to capture the cascade from damage to fracture, often leading to damage zone broadening. This deficiency contributed to the popularity of the phase-field method over the GED model for elastomers and other quasi-brittle materials. Other groups have proceeded with damage-based GED formulations that prove identical to the phase-field method (Lorentz et al., 2012), but these inherit the aforementioned limitations. To address this issue in a thermodynamically consistent framework, we implement two modeling features (a nonlocal driving force bound and a simple relaxation function) specifically designed to capture the evolution of a physically meaningful damage field and the simultaneous localization of fracture, thereby overcoming a longstanding obstacle in the development of these nonlocal strain- or stretch-based approaches. We discuss several numerical examples to understand the features of the approach at the limit of incompressibility, and compare them to the phase-field method as a benchmark for the macroscopic response and fracture energy predictions.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Liquid Water Diffusivity at Temperatures near the Glass Transition Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopically layered amorphous solid water films were used to measure the diffusivity of deeply supercooled liquid water near the glass transition. The films, composed of separate layers of oxygen 16 and oxygen 18 labeled water, were grown by vapor deposition at low temperature and then heated to observe the intermixing of the isotopic layers. Very slow heating rates (as low as 0.0001 K/s) were used to decouple the diffusion and crystallization processes to ensure that the observed intermixing occurred at temperatures that were well-separated from the onset of crystallization. Numerical simulations of the desorption spectra were used to extract the translational diffusivities. The diffusivities obtained in this paper are consistent with translational liquid-like motion at temperatures near and above the proposed Tg of 136 K. These findings support the idea that the melt of amorphous water, above its glass transition temperature is thermodynamically continuous with normal supercooled liquid.</description>

      <title>Quantitative thermodynamic analyses of nucleation, evolution and stabilization of surface nanobubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface nanobubbles are complex micro- and nanoscale fluid systems. While thermodynamics is believed to dominate nanobubble dynamics, the precise mechanism by which nanobubble evolution is driven by thermodynamics remains unclear. It is essential to understand how nanobubble nucleation and growth, nanoscale contact line movement, and gas diffusion across the liquid-bubble interface are simultaneously driven by the change in free energy, leading to the ultimate thermodynamic equilibrium of surface nanobubble systems. In this paper, we first propose a quantitative theoretical model to elucidate the thermodynamic dominance behind the dynamics and stability of the fluid system with surface nanobubbles. The present model demonstrates that thermodynamic non-equilibrium drives the gas diffusion and the contact line motion of surface nanobubbles. Overcoming the nucleation energy barrier is crucial for bubble nucleation and growth. Surface nanobubbles evolve towards the reduction of the system's free energy and stabilize at the state with minimum free energy. The thermodynamic equilibrium is accompanied by the mechanical equilibrium at the contact line and the gas diffusion equilibrium at the liquid-bubble interface, and the theoretical results are in excellent agreement with the nanobubble morphology observed in experiments. The study highlights the significant influence of gas properties and ambient conditions in promoting bubble nucleation and stability.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left- or right-handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer-twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, we develop two types of achiral molecules (BOE-NO2 and DIOLT) that possess different molecular structure but exhibit a NF-ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. We demonstrate that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE-NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using a theoretical approach based on the equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)], which was recently justified based on extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the hard-sphere phase diagram [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the underlying equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions of $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio of the standard deviation of the disk diameter distribution to its mean $s$. For the power-law size distribution evaluated at $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. Instead, one could require the continuity of all components of the viscous stress tensor on the interface without exception. In this paper, it is shown that this approach gives a droplet velocity that coincides with the Stokes drag force formula for a sphere of a given radius.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Bouncing Barrier with Collision Simulations of Compressed Dust Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collision outcomes of dust aggregates in protoplanetary disks dictate how planetesimals form. Experimental and numerical studies have suggested that bouncing collisions occurring at low impact velocities may limit aggregate growth in the disks, but the conditions under which bouncing occurs have yet to be fully understood. In this study, we perform a suite of collision simulations of moderately compact dust aggregates with various impact velocities, aggregate radii, and filling factors ranging between 0.4 and 0.5. Unlike previous simulations, we generate compact aggregates by compressing more porous ones, mimicking the natural processes through which compact aggregates form. We find that the compressed aggregates bounce above a threshold mass, which decreases with impact velocity. The threshold mass scales with impact velocity as the $-4/3$ power, consistent with the findings of previous experiments. We also find that the threshold aggregate mass for bouncing depends strongly on filling factor, likely reflecting the strong filling-factor dependence of the compressive strength of compressed aggregates. Our energy analysis reveals that nearly 90\% of the initial impact energy is dissipated during the initial compression phase, and over 70\% of the remaining energy is dissipated during the subsequent stretching phase, regardless of whether the collision results in sticking or bouncing. Our results indicate that dust aggregates with a filling factor of 0.4 cease to grow beyond 100 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ as a result of the bouncing barrier.</description>

      <title>Time scale competition in the Active Coagulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spreading processes on top of active dynamics provide a novel theoretical framework for capturing emerging collective behavior in living systems. I consider run-and-tumble dynamics coupled with coagulation/decoagulation reactions that lead to an absorbing state phase transition. While the active dynamics does not change the location of the transition point, the relaxation toward the stationary state depends on motility parameters. Because of the competition between spreading dynamics and active motion, the system can support long-living currents whose typical time scale is a nontrivial function of motility and reaction rates. Beyond the mean-field regime, instability at finite length scales regulates a crossover from periodic to diffusive modes. Finally, it is possible to individuate different mechanisms of pattern formation on a large time scale, ranging from Fisher-Kolmogorov to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity; this is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics (defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy) is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Droplet impact on elastic substrates: force scaling crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplet impacts are fundamental to fluid-structure interactions, shaping processes from erosion to bioprinting. While previous scaling laws have provided insights into droplet dynamics, force scaling laws remain insufficiently understood, particularly for soft substrates where both the droplet and substrate deform significantly. Here, we show that droplet impacts on elastic substrates exhibit a scaling crossover in maximum impact force, transitioning from inertial force scaling, typical for rigid substrates under high inertia, to Hertzian impact scaling, characteristic of rigid spheres on elastic substrates. Using high-speed photoelastic tomography, we captured high-resolution dynamic stress fields and identified a similarity parameter governing the interplay between droplet inertia, substrate elasticity, and deformation time scales. Our findings redefine how substrate properties influence impact forces, demonstrating that droplets under high inertia -- long thought to follow inertial force scaling -- can instead follow Hertzian impact scaling on soft substrates. This framework provides practical insights for designing soft, impact-resistant materials.</description>

      <title>Field theories of active particle systems and their entropy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particles that translate chemical energy into self-propulsion can maintain a far-from-equilibrium steady state and perform work. The entropy production measures how far from equilibrium such a particle system operates and serves as a proxy for the work performed. Field theory offers a promising route to calculating entropy production, as it allows for many interacting particles to be considered simultaneously. Approximate field theories obtained by coarse-graining or smoothing that draw on additive noise can capture densities and correlations well, but they generally ignore the microscopic particle nature of the constituents, thereby producing spurious results for the entropy production. As an alternative we demonstrate how to use Doi-Peliti field theories, which capture the microscopic dynamics, including reactions and interactions with external and pair potentials. Such field theories are in principle exact, while offering a systematic approximation scheme, in the form of diagrammatics. We demonstrate how to construct them from a Fokker-Planck equation and show how to calculate entropy production of active matter from first principles. This framework is easily extended to include interaction. We use it to derive exact, compact and efficient general expressions for the entropy production for a vast range of interacting conserved particle systems. These expressions are independent of the underlying field theory and can be interpreted as the spatial average of the local entropy production. They are readily applicable to numerical and experimental data. In general, the entropy production due to any pair interaction draws at most on the three point, equal time density; and an $n$-point interaction on the $(2n-1)$-point density. We illustrate the technique in a number of exact, tractable examples, including some with pair-interaction as well as in a system of many interacting ABPs.</description>

Abstract: Breakdown of time-reversal symmetry is a defining property of non-equilibrium systems, such as active matter, which is composed of units that consume energy. We employ a formalism that allows us to derive a class of identities associated with the time-reversal transformation in non-equilibrium field theories, in the spirit of Ward-Takahashi identities. We present a generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem valid for active systems as a particular realization of such an identity, and consider its implications and applications for a range of active field theories. The field theoretical toolbox developed here helps to quantify the degree of non-equilibrium activity of complex systems exhibiting collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>

Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>
