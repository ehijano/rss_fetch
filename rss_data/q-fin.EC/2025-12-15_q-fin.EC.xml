      <title>Classifying Tokenised Money: Dimensions and Design Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenised money encompasses a broad range of digital monetary instruments issued on distributed ledger technology, including Central Bank Digital Currencys (CBDCs), deposit tokens, stablecoins, and decentralised protocol-based designs. Despite their shared monetary function, these instruments differ markedly in issuer structure, collateralisation, stability mechanisms, governance, and technological embedding, creating conceptual ambiguity. This paper proposes a concise taxonomy spanning twelve key design dimensions, offering a systematic framework for comparing heterogeneous forms of tokenised money. The taxonomy clarifies how different design choices shape monetary properties, risks, and policy implications, supporting clearer analysis and dialogue across academia, industry, and regulation.</description>

      <title>A Quarter of US-Trained Scientists Eventually Leave. Is the US Giving Away Its Edge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using newly-assembled data from 1980 through 2024, we show that 25% of scientifically-active, US-trained STEM PhD graduates leave the US within 15 years of graduating. Leave rates are lower in the life sciences and higher in AI and quantum science but overall have been stable for decades. Contrary to common perceptions, US technology benefits from these graduates' work even if they leave: though the US share of global patent citations to graduates' science drops from 70% to 50% after migrating, it remains five times larger than the destination country share, and as large as all other countries combined. These results highlight the value that the US derives from training foreign scientists - not only when they stay, but even when they leave.</description>

      <title>Tariffs and Labor Markets: The Employment Impact of the Recent Trade Conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper assesses the global employment and trade effects of renewed tariff escalation following the reintroduction of the United States' America First strategy in 2025. Using a multiregional input-output (MRIO) framework integrated with a trade model, the analysis captures endogenous adjustments in bilateral trade shares and final demand in response to changes in prices and competitiveness. Three scenarios are simulated to reflect alternative configurations of trade policy: existing tariffs without retaliation, updated tariffs including retaliatory measures, and a potential scenario characterized by de-escalation of the trade conflict. The results indicate that tariff increases generate widespread employment and export losses, with cumulative global job declines exceeding 23 million in the most adverse scenario. Informal and low-skilled workers bear the largest burden, accounting for more than 80 percent of total employment losses, while high-income and upper middle-income countries experience significant contractions in export volumes.</description>

      <title>Sacred Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can religions shape ecosystems? We explore the role religious beliefs play in human-environment interactions by studying African Traditional Religions (ATR), which place forests within a sacred sphere. We focus on the unique case of Benin, whose history is deeply intertwined with traditional religions and where adherence is reliably reported. By exploiting three sources of exogenous variation in Benin's exposure to Charismatic Pentecostalism, we find that increase in ATR adherence yields positive changes in both forest and tree canopy cover. This increase is driven by sustainable land use policies rather than cooperation and shared governance mechanisms. To understand how ATR beliefs shape the way individuals combine the sacred and the ecology in their preferences, we build a theoretical framework of deforestation with heterogeneous pro-environmental attitudes driven by ATR adherence. Bringing the model to the data, we estimate that without any ATR adherence Benin would experience a loss of 10% of its tree canopy area, and would exhibit unsustainable deforestation rates. Our results show how ATR beliefs can play a fundamental role in forest and ecosystem conservation.</description>

      <title>Delays and Deferrals in Nuclear Waste Disposal: A Stochastic Analysis of Funding Shortfalls of Germany's Waste Fund KENFO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Germany is tasked with ensuring the safe and final storage of high-level radioactive waste in a deep geological repository. Since 2022, the ambitious target year of 2031 to identify a suitable location for such a site has been deferred by most public actors. The target year was pushed back by several decades to 2046 or even 2068, consequently delaying the completion of all waste management activities well into the 22nd century. Most radioactive waste management activities in Germany are funded via the external fund KENFO that was initiated with an initial endowment of EUR24.1 bn. in 2017. KENFO hopes to achieve average returns on invest (ROI) of 3.7% over the coming decades to ensure that sufficient funds remain. However, the delays in the current process will likely result in overall cost increases. Thus, in this analysis, we conduct a stochastic analysis of the potential delays in the site selection procedure and their corresponding cost effects to assess whether KENFO's target ROI will suffice for the long-term funding requirements. We find that even under optimistic assumptions, KENFO's ROI would have to be increased to at least 5.91%, up to 6.63%. Alternatively, lump sum injections of up to EUR31.07 bn. as of 2024 could reduce funding shortfall risks. We conclude that in order to minimize the financial burden on future generations, German policymakers must address this issue of potential funding shortfalls proactively, either by reducing costs, via, e.g., delay minimization, or by increasing revenues, via, e.g., capital injections.</description>

      <title>AI and Jobs: Has the Inflection Point Arrived? Evidence from an Online Labor Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) influences various online labor markets (OLMs) over time. Employing the Difference-in-Differences method, we discovered two distinct scenarios following ChatGPT's launch: displacement effects featuring reduced work volume and earnings, exemplified by translation &amp; localization OLM; productivity effects featuring increased work volume and earnings, exemplified by web development OLM. To understand these opposite effects in a unified framework, we developed a Cournot competition model to identify an inflection point for each market. Before this point, human workers benefit from AI enhancements; beyond this point, human workers would be replaced. Further analyzing the progression from ChatGPT 3.5 to 4.0, we found three effect scenarios, reinforcing our inflection point conjecture. Heterogeneous analyses reveal that U.S. web developers tend to benefit more from ChatGPT's launch compared to their counterparts in other regions. Experienced translators seem more likely to exit the market than less experienced translators.</description>
