      <title>V455 Car: an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type binary in triple star system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V455 Car is a southern oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system with an orbital period of 5.132888 days. Our first photometric solutions based on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite indicate that it is a semi-detached binary with the secondary star is almost filling its Roche lobe. The noticeable O'Connell effect in light curve could be explained by hot spot on the primary component, which may be attributed to the mass transfer from the secondary component to the primary one. The absolute parameters are determined as: $M_{1} = 5.30 \pm 1.10 \, \rm M_{\odot}$, $R_{1} = 3.17 \pm 0.22 \, \rm R_{\odot}$ for the primary, and $M_{2} = 1.58 \pm 0.32 \, \rm M_{\odot}$, $R_{2} = 6.66 \pm 0.46 \, \rm R_{\odot}$ for the secondary. \textbf{Based on $O-C$ analysis, we find a periodic variation of $P_3=26.62(\pm1.66)\,yr$. The periodic oscillation suggests a possible third body with a minimal mass of $0.59(\pm0.13)\,\rm M_{\odot}$}. It is speculated that the secondary star has undergone a longer evolution, leading to a mass ratio reversal being experienced in the binary system. Our frequency analysis finds that the primary of V455 Car may be an SPB/SLF star. This study reports a novel example of an oscillating eclipsing Algol-type system featuring an SPB/SLF primary star and a red giant star, which suggest that strong observational results for a high incidence of third bodies in massive binaries.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the mystery of Sr synthesis in the early Galaxy through analysis of barium isotopes in very metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the contributions of the rapid (r) and slow (s) neutron capture processes to the Ba isotope mixture, along with Ba, Eu, and Sr NLTE abundances, in a sample of very metal-poor stars. The selected stars formed before the contribution from the main s-process in low- and intermediate-mass stars became significant. Some of our sample stars are enhanced in Sr, with [Sr/Ba] reaching up to 0.7. These stars gained their high Sr abundance from a poorly understood process, which may appear to be a weak s-process or a weak r-process. Our aim is to uncover the nature of this additional Sr source. The abundances derived from the resonance Ba II lines are influenced by the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We compute Ba isotope mixtures corresponding to different r- to s-process contributions and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba II resonance lines in each sample star. Additionally, we determine Ba abundances from weak subordinate Ba II lines, which are unaffected by the adopted Ba isotope mixture. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the subordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher s-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba] overabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the early s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio produced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2. Regarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive stars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this process within the error bars in our sample stars. In the early Galaxy, before significant main s-process enrichment, barium and strontium were produced primarily by the main r-process and the early s-process, which occurred in rapidly rotating massive stars.</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Thermal Processes in Stellar Flares on AU Mic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of non-thermal proton energy transportation during solar and stellar flares is largely unknown; a better understanding of this physical process will allow us to rectify longstanding deficiencies in flare models. One way to detect the presence of non-thermal protons during flares is through the Orrall-Zirker (OZ) effect whereby an enhanced red wing appears in hydrogen emission lines (e.g., Lyman-$\alpha$ at 1215.67 Angstrom). We analyze archival Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph G130M (1060 - 1360 Angstrom) observations of the young M dwarf, AU Mic to search for evidence of OZ effect during the impulsive phase of six stellar flares with $E_\textrm{flare} \approx 10^{30 - 31}$ erg. While we found non-detections of the OZ effect, we note there is a pronounced blue enhancement in several C II and C III emission lines during one of the high-energy flares. We propose that either filament eruptions or chromospheric evaporation could be the mechanism driving this observed blue enhancement. We compare the far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra to 1D radiative-hydrodynamic stellar flare models, which are unable to reproduce the blue enhancement and broadening in these cool flare lines. By completing a line-by-line analysis of the FUV spectrum of AU Mic, we provide further constraints on the physical mechanisms producing stellar flares on M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS) V: properties of volume-limited samples of Galactic evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a meta-study of the statistical and individual properties of two volume-complete sets of evolved stars in the Solar Neighbourhood: (1) 852 stars from the Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS), and (2) a partially overlapping set of 507 evolved stars within 300 pc. We also investigate distance determinations to these stars, their luminosity functions and their spatial distribution. Gaia APSIS GSP-Phot AENEAS temperatures of bright giant stars often appear to be underestimated. Existing literature on AGB stars under-samples both the most and least extreme nearby dust-producing stars. We reproduce the literature star-formation history of the solar neighbourhood, though stellar-evolution models over-predict the number of AGB stars of ages around 500 Myr. The distribution of AGB stars broadly matches the known 300 pc scale height of the Galactic disc and shows concentration in the direction of the Galactic centre. Most dust-producing carbon stars belong to the Galactic thick-disc population.</description>

      <title>Core-Corona Decomposition of Very Compact (Neutron) Stars: Accounting for Current Data of XTE J1814-338</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core-corona decomposition of compact (neutron) star models was compared with the current mass-radius data of the outlier XTE~J1814-338. The corona (which may also be dubbed the envelope, halo or outer crust) is assumed to be of Standard Model matter, with an equation of state that is supposed to be faithfully known and accommodates nearly all other neutron star data. The core, solely parameterized by its mass, radius and transition pressure, presents a challenge regarding its composition. We derived a range of core parameters needed to describe the current data of XTE J1814-338.</description>

      <title>No influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and random stellar parameters (&gt;400 simulations), we find no influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Stellar Ancestry Unlocked: Chemical and Orbital Clues Link Metal Poor Stars to Globular Clusters and the Galaxy's Thick Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed chemical, kinematic, and orbital dynamic analysis of five metal poor stars in the solar neighborhood: HD 2665, HD 5916, HD 122956, HD 189349, and HD 218857. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data from the ELODIE and ESPaDOnS instruments, we derived elemental abundances for 29 species (25 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Sm) via LTE based analysis with ATLAS9 model atmospheres. Notably, we report first time detections of Ce and Nd in HD2665; Al, V, Sm, and Mn in HD5916; Al in HD 122956; and C, O, S, Sc, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Zr, Nd, and Sm in HD 189349. Dynamical and chemical diagnostics reveal distinct origins: HD 2665 shows strong orbital and chemical similarity to GC NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), while HD 218857 exhibits chemodynamic signatures consistent with NGC 5634. HD 122956 aligns with NGC 6864 (M75), though intriguingly shares age, metallicity ([Fe/H]), and [Mg/Fe] ratios with NGC 6517, a cluster whose reported abundances are derived solely from one star with APOGEE $H$-band spectroscopic measurements, as no optical spectroscopic data exist for its members. In contrast, HD 5916 and HD 189349 exhibit kinematic and chemical properties consistent with the field-star population and are classified as thick disk members.</description>

      <title>Open clusters in the outer disc studied with MEGARA@GTC Auner 1 and Berkeley 102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We obtained medium-resolution spectra (R &gt; 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +- 0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7 kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +- 0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +- 0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channelling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the interplay between vortex dynamics and Lorentz forces. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): I. Program Overview and Summary of First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr). Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio, which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($&lt;$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks, and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models overestimate gas masses of $&gt;$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): II. Dust and Gas Disk Properties in the Ophiuchus Star-forming Region</title>

Abstract: The ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program aims to trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. This paper presents Band-6 ALMA observations of 10 embedded (Class I and Flat Spectrum) sources in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, with spectral types ranging from M3 to K6 stars, which serve as the evolutionary starting point in the AGE-PRO sample. While we find 4 nearly edge on disks (&gt;70 deg.), and 3 highly inclined disks (&gt;60 deg.) in our sample, we show that, as a population, embedded disks in Ophiuchus are not significantly contaminated by more evolved, but highly inclined sources. We derived dust disk masses from the Band 6 continuum and estimated gas disk masses from the C18O and C17O lines. The mass estimates from the C17O line are slightly higher, suggesting C18O emission might be partially optically thick. While the 12CO and 13CO lines are severely contaminated by extended emission and self-absorption, the C18O and C17O lines allowed us to trace the radial extent of the gaseous disks. From these measurements, we found that the C18O and C17O fluxes correlate well with each other and with the continuum fluxes. Furthermore, the C18O and C17O lines present a larger radial extension than disk dust sizes by factors ranging from 1.5 to 2.5, as it is found for Class II disks using the radial extension of the 12CO. In addition, we have detected outflows in three disks from 12CO observations.</description>

Abstract: We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6 stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO) Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6 setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of $\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between $10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program AGE-PRO explores protoplanetary disk evolution by studying gas and dust across various ages. This work focuses on ten evolved disks in Upper Scorpius, observed in dust continuum emission, CO and its isotopologues, and N$_2$H$^+$ with ALMA Bands 6 and 7. Disk radii, from the radial location enclosing 68% of the flux, are comparable to those in the younger Lupus region for both gas and dust tracers. However, solid masses are about an order of magnitude below those in Lupus and Ophiuchus, while the dust spectral index suggests some level of dust evolution. These empirical findings align with a combination of radial drift, dust trapping, and grain growth into larger bodies. A moderate correlation between CO and continuum fluxes suggests a link between gas and dust content, through the increased scatter compared to younger regions, possibly due to age variations, gas-to-dust ratio differences, or CO depletion. Additionally, the correlation between C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes observed in Lupus persists in Upper Sco, indicating a relatively stable CO gas abundance over the Class II stage of disk evolution. In conclusion, the AGE-PRO survey of Upper Scorpius disks reveals intriguing trends in disk evolution. The findings point towards potential gas evolution and the presence of dust traps in these older disks. Future high-resolution observations are needed to confirm these possibilities and further refine our understanding of disk evolution and planet formation in older environments.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of the gas mass of planet-forming disks around young stars is crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time, from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (&lt;1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4 Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6 Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120, suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VI. Comparison of Dust Evolution Models to AGE-PRO Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth, weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$, suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VII. Testing accretion mechanisms from disk population synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The architecture of planetary systems depends on the evolution of the disks in which they form. In this work, we develop a population synthesis approach to interpret the AGE-PRO measurements of disk gas mass and size considering two scenarios: turbulence-driven evolution with photoevaporative winds and MHD disk-wind-driven evolution. A systematic method is proposed to constrain the distribution of disk parameters from the disk fractions, accretion rates, disk gas masses, and CO gas sizes. We find that turbulence-driven accretion with initially compact disks ($R_0 \simeq 5-20~$au), low mass-loss rates, and relatively long viscous timescales ($t_{\nu,0} \simeq 0.4-3~$Myr or $\alpha_{SS} \simeq 2-4 \times 10^{-4}$) can reproduce the disk fraction and gas sizes. However, the distribution of apparent disk lifetime defined as the $M_D/\dot{M}_*$ ratio is severely overestimated by turbulence-driven models. On the other hand, MHD wind-driven accretion can reproduce the bulk properties of the disk populations from Ophiuchus to Upper Sco assuming compact disks with an initial magnetization of about $\beta \simeq 10^5$ ($\alpha_{DW} \simeq 0.5-1 \times 10^{-3}$) and a magnetic field that declines with time. More studies are needed to confirm the low masses found by AGE-PRO, notably for compact disks that question turbulence-driven accretion. The constrained synthetic disk populations can now be used for realistic planet population models to interpret the properties of planetary systems on a statistical basis.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): VIII. The impact of external photoevaporation on disk masses and radii in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk evolution can be deeply influenced by the UV radiation emitted by neighboring massive stars (mainly of spectral type O and B). We show that the process of external photoevaporation, which causes an outside-in depletion of disk material due to environmental UV radiation, can lead to a significant decrease in disk size, and moderate in disk mass and lifetime even at moderate irradiation levels (1-10 G$_{0}$). In this work we investigate the role of external photoevaporation in shaping the masses and sizes of the ten AGE-PRO disks in the Upper Scorpius region, which we estimate to be subject to FUV fluxes ranging between 2 and 12 G$_{0}$, on average. We compare the disk masses and sizes resulting from 1D numerical viscous evolution simulations in which the effect of external photoevaporation is included, to the values retrieved from the AGE-PRO observations. While the pure viscous framework fails in adequately explaining the observed disk properties in Upper Scorpius, with the inclusion of external photoevaporation we can successfully reproduce gas disk sizes for 7 out of 10 sources within a factor &lt;2, when the initial disk mass is 1-10% of the stellar mass. We emphasize the importance of accounting for the environmental irradiation when comparing star-forming regions of different ages, even when moderate FUV irradiation fields are experienced, as in the case of Upper Scorpius.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): X. Dust Substructures, Disk Geometries, and Dust-disk Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform visibility fitting to the dust continuum Band 6 1.3 mm data of the 30 protoplanetary disks in the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. We obtain disk geometries, dust-disk radii, and azimuthally symmetric radial profiles of the intensity of the dust continuum emission. We examine the presence of continuum substructures in the AGE-PRO sample by using these radial profiles and their residuals. We detect substructures in 15 out of 30 disks. We report five disks with large ($&gt;$15 au) inner dust cavities. The Ophiuchus Class I disks show dust-disk substructures in $\sim80\%$ of the resolved sources. This evidences the early formation of substructures in protoplanetary disks. A spiral is identified in IRS 63, hinting to gravitational instability in this massive disk. We compare our dust-disk brightness radial profiles with gas-disk brightness radial profiles and discuss colocal substructures in both tracers. In addition, we discuss the evolution of dust-disk radii and substructures across Ophiuchus, Lupus, and Upper Scorpius. We find that disks in Lupus and Upper Scorpius with large inner dust cavities have typical gas-disk masses, suggesting an abundance of dust cavities in these regions. The prevalence of pressure dust traps at later ages is supported by a potential trend with time with more disks with large inner dust cavities (or "transition disks") in Upper Scorpius and the absence of evolution of dust-disk sizes with time in the AGE-PRO sample. We propose this is caused by an evolutionary sequence with a high fraction of protoplanetary disks with inner protoplanets carving dust cavities.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XI. Beam-corrected gas disk sizes from fitting 12CO moment zero maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inward drift of mm-cm sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks has become an important part of our current theories of planet formation and, more recently, planet composition as well. The gas-to-dust size ratio of protoplanetary disks can provide an important constraint on how pebbles have drifted inward provided that observational effects, especially resolution, can be accounted for. Here we present a method for fitting beam-convolved models to integrated intensity maps of line emission using the astropy python package and use it to fit 12 CO moment zero maps of ten Lupus and ten Upper Scorpius protoplanetary disks from the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program, a sample of disks around M3-K6 stars that cover the ~1 to 6 Myr of gas disk evolution. From the unconvolved best fit models we measure the gas disk size (RCO,90%[model]), which we combine with the dust disk size (Rdust,90%[FRANK]) from continuum visibility fits from Vioque et al. (2025, in press.) to compute beam-corrected gas-to-dust size ratios. In our sample we find gas-to-dust size ratios between ~1 and ~5.5, with a median value of 2.78(+0.37,-0.32). Contrary to models of dust evolution that predict an increasing size ratio with time, we find that the younger disks in Lupus have similar (or even larger) median ratios (3.02(+0.33,-0.33)) than the older disks in Upper Sco (2.46(+0.53,-0.38)). A possible explanation to this discrepancy is that pebble drift is halted in dust traps combined with truncation of the gas disk by external photo-evaporation in Upper Sco, although survivorship bias could also play a role.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks (AGE-PRO): XII. Extreme millimetre variability detected in a Class II disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions. We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1) emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object, the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar surface or a strong accretion burst.</description>

      <title>Four ages of rotating stars in the rotation--activity relationship and gyrochronology</title>

Abstract: Gyrochronology and the rotation--activity relationship are standard techniques used to determine the evolution phase.The mismatch in the definition of the evolutionary phases has so far raised many issues in physics and mathematics and hampered the understanding of how the internal dynamo processes affect the observable properties.To address this problem, we seek a unified scheme that shows a one-to-one mapping from gyrochronology to the rotation--activity relationship.We obtained the chromospheric activity $R'_{\rm HK}$ of 6846 stars and their rotation periods to investigate the rotation--activity relationship.We apply a three-interval model to fit the relationship and find that it is best fitted by three intervals in the range of Ro$&lt;0.7$.We associate those intervals to the convective, gap and interface phases of gyrochronology.Furthermore,we suggest an additional epoch at late times of the I phase.We further use the three-interval models to fit the period--activity relationship in temperature bins and determine the duration of the transition phase as a function of effective temperature.By comparing the critical temperature and period of the g-to-I transition with the slowly rotating sequence of 10 young open clusters whose ages range from 1 Myr to 2.5 Gyr, we conclude that our new model finds the pure I sequence without fast rotating outliers, which defines the zero-age I sequence (ZAIS).We propose that there is an ambiguous consensus on when the I sequence starts to work.This ambiguity is from the visually convergent sequence of the color--period diagrams in open clusters.This visually convergent sequence is younger than the ZAIS and is actually the pre-I sequence that can be associated with the stall of the spin-down. Our results unify the rotation--activity relationship and gyrochonology for the stellar evolution of low-mass stars, for which we coined the ``CgIW" scenario.</description>

Abstract: Be stars are rapidly rotating stars surrounded by a disc; however, the origin of these stars remains unclear. Mass and angular momentum transfer in close binaries account for the rapid rotation of a major fraction of Be stars, as supported by the previous detection of low-mass stripped companions to these stars. The stripped companions can be helium-burning subdwarf OB-type stars (sdOBs) and white dwarfs. The main objective of this study is to characterise the identified Be stars in the young open cluster NGC 663 and search for possible hot companions. We present the first ultraviolet (UV) photometric study of NGC 663 using far-UV and near-UV data from UVIT/AstroSat as a part of the UOCS series (XVIII). We identified 23 previously known Be stars in the cluster. Further, we utilised the spectral energy distribution fitting technique to derive the fundamental parameters and to search for UV-bright companions of the identified Be stars. Our study reveals that 19 out of 23 Be stars show a significant UV excess, indicating the presence of hot companions. Here, we report the first detection of high-mass sdOB companions to Be stars, with 69.5% of them found in binaries within a cluster, offering direct evidence of binary interactions. This study showcases the key role of binary interactions in the formation of Be stars in clusters and provides insights into massive star evolution.</description>

      <title>A candidate giant planet companion to the massive, young white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139 informs the occurrence of giant planets orbiting B stars</title>

Abstract: It has been suggested that giant planet occurrence peaks for stars with $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ at a value a factor of 4 higher than observed for solar-mass stars. This population of giant planets predicted to frequently orbit main-sequence B stars at $a$ ~ 10au is difficult to characterize during the few hundred million years while fusion persists in their host stars. By the time those stars become massive, young white dwarfs, any giant planets present would still be luminous as a consequence of their recent formation. From an initial sample of 2195 Gaia-identified massive, young white dwarfs, we use homogeneous Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry to search for evidence of unresolved giant planets. For 30 systems, these IRAC data provide sensitivity to objects with $M~\lesssim$ 10 $M_{\text{Jup}}$, and we identify one candidate with ~ 4 $M_{\text{Jup}}$ orbiting the white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139. Correcting for the possibility that some of the white dwarfs in our sample result from mergers, we find a giant planet occurrence $\eta_{\text{GP}}~=~0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.13}$ for stars with initial masses $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$. Our occurrence inference is consistent with both the Doppler-inferred occurrence of giant planets orbiting 2 $M_{\odot}$ giant stars and the theoretically predicted factor of 4 enhancement in the occurrence of giant planets orbiting 3 $M_{\odot}$ stars relative to solar-mass stars. Future James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam observations of our sample would provide sensitivity to Saturn-mass planets and thereby a definitive estimate of the occurrence of giant planets orbiting stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum of stars reflects the relationship between star-forming environment and galactic evolution history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on stars with masses above the Kraft break in the \textit{Kepler} field. Their rotational angular momenta are essentially the same as those at the zero-age main sequence. The angular momentum dissipation experienced by these stars during their pre-main sequence phase is also relatively weak, so their rotational angular momentum can reflect the parameters of their parental molecular clouds. The reliability of angular momentum measurements was evaluated based on the phenomenon of angular momentum conservation observed in stars before and after the turn-off point in observational data. We find that stars with masses between 1.4$M_\odot$ and 1.8$M_\odot$ show an inverse proportionality between angular momentum and isochrone age. We propose that the angular momentum-age correlation reflects changes in the star-forming environment in the Milky Way's history. Besides, the observed inverse proportionality implies that, as the Milky Way has evolved, the stars formed within it tend to possess greater rotational angular momenta. This trend would promote the fragmentation of stars during the pre-main sequence phase and inhibit the formation of massive stars, providing a useful perspective for explaining variations in the initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. The analysis is restricted to orbits confined to the reflection-symmetric plane of the spheroidal configuration. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for Collective Neutrino Instability: Fast, Slow, and Mixed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations exhibit instabilities that induce appreciable flavor conversion, with crucial astrophysical implications. While the importance of initial phase-space distributions is well-established, a general instability criterion for distributions dependent on both energy and emission angle has been lacking. We identify and analyze the sufficient (and necessary) conditions for a generic collective neutrino flavor instability.</description>

      <title>Non-transiting exoplanets as a means of understanding star-planet interactions in close-in systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies showed evidence of a dearth of close-in exoplanets around fast rotators, which can be explained by the combined action of intense tidal and magnetic interactions between planets and their host star. Detecting more exoplanets experiencing such interactions, with orbits evolving on short timescales, is therefore crucial to improve our understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms. For this purpose, we performed a new search for close-in non-transiting substellar companions in the Kepler data, focusing on orbital periods below 2.3 days. We focused on main-sequence solar-type stars and subgiant stars for which a surface rotation period was measured. For each star, we looked for an excess in the power spectral density of the light curve, which could correspond to the signature of a close-in non-transiting companion. We compared our candidates with existing catalogues to eliminate potential contaminants in our sample, and we visually inspected the phase-folded light curve and its wavelet decomposition. We identify 88 stars exhibiting a signature consistent with the presence of a close non-transiting substellar companion. We show that the objects in our sample are located mostly within the dearth zone, emphasising the importance of performing follow-up of such systems in order to gather observational evidence of star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>Abundance Effects from Protoplanetary Disk Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun; solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material, with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries. It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the convection zones of the stars.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Visual Binary TOI-6883AB and its dynamical implications for the planetary companion TOI-6883Ab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that TOI-6883 is a physically bound visual binary system composed of two solar-type stars, TOI-6883A (TIC 393818343) and TOI-6883B (TIC 393818340), initially regarded as a single star hosting the exoplanet TOI-6883b. Gaia DR3 astrometry shows that both stars have nearly identical parallaxes 10.6 mas, consistent proper motions, and a projected separation of 616 AU, confirming their binary nature. Using astrometric and photometric data, we estimate the stellar masses, physical separation, and an orbital period of 15,000 years. The system is energetically bound. We revise the planet designation to TOI-6883Ab to reflect stellar multiplicity. We evaluate the impact of the binary companion on planetary stability and find the planet's orbit to be long-term stable, although Kozai-Lidov perturbations remain possible. Further astrometric and photometric follow-up will be essential to better constrain the binary orbit and assess potential dynamical influences on the planetary architecture.</description>
