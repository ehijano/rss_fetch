      <title>Static and dynamic ordering of magnetic repelling particles under confinement: disks vs bars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored experimentally the self-organization at rest and the compression dynamics of a two-dimensional array of magnetic repelling particles, using two particle geometries, namely, disks and rectangular bars. Despite the non-contact interaction, typical static features of granular materials are observed for both particle shapes: pile formation with an angle of repose and pressure saturation (Janssen-like effect), which can be explained by considering the magnetically-induced torques that generate friction between particles and confining walls. Particle shape effects are mainly observed during compression: while disks rearrange increasing the hexagonal ordering, bars augment their orientational ordering forming larger non-contact force chains; however, in both cases, the resistance to compression rises continuously, in contrast with the fluctuating compression dynamics (stick-slip motion or periodic oscillations) that characterizes granular systems with inter-particle contacts. The continuous response to compression, and the reduction of particle wear due to non-contact interactions, are desirable features in designing magnetic granular dampers.</description>

      <title>Exploring global landscape of free energy for the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing the complex landscape of infinite-dimensional free energy is generally a challenging problem. This difficulty arises from the existence of numerous minimizers and, consequently, a vast number of saddle points. These factors make it challenging to predict the location of desired configurations or to forecast the trajectories and pathways leading from an initial condition to the final state. In contrast, experimental observations demonstrate that specific morphologies can be reproducibly obtained in high yield under controlled conditions, even amidst noise. This study investigates the possibility of elucidating the global structure of the free energy landscape and enabling the control of orbits toward desired minimizers without relying on exhaustive brute-force methods. Furthermore, it seeks to mathematically explain the efficacy of certain experimental setups in achieving high-yield outcomes. Focusing on the phase separation of two polymers in a solvent, we conduct a one-dimensional analysis that reveals the global free energy landscape and relaxation-parameter-dependent trajectory behaviors. Two key methodologies are developed: one is a saddle point search method, akin to bifurcation tracking. This method aims to comprehensively identify all saddle points. The other is a strategy that adjusts the relaxation parameters preceding each variable's time derivative, aligning with experimental setups. This approach enables control over trajectory behaviors toward desired structures, overcoming the limitations of steepest descent methods. By tuning these relaxation parameters, uncertainties in trajectory behavior due to inevitable fluctuations can be suppressed. These methodologies collectively offer a mathematical framework that mirrors experimental high-yield phenomena, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gigantic dynamical spreading and anomalous diffusion of jerky active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jerky active particles are Brownian self-propelled particles which are dominated by ``jerk'', the change in acceleration. They represent a generalization of inertial active particles. In order to describe jerky active particles, a linear jerk equation of motion which involves a third-order derivative in time, Stokes friction and a spring force is combined with activity modeled by an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This equation of motion is solved analytically and the associated mean-square displacement (MSD) is extracted as a function of time. For small damping and small spring constants, the MSD shows an enormous superballistic spreading with different scaling regimes characterized by anomalous high dynamical exponents 6, 5, 4 or 3 arising from a competition between jerk, inertia and activity. When exposed to a harmonic potential, the gigantic spreading tendency induced by jerk gives rise to an enormous increase of the kinetic temperature and even to a sharp localization-delocalization transition, i.e. a jerky particle can escape from harmonic confinement. The transition can be either first or second order as a function of jerkiness. Finally it is shown that self-propelled jerky particles governed by the basic equation of motion can be realized experimentally both in feedback-controlled macroscopic particles and in active colloids governed by friction with memory.</description>

      <title>Contact Forces in Motility-Regulated Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range interactions are ubiquitous in nature, where they are mediated by diffusive fields at the cellular scale or by visual cues for groups of animals. Short-range forces, which are paradigmatic in physics, can thus often be neglected when modeling the collective behaviors of biological systems induced by mediated interactions. However, when self-organization leads to the emergence of dense phases, we show that excluded-volume interactions play an important and versatile role. We consider assemblies of active particles that undergo either condensation or phase-separation due to motility regulation and show that short-range repulsive forces can induce opposite effects. When motility regulation triggers an absorbing phase transition, such as a chemotactic collapse, repulsive forces opposes the formation of condensates and stabilize the coexistence between finite-density phases. In contrast, when motility regulation induces liquid-gas coexistence, repulsive forces can, counterintuitively, lead to a significant increase in the liquid density.</description>

      <title>Electrostatically Assembled Open Square and Checkerboard Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable assembly of nanoparticles into structures other than hexagonal lattices remains challenging. Assembling an open checkerboard or square lattice is harder to achieve compared to a close-packed hexagonal structure. Here, we introduce a unified, robust approach to assemble nanoparticles into a diverse family of two-dimensional superlattices at the liquid-air interface. Gold nanoparticles are grafted with pH-responsive, water-soluble poly(ethylene glycol) chains terminating in -COOH or -NH2 end groups, enabling control over interparticle interactions, while the grafted polymer's molecular weight dictates its conformation. This combined control crystallizes checkerboard, simple-square, and body-centered honeycomb superlattices. We find that even for identical nanoparticle core sizes, the polymer's molecular weight dictates superlattice symmetry and stability. Furthermore, tuning pH induces structural transitions between different lattice types. This method opens new avenues for the programmable fabrication of colloidal superstructures with tailored architectures.</description>

      <title>On failure mechanisms and load-parallel cracking in confined elastomeric layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin layers of elastomers bonded to two rigid plates demonstrate unusual failure response. Historically, it has been believed that strongly-bonded layers fail by two distinct mechanisms: (i) internal/external penny-shaped crack nucleation and propagation, and (ii) cavitation, that is, cavity growth leading to fibrillation and then failure. However, recent work has demonstrated that cavitation itself is predominantly a fracture process. While the equations describing cavitation from a macroscopic or top-down view are now known and validated with experiments, several aspects of the cavitation crack growth need to be better understood. Notably, cavitation often involves through-thickness crack growth parallel to the loading direction, raising questions about when it initiates instead of the more typical penny-shaped cracks perpendicular to the load. Understanding and controlling the two vertical and horizontal crack growth is key to developing tougher soft films and adhesives. The purpose of this Letter is to provide an explanation for the load-parallel crack growth through a comprehensive numerical analysis and highlight the role of various material and geometrical parameters.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of shear bands in 2D amorphous solids from topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of shear bands in amorphous solids such as glasses has remained an open question in our understanding of condensed matter and amorphous materials. Unlike in crystals, well-defined topological defects such as dislocations have been elusive due to the lack of a periodic ordered background at the atomic level. Recently, topological defects have been identified in the displacement field and in the eigenvectors of amorphous solids. Recent work has suggested that shear bands in amorphous solids coincide with an alignment of vortex-antivortex dipoles, with alternating topological charge +1/-1. Here we numerically confirm this hypothesis by means of well-controlled simulations in 2D. Surprisingly, we show that a chain of topological defects (TDs) pre-exists the shear band and is visible already in the non-affine displacement field of the elastic regime. This chain is activated into a flow band concomitantly with the disappearance and possibly annihilation of a dipole at a distance from the TDs chain. The possible underlying mechanism is reminiscent of a soliton-like rarefaction pulse remotely activated by dipole annihilation as observed in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Scattering of Polydisperse Hard Spheres using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a deep learning approach for analyzing the scattering function of the polydisperse hard spheres system. We use a variational autoencoder-based neural network to learn the bidirectional mapping between the scattering function and the system parameters including the volume fraction and polydispersity. Such that the trained model serves both as a generator that produce scattering function from the system parameters, and an inferrer that extract system parameters from the scattering function. We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulation of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then we split the dataset into training and testing set and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produce scattering function with significant higher accuracy comparing to the traditional Percus-Yevick approximation and $\beta$ correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.</description>

      <title>Variational Formulation of Local Molecular Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the Local Molecular Field theory of Weeks et. al. can be re-derived as an extremum problem for an approximate Helmholtz free energy. Using the resulting free energy as a classical, fluid density functional yields an implicit solvent method identical in form to the Molecular Density Functional theory of Borgis et. al., but with an explicit formula for the 'ideal' free energy term. This new expression for the ideal free energy term can be computed from all-atom molecular dynamics of a solvent with only short-range interactions. The key hypothesis required to make the theory valid is that all smooth (and hence long-range) energy functions obey Gaussian statistics. This is essentially a random phase approximation for perturbations from a short-range only, 'reference,' fluid. This single hypothesis is enough to prove that the self-consistent LMF procedure minimizes a novel density functional whose 'ideal' free energy is the molecular system under a specific, reference Hamiltonian, as opposed to the non-interacting gas of conventional density functionals. Implementation of this new functional into existing software should be straightforward and robust.</description>

      <title>Leakage at interfaces: a comprehensive study based on Persson contact mechanics theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of gas leakage at interfaces based on Persson contact mechanics theory. A prototype syringe system consisting of a rubber stopper and a glass barrel is selected, where surface roughness is characterized using measurements from stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy, and contact pressure distributions are obtained from Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations. Leakage prediction is performed using Multiscale Contact Mechanics (MCM) software. The predicted results show good agreement with experimental measurements under controlled dry conditions. Sensitivity analyses indicate that small variations in elastic modulus and contact pressure can significantly influence leakage, particularly near the percolation threshold. This work provides a generalized and validated framework for leakage prediction and offers practical guidance for the design of sealing systems in pharmaceutical and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Study of surface roughness modulation on the adhesion behavior of PDMS elastomer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adhesion control at the interface of two surfaces is crucial in various applications, including the design of micro- and nanodevices such as microfluidic devices, triboelectric nanogenerators, biochips, and electronic sensors. Several factors influence adhesion, including sample preparation, surface energy, mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity, and surface texture or roughness. This study specifically investigates the effect of surface roughness on the adhesion behavior of the elastomer polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), focusing on a complementary interface with identical roughness. To create surface roughness, sandpapers with grit sizes ranging from N = 120 to N = 2000 were used during the molding process. The surface roughness of the PDMS elastomer was then characterized using a stylus profilometer. Interfacial adhesion was evaluated through wedge test experiments, which enabled the analysis of the relationship between surface roughness, work of adhesion, and equilibrium crack length. Furthermore, the study also explores the correlation between the real area of contact and the work of adhesion.</description>

      <title>From Spheres to Cones: Structural Instabilities and Acidity at Conical Regions in Trivalent Metal Ion Nano-clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-nanometer aqueous clusters containing a single trivalent metal cation can exhibit charge-induced structural instabilities. Here, we present computational evidence that clusters containing a single \ce{Fe^{3+}}, \ce{Lu^{3+}}, or \ce{La^{3+}} ion undergo continuous geometric transformations as a consequence of this instability. These clusters dynamically evolve across their potential energy landscape, adopting triangular, elongated two-point, single-point, and more spherical configurations often with distinct conical surface protrusions. The manifestation of this instability differs from that observed in mesoscopic and microscopic droplets containing macroions, where stable ``star-like'' structures form, characterized by a specific number of conical protrusions that varies with the droplet size. In the present study, we find that the orientation of the \ce{H2O} molecules surrounding the metal ion is influenced not only by the electric field of the trivalent ion but also by the local conical protrusions. To further investigate the local acidity in the conical protrusions, we employ a proxy model system consisting of an aqueous nano-cluster containing three \ce{H3O+} ions, simulated using ab initio molecular dynamics. Within the conical regions of the cluster, protons exhibit diffusion across several water molecules, in contrast to the more localized proton delocalization observed in the compact body of the cluster. These findings suggest that local geometry can significantly modulate acidity in highly charged nano-clusters, with potential implications for understanding charge-transfer and ionization mechanisms in techniques such as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and complement interpretations from infrared spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Active anisotropic diffusion of microparticles in nematic lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal powered by light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the diffusion dynamics of a Brownian microparticle in a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal (LCLC). In the planarly oriented nematic phase, the microparticle exhibits levitation and anisotropic two-dimensional diffusion. Upon illumination with light resonant with the absorption spectrum of the solution, we observe a transition to active anisotropic diffusion, driven by the disruption of the molecular stacking in the liquid crystal. Notably, while light absorption increases both the molecular kinetic energy and the overall temperature of the solution, it manifests at the microscopic level as anisotropic active diffusion of the microparticles, revealing a novel light-driven non-equilibrium transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Inference of time delay in stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</description>

Abstract: We predict a phenomenon of catastrophic material failure arising suddenly within an amorphous material, with an extremely long delay time since the material was last deformed. By simulating a mesoscopic soft glassy rheology model in one dimension (1D), a mesoscopic elastoplastic model in 1D and 2D, and a continuum fluidity model in 1D, we demonstrate the basic physics to involve a dramatic ultra-delayed shear banding instability, in which strain suddenly strongly localises within the material and the stress drops precipitously. The delay time after the long historical shear strain was applied before failure occurs increases steeply with decreasing strain amplitude, decreasing working temperature, and increasing sample annealing prior to shear. In demonstrating the same physics -- which is directly testable experimentally and in particle simulations -- to obtain within three different constitutive models, we suggest it may be generic across amorphous materials. The counter-intuitive prediction of catastrophic material failure long after any deformation was last applied could have important consequences for material processing and performance.</description>

      <title>The Mechanics of Nucleation and Growth and the Surface Tensions of Active Matter</title>

Abstract: Homogeneous nucleation, a textbook transition path for phase transitions, is typically understood on thermodynamic grounds through the prism of classical nucleation theory. However, recent studies have suggested the applicability of classical nucleation theory to systems far from equilibrium. In this Article, we formulate a purely mechanical perspective of homogeneous nucleation and growth, elucidating the criteria for the properties of a critical nucleus without appealing to equilibrium notions. Applying this theory to active fluids undergoing motility-induced phase separation, we find that nucleation proceeds in a qualitatively similar fashion to equilibrium systems, with concepts such as the Gibbs-Thomson effect and nucleation barriers remaining valid. We further demonstrate that the recovery of such concepts allows us to extend classical theories of nucleation rates and coarsening dynamics to active systems upon using the mechanically-derived definitions of the nucleation barrier and surface tensions. Three distinct surface tensions -- the mechanical, capillary, and Ostwald tensions -- play a central role in our theory. While these three surface tensions are identical in equilibrium, our work highlights the distinctive role of each tension in the stability of active interfaces and the nucleation and growth of motility-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Simulation of charged nanotubes self-assembly during evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate</title>

Abstract: The ability to control the morphology of the nanotube deposit formed during the evaporation of a sessile droplet on a substrate is of theoretical and practical interest. Such deposits are required for various applications including nanotechnology, medicine, biotechnology, and optronics. In the experiment of Zhao et al. [J. Colloid Interface Sci. 440, 68 (2015)], an annular deposit was formed near the contact line. The deposition geometry is caused by the coffee ring effect. This deposit is unusual in its morphology. It changes gradually in space from a disordered structure in the inner part of the ring to an aligned structure of nanotubes close to the periphery. To understand the mechanisms that lead to this, we have developed a mathematical model that takes into account the effects of advection, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions on particle transport. Results of numerical calculations have confirmed that all these factors together have an influence on the formation of such a variable morphology. Qualitative agreement with the experiment is shown for some values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Re-orientational dynamics of ring polymers in dilute solutions</title>

Abstract: Advances in controlled polymerization have enabled the synthesis of mechanically interlocked polymers like molecular knots and linear[n]catenane. These aesthetic macromolecules with unique topological constraints in the form of mechanical bonds are well known for their fascinating transport and rheological properties in the development of molecular machines and in knotted protein dynamics in biological applications. The diffusion dynamics of such macromolecular structures with large internal degrees of freedom are generally studied by using an equivalent size parameter, i.e., hydrodynamic radius, defined using Zimm theory. Although diffusion rates are expected to depend strongly on the molecular topological constraints in macromolecules, their explicit effects on translational and reorientational dynamics are still unknown. Here, we perform an in silico study on the diffusion dynamics of seven topologically distinct polymer chains in the limit of infinite dilution using multi-particle collision dynamics. The modeled polymers are linear, ring, linear[2]catenane, trefoil knot, linear[3]catenane, cyclic[3]catenane, and Borromean ring. The molecular weights of these macromolecules are selected such that the resulting hydrodynamic radius is approximately equal to each other. We show that while the translational diffusion coefficients of these topologically distinct polymer chains are approximately equal to each other in agreement with the Zimm theory, there are significant differences among the values of the corresponding rotational diffusion coefficients. We show that the presence of mechanical bonds in the polymer chains slows down the rotational diffusion significantly, thus suggesting the role of molecular topology on reaction kinetics of macromolecules.</description>

      <title>Dynamic self-loops in networks of passive and active binary elements</title>

Abstract: Models of coupled binary elements capture memory effects in complex dissipative materials, such as transient responses or sequential computing, when their interactions are chosen appropriately. However, for random interactions, self-loops - cyclic transition sequences incompatible with dissipative dynamics - dominate the response and undermine statistical approaches. Here we reveal that self-loops originate from energy injection and limit cycles in the underlying physical system. We furthermore introduce interaction ensembles that strongly suppress or completely eliminate self-loops, allowing statistical studies of memory in large dissipative systems. Our work opens a route towards a unified description of passive and active multistable materials using hysteron models.</description>

      <title>Soft ULC Microgels at the Interface Interact and Flow as Hertzian-Like Colloids</title>

Abstract: Soft pair potentials predict a reentrant liquid phase for high concentrations, a behavior not observed experimentally. Here, very soft microgels confined at an oil-water interface are used as a model system of particles interacting via a soft potential in 2D. Interfacial rheology measurements demonstrate the existence of different flow regimes that depend on the compression of the monolayer. Such a compression also leads to a non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli and of the yield stress of the monolayer. These results, together with the equilibrium phase behavior of the monolayer, are reproduced in molecular dynamics simulations of a 2D system of particles interacting with a Hertzian-like potential. Remarkably, due to the non-monotonic variation of the elastic moduli, we observe \textit{isoelastic} points where the monolayer shows the same stiffness at very different concentrations. These points are the experimental manifestation of the predicted reentrant liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Elasticity of a Freely Jointed Chain with Quenched Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simple theoretical model, the Freely Jointed Chain with quenched hinges (qFJC), which captures the quenched disorder in the local bending stiffness of the polymer. In this article, we analyze the tensile elasticity of the qFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. For finite-size systems, we obtain a recurrence relation of the exact free energy, which allows us to calculate the exact force-extension relation numerically for an arbitrary size of the system. In the thermodynamic limit, when $L({\rm contour \;length})\gg L_p({\rm persistence \;length})$, we obtain a framework to deal with quenched disorder in the polymer configuration. This allows us to obtain the response function for the discrete and continuous qFJC in the thermodynamic limit. It turns out that the extension of the continuous qFJC can be cast in a simple form. Furthermore, we have applied our analysis to rod-coil multiblock copolymers.</description>

      <title>A Rigorous Foundation for Stochastic Thermodynamics via the Microcanonical Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a small Hamiltonian system strongly interacting with a much larger Hamiltonian system (the bath), while being driven by both a time-dependent control parameter and non-conservative forces. The joint system is assumed to be thermally isolated. Under the assumption of time-scale separation (TSS)--where the bath equilibrates much faster than the system and the external driving--the bath remains in instantaneous equilibrium, described by the microcanonical ensemble conditioned on the system state and the control parameter. We identify a decomposition of the total Hamiltonian that renders the bath energy an adiabatic invariant under slow evolution. This same decomposition defines the system Hamiltonian as the Hamiltonian of mean force, and ensures that neither the system nor the control parameter does reactive work on the bath. Using time-reversal symmetry and TSS, and without invoking any model details, we rigorously prove that the reduced dynamics of the system is Markovian and satisfies a form of local detailed balance (LDB) which involves transition probabilities but not path probabilities. By working entirely within the microcanonical framework and adopting a precise decomposition of the total energy, we provide rigorous definitions of bath entropy as the Boltzmann entropy, and of heat as the negative change of the bath energy. Our approach bypasses the ambiguities associated with conventional definitions of thermodynamic variables and path probabilities, and establishes a rigorous and thermodynamically consistent foundation for stochastic thermodynamics, valid even under strong system-bath coupling.</description>
