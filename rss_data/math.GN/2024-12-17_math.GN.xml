      <title>Constructing Psuedo-$\tau$-fine Precompact Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\tau$ be an uncountable cardinal. The notion of a \emph{$\tau$-fine} topological group was introduced in 2021. More recently, H. Zhang et al. generalized this concept by defining pseudo-$\tau$-fine topological groups to study certain factorization properties of continuous functions on topological groups. It is known that $\tau$-fineness cannot coexist with precompactness in topological groups with uncountable character. In this paper, we investigate this problem further. We prove that, in topological groups with uncountable pseudocharacter, precompactness can coexist with pseudo-$\tau$-fineness for some bounded $\tau$ but pseudocompactness can never.</description>

      <title>Stone-Cech extensions of probability measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is proved that $P(\beta X)=\beta P(X)$ if and only if $P(X)$ is a pseudocompact space, where $P(X)$ is the space of probability Radon measures with weak topology and $\beta X$ is a Stone-Cech extension of the space $X$. A locally compact pseudocompact space $X$ is constructed such that $P(X)$ is not pseudocompact. Conditions are obtained under which $P(X)$ is pseudocompact.</description>

      <title>Machine Proofs for Adams Differentials and Extension Problems among CW Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this document, we describe the process of obtaining numerous Adams differentials and extensions using computational methods, as well as how to interpret the dataset uploaded to Zenodo. Detailed proofs of the machine-generated results are also provided. The dataset includes information on 210 CW spectra, 624 maps, and 98 cofiber sequences. Leveraging these results, and with the addition of some ad hoc arguments derived through human insight, we successfully resolved the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem in dimension 126.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Without Open Sets: A Net Approach to Homotopy Theory in Limit Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence spaces are a generalization of topological spaces. The category of convergence spaces is well-suited for Algebraic Topology, one of the reasons is the existence of exponential objects provided by continuous convergence. In this work, we use a net-theoretic approach to convergence spaces. The goal is to simplify the description of continuous convergence and apply it to problems related to homotopy theory. We present methods to develop the basis of homotopy theory in limit spaces, define the fundamental groupoid, and prove the groupoid version of the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem for limit spaces.</description>

      <title>Asplund spaces and the finest locally convex topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper we systematized several known equivalent definitions of Fr\'echet (G\^ ateaux) Differentiability Spaces and Asplund (weak Asplund) Spaces. As an application, we extended the classical Mazur's theorem, and also proved that the product of any family of Banach spaces $(E_{\alpha})$ is an Asplund lcs if and only if each $E_{\alpha}$ is Asplund. The actual work continues this line of research in the frame of locally convex spaces, including the classes of Fr\'echet spaces (i.e. metrizable and complete locally convex spaces) and projective limits, quojections, $(LB)$-spaces and $(LF)$-spaces, as well as, the class of free locally convex spaces $L(X)$ over Tychonoff spaces $X$.
  First we prove some "negative" results: We show that for every infinite Tychonoff space $X$ the space $L(X)$ is not even a G\^ ateaux Differentiability Space (GDS in short) and contains no infinite-dimensional Baire vector subspaces.
  On the other hand, we show that all barrelled GDS spaces are quasi-Baire spaces, what implies that strict $(LF)$-spaces are not GDS. This fact refers, for example, to concrete important spaces
  $D^{m}(\Omega)$, $D(\Omega)$, $D(\mathbb{R}^{\omega})$.
  A special role of the space $\varphi$, i.e. an $\aleph_{0}$-dimensional vector space equipped with the finest locally convex topology, in this line of research has been distinguished and analysed. It seems that little is known about the Asplund property for Fr\'echet spaces. We show however that a quojection $E$, i.e. a Fr\'echet space which is a strict projective limit of the corresponding Banach spaces $E_n$, is an Asplund (weak Asplund) space if and only if each
  Banach space $E_n$ is Asplund (weak Asplund). In particular, every reflexive quojection is Asplund.
  Some applications and several illustrating examples are provided.</description>

      <title>Generic properties of minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an open Riemann surface and $n\ge 3$ be an integer. In this paper we establish some generic properties (in Baire category sense) in the space of all conformal minimal immersions $M\to\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the compact-open topology, pointing out that a generic such immersion is chaotic in many ways. For instance, we show that a generic conformal minimal immersion $u\colon M\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is non-proper, almost proper, and $g$-complete with respect to any given Riemannian metric $g$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Further, its image $u(M)$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and disjoint from $\mathbb{Q}^3\times \mathbb{R}^{n-3}$, and has infinite area, infinite total curvature, and unbounded curvature on every open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$. In case $n=3$, we also prove that a generic conformal minimal immersion $M\to\mathbb{R}^3$ has infinite index of stability on every open set in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>
