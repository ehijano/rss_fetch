      <title>Direct electrical access to the spin manifolds of individual monovalent lanthanide atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lanthanide atoms show long magnetic lifetimes because of their strongly localized 4f electrons, but electrical control of their spins has been difficult because of their closed valence shell configurations. We achieved electron spin resonance of individual lanthanide atoms using a scanning tunneling microscope to probe the atoms bound to a protective insulating film. These atoms were prepared in the monovalent state with an unpaired 6s electron, enabling tunnel current to access their 4f electrons. Europium spectra display a rich array of transitions among the 54 combined electron and nuclear spin states. In contrast, samarium's ground state is a Kramers doublet with an extraordinarily large g-factor of nearly 5. These results demonstrate that all-electronic sensing and control of individual lanthanide spins is possible for quantum devices and spin-based electronics by using their rarely-observed monovalent cation state.</description>

      <title>Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetite(001)/water interface from molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetite/water interface is commonly found in nature and plays a crucial role in various technological applications. However, our understanding of its structural and dynamical properties at the molecular scale remains still limited. In this study, we develop an efficient Behler-Parrinello neural network potential (NNP) for the magnetite/water system, paying particular attention to the accurate generation of reference data with density functional theory. Using this NNP, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the magnetite (001) surface across a wide range of water coverages, from the single molecule to bulk water. Our simulations revealed several new ground states of low coverage water on the Subsurface Cation Vacancy (SCV) model and yielded a density profile of water at the surface that exhibits marked layering. By calculating mean square displacements, we obtained quantitative information on the diffusion of water molecules on the SCV for different coverages, revealing significant anisotropy. Additionally, our simulations provided qualitative insights into the dissociation mechanisms of water molecules at the surface.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics and elasto-chemical cluster waves in communicating colloids with explicit size response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical communication, response, and feedback are key requirements for the function of adaptive materials with life-like properties. However, how communication on the single cell-level impacts the collective structural, dynamical and mechanical behavior of active soft matter is not well understood. Here, we report how communication controls the spatiotemporal structure and phase behavior of active, hydrogel-based colloidal liquids using Brownian particle-based simulations with explicit resolution of the chemical signaling waves as well as the individual particle's elastic response to communication and crowding. We find a rich topology of nonequilibrium active phases, vastly tuneable by the signaling magnitude, in particular, active melting, synchronization transitions from uncorrelated to antiphase oscillatory liquids, or to in-phase oscillations with accompanying elasto-chemical cluster waves. Our work employs minimal physical principles required for communication-mediated dynamics of microscopic, fluctuating systems, thus uncovering universal aspects in signaling soft systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of confinement induced effects on atomic electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that although a litany of studies have been published on atoms in hard-wall confinement, they have either not been systematic, having only looked at select atoms and/or select electronic configurations, or they have not used robust numerical methods. To remedy the situation, we perform in this work a methodical study of atoms in hard-wall confinement with the HelFEM program, which employs the finite element method (FEM) that trivially implements the hard-wall potential, guarantees variational results, and allows easily finding the numerically exact solution.
  We systematically examine low lying configurations of the H-Xe atoms and their monocations, and investigate how the states - especially the ground state - behave as a function of the position of the hard-wall boundary. Our fully numerical calculations are based on non-relativistic density functional theory (DFT), employing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional and spherically averaged densities. We consider calculations with both spin-polarized as well as spin-restricted densities, and demonstrate that spin-polarization effects are significant in open shell configurations, even though some previous studies have only considered the spin-restricted model.
  We demonstrate the importance of considering ground state changes for confined atoms by computing the ionization radii for the H-Xe atoms and observe significant differences to earlier studies. Confirming previous observations, we identify electron shifts on the outermost shells for a majority of the elements: valence $s$ electrons are highly unfavored under strong confinement, and the high-lying $3d$ and $4f$ orbitals become occupied in atoms of periods 2-3 and 4, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler optical-optical double-resonance spectroscopy using a cavity-enhanced frequency comb probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate parameters of molecular hot-band transitions, i.e., those starting from vibrationally excited levels, are needed to accurately model high-temperature spectra in astrophysics and combustion, yet laboratory spectra measured at high temperatures are often unresolved and difficult to assign. Optical-optical double-resonance (OODR) spectroscopy allows the measurement and assignment of individual hot-band transitions from selectively pumped energy levels without the need to heat the sample. However, previous demonstrations lacked either sufficient resolution, spectral coverage, absorption sensitivity, or frequency accuracy. Here we demonstrate OODR spectroscopy using a cavity-enhanced frequency comb probe that combines all these advantages. We detect and assign sub-Doppler transitions in the spectral range of the 3${\nu}$${_3}$${\leftarrow}$${\nu}$${_3}$ resonance of methane with frequency precision and sensitivity more than an order of magnitude better than before. This technique will provide high-accuracy data about excited states of a wide range of molecules that is urgently needed for theoretical modeling of high-temperature data and cannot be obtained using other methods.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein Relations between Absorption and Emission Spectra at Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Einstein coefficient spectra and a detailed-balance derivation of generalized Einstein relations between them that is based on the connection between spontaneous and stimulated emission. If two broadened levels or bands overlap in energy, transitions between them need not be purely absorptive or emissive. Consequently, spontaneous emission can occur in both transition directions, and four Einstein coefficient spectra replace the three Einstein coefficients for a line. At equilibrium, the four different spectra obey five pairwise relationships and one lineshape generates all four. These relationships are independent of molecular quantum statistics and predict the Stokes' shift between forward and reverse transitions required by equilibrium with blackbody radiation. For Boltzmann statistics, the relative strengths of forward and reverse transitions depend on the formal chemical potential difference between the initial and final bands, which becomes the standard chemical potential difference for ideal solutes. The formal chemical potential of a band replaces both the energy and degeneracy of a quantum level. Like the energies of quantum levels, the formal chemical potentials of bands obey the Rydberg-Ritz combination principle. Each stimulated Einstein coefficient spectrum gives a frequency-dependent transition cross section. Transition cross sections obey causality and a detailed-balance condition with spontaneous emission, but do not directly obey generalized Einstein relations. Even with an energetic width much less than the photon energy, an absorptive forward transition with an energetic width much greater than the thermal energy can have such an extreme Stokes' shift that its reverse transition cross section becomes predominantly absorptive rather than emissive.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Typical: Modeling Rare Plausible Patterns in Chemical Reactions by Leveraging Sequential Mixture-of-Experts</title>

Abstract: Reaction prediction, a critical task in synthetic chemistry, is to predict the outcome of a reaction based on given reactants. Generative models like Transformer and VAE have typically been employed to predict the reaction product. However, these likelihood-maximization models overlooked the inherent stochastic nature of chemical reactions, such as the multiple ways electrons can be redistributed among atoms during the reaction process. In scenarios where similar reactants could follow different electron redistribution patterns, these models typically predict the most common outcomes, neglecting less frequent but potentially crucial reaction patterns. These overlooked patterns, though rare, can lead to innovative methods for designing synthetic routes and significantly advance synthesis techniques. To break the limits of previous approaches, we propose organizing the mapping space between reactants and electron redistribution patterns in a divide-and-conquer manner. We address the reaction problem by training multiple expert models, each specializing in capturing a type of electron redistribution pattern in reaction. These experts enhance the prediction process by considering both typical and other less common electron redistribution manners. In the inference stage, a dropout strategy is applied to each expert to improve the electron redistribution diversity. The most plausible products are finally predicted through a ranking stage designed to integrate the predictions from multiple experts. Experimental results on the largest reaction prediction benchmark USPTO-MIT show the superior performance of our proposed method compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widely used thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is generalized to include the effect of electron correlation while maintaining its quasi-independent-particle framework. An electron-correlated internal energy (or grand potential) is postulated in consultation with the second-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates the corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that all fundamental thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density matrix is of a one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The formulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of Fermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus constitutes a finite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of one-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a second-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation. At low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same order, but it may outperform the latter at intermediate temperature by including additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A physical meaning of these thermal orbital energies is proposed (encompassing that of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) as a finite-temperature version of Janak's theorem.</description>
