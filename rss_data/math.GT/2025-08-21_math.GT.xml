      <title>Knot quandles distinguish Suciu's ribbon knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knot quandle is an invariant of $n$-knots. In this note, we study the knot quandles of Suciu's ribbon $n$-knots, an infinite family of knots with isomorphic knot groups. We prove that their knot quandles are mutually non-isomorphic. Furthermore, we compute types of these quandles.</description>

      <title>On the quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ invariant of positive links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the skein theory of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-webs to study the properties of the quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_3$-link polynomial of positive links. We give explicit formulae for the three leading terms of the polynomial on positive links in terms of diagrammatic quantities of their positive diagrams. We show that a positive link is fibered if and only the second coefficient of the polynomial is equal to one. We also show that the third coefficient provides obstructions to representing links by positive braids.</description>

      <title>A large color $R$-matrix for $\mathfrak{sl}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the invariant $F_K^{\mathfrak{sl}_3}\in\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}][[x,y]]$ for any positive braid knot $K$, whose existence was conjectured by Park, building on earlier work of Gukov--Manolescu. The main step in our work extends a result by the first author on the invariant associated to symmetric representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ to all irreducible representations. We conclude with a conjectural framework for constructing $F_K^{\mathfrak{sl}_N}$ for arbitrary $N$.</description>

      <title>Projective rigidity of circle patterns and polyhedral surfaces in hyperbolic ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a closed, orientable surface of genus $g\geq 2$. We consider Delaunay circle patterns on $S$ equipped with a complex projective structure. We prove that the space of complex projective structures on $S$ equipped with a Delaunay circle pattern of prescribed combinatorics and intersection angles is a manifold of dimension $6g-6$, and that the forgetful map to the space $\cC_S$ of $\CP^1$-structures on $S$ is a Lagrangian immersion. This extends a recent result of Bonsante and Wolf for circle packings.
  This statement, and its proof, are more conveniently stated in terms of ideal polyhedral surfaces (surfaces with vertices at infinity) in hyperbolic ends, with the angles between the circles corresponding to the dihedral angles. Seen from this angle, we extend the statement to ideal polyhedral surfaces with prescribed edge lengths (or induced metrics), and to other types of polyhedral surfaces, either compact or hyperideal.</description>

      <title>On homology spheres of the trivial local equivalence class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the homology cobordism group $\Theta_{\mathbb{Z}}^3$, it is not known if there is a non-trivial linear dependence between Seifert fibered spheres. Based on involutive Heegaard Floer theory, Hendricks, Manolescu, and Zemke introduced the local equivalence group $\mathfrak{I}$ with the homomorphism $h:\Theta_{\mathbb{Z}}^3 \rightarrow \mathfrak{I}$. And it is possible to find a non-trivial linear dependence between the image of Seifert fibered spheres in $\mathfrak{I}$ using the work of Dai and Stoffregen. Therefore, it is interesting to ask if such a linear dependence in $\mathfrak{I}$ originates from $\Theta_{\mathbb{Z}}^3$. In this paper, we prove that this is not the case in general. We show that infinitely many homology spheres linearly dependent in $\mathfrak{I}$ are linearly independent even in the rational homology cobordism group $\Theta_{\mathbb{Q}}^3$, by employing the $r_s$-invariants from the filtered instanton Floer homology developed by Nozaki, Sato, and Taniguchi. Moreover, these homology spheres include homology spheres of the trivial local equivalence class of $\operatorname{Pin(2)}$-equivariant Seiberg--Witten Floer stable homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Non-negative curvature on certain product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G/H$ be a closed, simply connected homogeneous manifold. Suppose every stable class of real vector bundles over $G/H$ contains a homogeneous bundle. Then, for any closed, simply connected smooth manifold $M$ homotopy equivalent to $G/H$, there exists $n&gt;\mathrm{dim}(M)$ such that the product manifold $M\times S^{n}$ admits a metric with non-negative sectional curvature. Many homogeneous manifolds satisfy this assumption, including simply connected compact rank-one symmetric spaces, and among others.</description>

      <title>Milnor fibrations and oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a combinatorial model for the Milnor fibration of a complexified real arrangement using oriented matroids. It is a poset quasi-fibration, a notion recently introduced by the first author, whose domain is a subdivision of the Salvetti complex stemming from a natural subdivision of the dual oriented matroid complex. This yields a concrete finite regular CW complex which is homotopy equivalent to the Milnor fiber of the complexified real arrangement and implies that the homotopy type of the Milnor fiber of a complexified real arrangement only depends on the underlying combinatorial structure given by its oriented matroid. Moreover, our construction works for any oriented matroid, disregarding realizability, so we obtain a notion of a combinatorial Milnor fibration for any oriented matroid.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and orbit counting of Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>

      <title>Estimating Reeb chords using microlocal sheaf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.04079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for a closed Legendrian submanifold in a 1-jet bundle, if there is a sheaf with compact support, perfect stalk and singular support on that Legendrian, then (1) the number of Reeb chords has a lower bound by half of the sum of Betti numbers of the Legendrian; (2) the number of Reeb chords between the original Legendrian and its Hamiltonian pushoff has a lower bound in terms of Betti numbers when the oscillation norm of the Hamiltonian is small comparing with the length of Reeb chords. In the proof we develop a duality exact triangle and use the persistence structure (which comes from the action filtration) of microlocal sheaves.</description>

      <title>Geometry of extensions of free groups via automorphisms with fixed points on the complex of free factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give conditions of an extension of a free group to be hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic using the dynamics of the action of $\out$ on the complex of free factors combined with the weak attraction theory. We work with subgroups of exponentially growing outer automorphisms and instead of using a standard pingpong argument with loxodromics, we allow fixed points for the action and investigate the geometry of the extension group when the fixed points of the automorphisms on the complex of free factors are sufficiently far apart.</description>
