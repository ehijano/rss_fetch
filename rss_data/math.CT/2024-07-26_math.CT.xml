      <title>Exponentiable functors between synthetic $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exponentiable functors in the context of synthetic $\infty$-categories. We do this within the framework of simplicial Homotopy Type Theory of Riehl and Shulman. Our main result characterizes exponentiable functors. In order to achieve this, we explore Segal type completions. Moreover, we verify that our result is semantically sound.</description>

      <title>IsUMap: Manifold Learning and Data Visualization leveraging Vietoris-Rips filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces IsUMap, a novel manifold learning technique that enhances data representation by integrating aspects of UMAP and Isomap with Vietoris-Rips filtrations. We present a systematic and detailed construction of a metric representation for locally distorted metric spaces that captures complex data structures more accurately than the previous schemes. Our approach addresses limitations in existing methods by accommodating non-uniform data distributions and intricate local geometries. We validate its performance through extensive experiments on examples of various geometric objects and benchmark real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in representation quality.</description>

      <title>Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras and Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Li, Sheng and Tang introduced post-Hopf algebras and relative Rota-Baxter operators (on cocommutative Hopf algebras), providing an adjunction between the respective categories under the assumption that the structures involved are cocommutative. We introduce Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras, which become usual post-Hopf algebras in the cocommutative setting. In analogy with the correspondence between cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and cocommutative Hopf braces, the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is isomorphic to the category of Yetter-Drinfeld braces introduced by the author in a joint work with D. Ferri. This allows to explore the connection with matched pairs of actions and provide examples of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras. Moreover, we prove that the category of Yetter-Drinfeld post-Hopf algebras is equivalent to a subcategory of Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators. The latter structures coincide with the inverse maps of Yetter-Drinfeld 1-cocycles introduced by the author and D. Ferri, and generalise bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators on cocommutative Hopf algebras. Hence the previous equivalence passes to cocommutative post-Hopf algebras and bijective relative Rota-Baxter operators. Once the surjectivity of the Yetter-Drinfeld relative Rota-Baxter operators is removed, the equivalence is replaced by an adjunction and one can recover the result of Li, Sheng and Tang in the cocommutative case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the homotopical analysis of enveloping operads in a general cofibrantly generated symmetric monoidal model category. We show the potential of this analysis by obtaining, in a uniform way, several central results regarding the homotopy theory of operadic algebras.</description>

      <title>String diagrams for Strictification and Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas string diagrams for strict monoidal categories are well understood, and have found application in several fields of Computer Science, graphical formalisms for non-strict monoidal categories are far less studied. In this paper, we provide a presentation by generators and relations of string diagrams for non-strict monoidal categories, and show how this construction can handle applications in domains such as digital circuits and programming languages. We prove the correctness of our construction, which yields a novel proof of Mac Lane's strictness theorem. This in turn leads to an elementary graphical proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem, and in particular allows for the inductive construction of the canonical isomorphisms in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Relative ideals in homological categories, with an application to MV-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a homological category and $U\colon B\to A$ be a faithful conservative right adjoint. We introduce the notion of relative ideal with respect to $U$, and we show that, under suitable conditions, any object of $A$ can be seen as a relative ideal of some object in $B$. We then develop a case study. We first prove that the category of hoops is semi-abelian and that the category of MV-algebras is protomodular, then we apply our results to the forgetful functor from the category of MV-algebras to the category of Wajsberg hoops.</description>

      <title>Categories of hypermagmas, hypergroups, and related hyperstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to diagnose the cause of some defects in the category of canonical hypergroups, we investigate several categories of hyperstructures that generalize hypergroups. By allowing hyperoperations with possibly empty products, one obtains categories with desirable features such as completeness and cocompleteness, free functors, regularity, and closed monoidal structures. We show by counterexamples that such constructions cannot be carried out within the category of canonical hypergroups. This suggests that (commutative) unital, reversible hypermagmas -- which we call mosaics -- form a worthwhile generalization of (canonical) hypergroups from the categorical perspective. Notably, mosaics contain pointed simple matroids as a subcategory, and projective geometries as a full subcategory.</description>

      <title>Bounded $t$-structures, finitistic dimensions, and singularity categories of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Amnon Neeman settled a bold conjecture by Antieau, Gepner, and Heller regarding the relationship between the regularity of finite-dimensional noetherian schemes and the existence of bounded $t$-structures on their derived categories of perfect complexes.
  In this paper, using different methods, we prove some very general results about the existence of bounded $t$-structures on (not necessarily algebraic or topological) triangulated categories and their invariance under completion. We show that if the opposite category of an essentially small triangulated category has finite finitistic dimension in our sense, then the existence of a bounded t-structure on it forces it to be equal to its completion. We also prove a parallel result regarding the equivalence of all bounded t-structures on any intermediate triangulated category between the starting category and its completion.
  Our general treatment, when specialized to the case of schemes, immediately gives us Neeman's theorem as an application and significantly generalizes another remarkable theorem by Neeman about the equivalence of bounded $t$-structures on the bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves. When specialized to other cases like associative rings, nonpositive DG-rings, connective $\mathbb{E}_1$-rings, triangulated categories without models, etc., we get many other applications. Under mild finiteness assumptions, these results not only give a categorical obstruction (the singularity category in our sense) to the existence of bounded $t$-structures on a triangulated category, but also provide plenty of triangulated categories on which all bounded $t$-structures are equivalent. The strategy used in our treatment is introducing a new concept of finitistic dimension for triangulated categories and lifting $t$-structures along completions of triangulated categories.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series and the length of triangulated categories, and we study compositions series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. For example, we compute the length of the derived category ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ and classify all finite length thick subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$. Furthermore, we prove that the derived categories of certain smooth projective varieties have composition series of different lengths. We also discuss the length of (1) derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, (2) derived categories of some singular varieties and (3) Krah's phantom subcategories.</description>
