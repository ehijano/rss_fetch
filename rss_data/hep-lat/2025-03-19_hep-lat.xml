      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>Lattice Monte Carlo meets lattice functional Renormalization Group: A quantitative comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the functional Renormalization Group (RG) are powerful approaches that allow for quantitative studies of non-perturbative phenomena such as bound-state formation, spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions. While results from both methods have recently shown remarkable agreement for many observables, e.g., in Quantum Chromodynamics, an analysis of deviations in certain quantities turns out to be challenging. This is because calculations with the two methods are based on different approximations, regularizations and scale fixing procedures. In the present work, we present a framework for a more direct comparison by formulating the functional RG approach on a finite spacetime lattice. This removes all ambiguities of regularization, finite size and scale fixing procedures in concrete studies. By investigating the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions in a $Z(2)$ scalar theory in $d=1,2,3$ spacetime dimensions, we demonstrate at the example of the local potential approximation how this framework can be used to evaluate and compare the systematic errors of both approaches.</description>

      <title>Charmoniumlike Channels $1^{+}$ with Isospin $1$ from Lattice and Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many exotic charmoniumlike mesons have already been discovered experimentally, of which the $Z_c$ mesons with $I=1$ are prominent examples. We investigate $J^{PC}=1^{+\pm}$ states with flavor $\bar cc\bar qq$ ($q=u,d$) in $I=1$ using lattice QCD. This is the first study of these mesons employing more than one volume and involving frames with nonzero total momentum. We utilize two $N_f=2+1$ CLS ensembles with $m_{\pi}\simeq 280\,$MeV. The simulations are performed with unphysical light quark masses at a single lattice spacing of $a\simeq 0.086\,$fm and omit $\psi(2S)\pi$, $\psi(3770)\pi$ and three-particle decay channels, so our results provide only qualitative insights. Resulting eigenenergies are compatible or just slightly shifted down with respect to noninteracting energies, where the most significant shifts occur for certain $D\bar D^*$ states. Both channels $1^{+\pm}$ have a virtual pole slightly below the threshold if $D\bar D^*$ is assumed to be decoupled from other channels. In addition, we perform a coupled channel analysis of $J/\psi\pi$ and $D\bar D^*$ scattering with $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ within an effective field theory framework. The $J/\psi\pi$ and $D\bar D^*$ line shapes from BESIII and finite-volume energies from several lattice QCD simulations, including this work, are fitted simultaneously. All fits yield two poles relatively close to the $D\bar D^*$ threshold and reasonably reproduce the experimental $Z_c$ peaks. They also reproduce lattice energies up to slightly above the $D\bar D^*$ threshold, while reproduction at even higher energies is better for fits that put more weight on the lattice data. Our findings suggest that the employed EFT can reasonably reconcile the peaks in the experimental line shapes and the lattice energies, although those lie close to noninteracting energies. We also study $J/\psi\pi$ scattering in s wave and place upper bounds on the phase shift.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Heteropolymers from Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice models are valuable tools to gain insight into the statistical physics of heteropolymers. We rigorously map the partition function of these models into a vacuum expectation value of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT), with both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. Because the associated path integral expression is not affected by a sign problem, it is amenable to Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in both the sequence and structure space, unlike conventional polymer field theory. At the same time, since the LGT encoding relies on qubits, it provides a framework for future efforts to capitalize on the development of quantum computing hardware. We discuss two illustrative applications of our formalism: first, we use it to characterize the thermodynamically stable sequences and structures of small heteropolymers consisting of two types of residues. Next, we assess its efficiency to sample ensembles of compact structures, finding that the MC decorrelation time scales only linearly with the chain length.</description>

      <title>Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</description>
