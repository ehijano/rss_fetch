      <title>Anonymous Pricing in Large Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study revenue maximization when a seller offers $k$ identical units to ex ante heterogeneous, unit-demand buyers. While anonymous pricing can be $\Theta(\log k)$ worse than optimal in general multi-unit environments, we show that this pessimism disappears in large markets, where no single buyer accounts for a non-negligible share of optimal revenue. Under (quasi-)regularity, anonymous pricing achieves a $2+O(1/\sqrt{k})$ approximation to the optimal mechanism; the worst-case ratio is maximized at about $2.47$ when $k=1$ and converges to $2$ as $k$ grows. This indicates that the gains from third-degree price discrimination are mild in large markets.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Instability in Strategy-Proof Matching Mechanism Using A Linear Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of one-to-one matching mechanisms that are strategy-proof for both sides and as stable as possible. Motivated by the impossibility result of Roth (1982), we formulate the mechanism design problem as a linear program that minimizes stability violations subject to exact strategy-proofness constraints. We consider both an average-case objective (summing violations over all preference profiles) and a worst-case objective (minimizing the maximum violation across profiles), and we show that imposing anonymity and symmetry when the number of agents in both sides are the same can be done without loss of optimality. Computationally, for small markets our approach yields randomized mechanisms with substantially lower stability violations than randomized sequential dictatorship (RSD); in the $3\times 3$ case the optimum reduces average instability to roughly one third of RSD. For deterministic mechanisms with three students and three schools, we find that any two-sided strategy-proof mechanism has at least two blocking pairs in the worst case and we provide a simple algorithm that attains this bound. Finally, we propose an extension to larger markets and present simulation evidence that, relative to sequential dictatorship (SD), it reduces the number of blocking pairs by about $0.25$ on average.</description>

      <title>Failures of Contingent Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a behavioral definition of an agent's perceived implication that uniquely identifies a subjective state-space representing her view of a decision problem, and which may differ from the modeler's. By examining belief updating within this model, we formalize the recent empirical consensus that reducing uncertainty improves contingent thinking, and propose a novel form of updating corresponding to the agent 'realizing' a flaw in her own thinking. Finally, we clarify the sense in which contingent thinking makes state-bystate dominance more cognitively demanding than obvious dominance.</description>
