      <title>Charged Binaries in Gravitational Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation low-frequency interferometers are expected to detect binary systems near supermassive black holes, where tidal effects can alter significantly the motion of the binary. This motivates a broader investigation of how external gravitational fields influence the dynamics of physical systems. In this work, we consider a charged black hole binary system subject to a gravitational tide. We first construct a stationary gravitational tide acting on a dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and, focusing on the extreme mass-ratio limit, we analyze the motion of a test particle. By calculating the secular Hamiltonian of the test particle, we obtain the ISCO and light ring tidal shifts in terms of explicit functions of the parameters of the binary. Our results show that tidal corrections are suppressed as the charge of the black hole increases, but they persist in the extremal limit yielding a finite contribution. This work paves the way towards studying tidal effects on other charged systems, such as topological stars.</description>

      <title>(2+1) Lorentzian quantum cosmology from spin-foams: chances and obstacles for semi-classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08109v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an effective cosmological spin-foam model for a (2+1) dimensional spatially flat universe, discretized on a hypercubical lattice, containing both space- and time-like regions. Our starting point is the recently proposed coherent state spin-foam model for (2+1) Lorentzian quantum gravity. The full amplitude is assumed to factorize into single vertex amplitudes with boundary data corresponding to Lorentzian 3-frusta. A stationary phase approximation is performed at each vertex individually, where the inverse square root of the Hessian determinant serves as a measure for the effective path integral. Additionally, a massive scalar field is coupled to the geometry, and we show that its mass renders the partition function convergent. For a single 3-frustum with time-like struts, we compute the expectation value of the bulk strut length and show that it generically agrees with the classical solutions and that it is a discontinuous function of the scalar field mass. Allowing the struts to be space-like introduces causality violations, which drive the expectation values away from the classical solutions due to the lack of an exponential suppression of these configurations. This is a direct consequence of the semi-classical amplitude only containing the real part of deficit angles, in contrast with the Lorentzian Regge action used in effective spin-foams. We give an outlook on how to evaluate the partition function on an extended discretization including a bulk spatial slice. This serves as a foundation for future investigations of physically interesting scenarios such as a quantum bounce or the viability of massive scalar field clocks. Our results demonstrate that the effective path integral in the causally regular sector serves as a viable quantum cosmology model, but that the agreement of expectation values with classical solutions is tightly bound to the path integral measure.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, evaporation of a black hole immersed in a de Sitter environment is considered. Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime is used to model the process in a scenario of accelerated expansion of the Universe. The role of observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs). It is found how the timescale of evaporation depends on the choice of a cosmological observer. It may differ substantially from the treatment based on stationary models for black holes. In particular, the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today is imprecise, even when possible quantum corrections at the late stages are not considered. Deviations from this prediction appear when the evaporation is measured with respect to the cosmological time.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of protoneutron stars from gravitational wave signals using the Hilbert-Huang transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are potential multimessenger events detectable by current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The GW signals emitted during these events are expected to provide insights into the explosion mechanism and the internal structures of neutron stars. In recent years, several studies have empirically derived the relationship between the frequencies of the GW signals originating from the oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) and the physical parameters of these stars. This study applies the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) [Proc. R. Soc. A 454, 903 (1998)] to extract the frequencies of these modes to infer the physical properties of the PNSs. The results exhibit comparable accuracy to a short-time Fourier transform-based estimation, highlighting the potential of this approach as a complementary method for extracting physical information from GW signals of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Determining parameters of Kerr-Newman black holes by shadow observation from finite distance and spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for determining the physical parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole through shadow observation. In a system comprising a Kerr-Newman black hole, an observer, and a light source, the relevant parameters are mass $M$, specific angular momentum $a$, electric charge $Q$, inclination angle $i$, and distance $r_o$. We consider the cases where the observer is at either a finite distance or spatial infinity. Using our method, the dimensionless parameters $(a/M, Q/M, i)$ can be determined by observing the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole from spatial infinity. We analytically prove that the shadow contour of the Kerr-Newman black hole observed from spatial infinity is unique, where uniqueness is defined as the absence of two congruent shadow contours for distinct sets of dimensionless parameter values. This method is versatile and can be applied to a range of black hole solutions with charge. Additionally, we show analytically that the shadow contour of a Kerr-Newman black hole observed from a finite distance $r_o$ is not unique, meaning that the parameters of a Kerr-Newman black hole at finite distance cannot be determined from shadow observations. This result reveals a new challenge and provides a clear direction for further research on black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Blandford-Znajek power as a strong-gravity signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek mechanism is an electromagnetic manifestation of the Penrose process that currently constitutes the best theoretical candidate to explain the launching of relativistic jets by black holes. In this talk we offer a modern review about the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and the analytic construction of black hole magnetospheres. Higher order perturbative corrections are crucial in order to produce results that are complementary to numerical simulations when the black hole is in the high-spin regime, and can potentially predict new features about the non-perturbative structure of the Blandford-Znajek theory. Moreover, we show by means of an explicit example that these perturbative corrections depend in a non-degenerate manner on the underlying theory of gravity considered, enabling one to use the BZ power emitted as a strong-gravity signature to test General Relativity against alternative theories of gravity on future horizon-scale observations.</description>

      <title>Shadow analysis of an approximate rotating black hole solution with weakly coupled global monopole charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties of a rotating black hole with a weakly coupled global monopole charge, using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm. This study explores how this charge and rotational effects shape the black hole's shadow, causal structure, and ergoregions, with implications for distinguishing it from Kerr-like solutions. Analysis of null geodesics reveals observable features that may constrain the global monopole charge and weak coupling parameters within nonminimal gravity frameworks. Observational data from M87* and Sgr A* constrain the global monopole charge and coupling constant to $0 \leq \gamma \lesssim 0.036$ and $-0.2 \lesssim \alpha \leq 0$, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Lense-Thirring effect at work in M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08686v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the temporal evolution of the angles characterizing the spatial configuration of the jet in the supermassive black hole M87$^\ast$ was measured exhibiting a precessional pattern around the hole's spin axis. It would be due to the dragging induced by the fact that the hole's external spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. Here, it is shown that the Lense-Thirring orbital precessions of a test particle moving about a rotating massive object, calculated perturbatively to the first post-Newtonian order, are able to fully reproduce all the measured features of the jet axis of M87$^\ast$. In particular, by assuming that the latter is aligned with the angular momentum of the accretion disk, modelled as an effective particle moving along a circular orbit, the condition that the absolute value of the predicted Lense-Thirring precessional frequency of the disk agrees with the measured value of $0.56\pm 0.02$ radians per year of the jet's one is satisfied for a range of physically meaningful values of the hole's spin parameter, close to unity, and of the effective disk radius, of the order of just over a dozen gravitational radii. Relying upon such assumptions and results, it is possible to predict that the angle between the hole's spin axis and the jet's one stays constant over the years amounting to $1.16^\circ$, in agreement with its measured value of $1.25^\circ\pm 0.18^\circ$. Furthermore, also the temporal pattern and the amplitudes of the time series of the jet's angles are reproduced by the aforementioned Lense-Thirring precessional model.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.</description>

      <title>Dark energy effects on realistic neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering realistic equations of state (EoSs) to describe the ordinary matter of the stellar crust, in this study, we explore the effect of a dark energy core, made of Chaplygin Dark Fluid (CDF), on neutron stars (NSs). To accomplish this purpose, we solve the stellar structure equations and investigate the impact of the CDF parameters on the several macroscopic properties of NSs such as mass-radius ($M-R$) relation, and tidal deformabilities of a single star and of a binary system, the latter being of great importance when analyzing gravitational-wave signals coming from the merger of such compact objects. We also present an analysis of the radial oscillation modes for the rapid phase transition, with the aim of distinguishing regions consisting of dynamically stable stars from those of unstable ones. Specifically, our outcomes reveal that an increase in the energy density jump (controlled by a parameter $\alpha$) leads to an increase in the radial stability of the NS with a CDF core. Furthermore, our theoretical results are consistent with the observational $M-R$ measurements of millisecond pulsars from NICER data and tidal deformability constraints from the GW170817 event.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Vectors as sensitive tools for blind tests of CMB anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological data collected on a sphere, such as CMB anisotropies, are typically represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients, denoted as $a_{\ell m}$. The angular power spectrum, or $C_\ell$, serves as the fundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical data and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs) and the Fr\'echet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as Fr\'echet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact space, making them highly sensitive to small displacements of these points. This sensitivity makes FVs excellent indicators of statistical correlations between different multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data. Through simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and reconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly introduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying this to the 2018 Planck maps, we implement several improvements on previous model-independent tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. When compared with simulated maps that incorporate masking and anisotropic noise, for $2 \leq\ell \leq 1500$, while Planck's MVs appear consistent with these hypotheses, the corresponding FVs reject them with significances between 5.2 and $8.3\sigma$, depending on the component separation method.</description>

      <title>Chaos and the Emergence of the Cosmological Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct algebras of diff-invariant observables in a global de Sitter universe with two observers and a free scalar QFT in two dimensions. We work in the strict $G_N \rightarrow 0$ limit, but allow the observers to have an order one mass in cosmic units. The observers are fully quantized. In the limit when the observers have infinite mass and are localized along geodesics at the North and South poles, it was shown in previous work \cite{CLPW} that their algebras are mutually commuting type II$_1$ factors. Away from this limit, we show that the algebras fail to commute and that they are type I non-factors. Physically, this is because the observers' trajectories are uncertain and state-dependent, and they may come into causal contact. We compute out-of-time-ordered correlators along an observer's worldline, and observe a Lyapunov exponent given by $\frac{4 \pi}{\beta_{\text{dS}}}$, as a result of observer recoil and de Sitter expansion. This should be contrasted with results from AdS gravity, and exceeds the chaos bound associated with the de Sitter temperature by a factor of two. We also discuss how the cosmological horizon emerges in the large mass limit and comment on implications for de Sitter holography.</description>

      <title>Spinning bodies in general relativity from bosonic worldline oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Worldline quantum field theory (WQFT) has proven itself a powerful tool for classical two-body scattering calculations in general relativity. In this paper we develop a new worldline action involving bosonic oscillators, which enables the use of the WQFT formalism to describe massive compact bodies to all orders in their spins. Inspired by bosonic string theory in the tensionless limit, we augment traditional trajectory variables with bosonic oscillators capturing the spin dependence. We show its equivalence to the covariant phase space description of a spinning body in curved space and clarify the role of the spin-supplementary condition in a Hamiltonian treatment. Higher-spin Hamiltonians are classified to linear and quadratic order in curvature. Finally, perturbative computations at 1PM order for arbitrary powers and orientations of spin and at 2PM up to quartic spin order are performed, recovering results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity with 3d Velocity Reconstruction from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic velocity field is an unbiased probe of the total matter distribution but is challenging to measure directly at intermediate and high redshifts. The large-scale velocity field imprints a signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. We perform the first 3d reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field from the kSZ effect by applying a quadratic estimator to CMB temperature maps and the 3d positions of galaxies. We do so by combining CMB data from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (in combination with Planck) and a spectroscopic galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We then measure the galaxy-velocity cross-power spectrum and detect the presence of the kSZ signal at a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.2$\sigma$. Using this galaxy-velocity cross-correlation alone, we constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity finding $f_{\rm NL}=-90^{+210}_{-350}$. This pathfinder measurement sets the stage for joint galaxy-CMB kSZ constraints to significantly enhance the $f_{\rm NL}$ information obtained from galaxy surveys through sample variance cancellation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the supersymmetric index of half BPS black holes in N=2 supergravity with higher curvature corrections and show that the result agrees with the degeneracy of supersymmetric extremal black holes carrying the same charges.

      <description>arXiv:2411.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a wider theoretical framework that has quantum field theory built-in, taking the fact that quantum mechanics is reconstructed from quantum field theory as a hint. We formulate a quantum theory with an embedded structure by introducing functional operators, and we find that it could describe the level II multiverse. Topics related to a beginning of the universe such as inflation, the third quantization and the landscape are discussed in our formulation.</description>

      <title>Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evaluation of hadron-quark phase transition models through neutron star observables in light of nuclear and astrophysics data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of hybrid and nucleonic equations of state (EOSs) within neutron star (NS) interiors using Bayesian inference to evaluate their alignment with recent observational data from NICER and LIGO-Virgo (LV) collaborations. We find that smooth hybrid EOSs are slightly favoured in explaining NS mass-radius relations, particularly for pulsars such as PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. However, this preference is not definitive, as gravitational wave (GW) data does not significantly differentiate between our hybrid and nucleonic models. Our analysis also reveals tensions between older NICER data and recent measurements for PSR J0437-4715, highlighting the need for more flexible EOS models. Through two sampling approaches - one fixing the hadronic EOS set and the other without fixing the same, we demonstrate that the hybrid EOS model can incorporate stiffer EOSs, resulting in a better agreement with NICER data but leading to higher tidal deformability, which is less consistent with GW observations. In some recent publications a parameter $d_c$, related to the trace anomaly and its derivative, is used to indicate the presence of deconfined quark matter. We find that our hadronic model, which does not include phase transition to deconfined matter, under the influence of imposed constraints, is able to predict values below 0.2 for $d_c$ at around five times saturation density. The hybrid model goes below this threshold at lower densities under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale in modular invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately $10^{15}\, \mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds, showing that this reformulation allows us to directly constrain the fundamental parameters related to the geometry of extra dimensions, specifically the second Chern numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08540v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the flat limit of AdS/CFT from the point of view of geodesics in AdS. We show that the flat space scattering amplitudes can be constructed from operator insertions where the geodesics of the particles corresponding to the operators hit the conformal boundary of AdS. Further, we compute the Li\'enard-Wiechert solutions in AdS by boosting a static charge using AdS isometries and show that the solutions are antipodally matched between two regions, separated by a global time difference of $\Delta\tau=\pi$. Going to the boundary of AdS along null geodesics, in the flat limit, this antipodal matching leads to the flat space antipodal matching near spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Globally Stable Dark Energy in F(R) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</description>

      <title>The special case of slow-roll attractors in de Sitter: Non-Markovian noise and evolution of entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the evolution of the reduced density matrix of inflationary perturbations, coupled to a heavy entropic field via the leading-order term within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation, for two nearly de Sitter backgrounds. We perform a full quantum treatment of the open system and derive a Fokker-Planck equation to describe decoherence and the entanglement structure of the adiabatic perturbations. We find that exotic phenomena, such as recoherence and transient negative growth of entanglement entropy, appearing for the attractor solution, are absent for the non-attractor background. We comment on the relationship of these to the non-Markovian nature of the system. Finally, we generalise to the case where a few e-folds of ultra-slow roll evolution are sandwiched between phases of slow-roll inflation to find its (memory) effects on the curvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c &gt; 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c &lt; 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic chemical enrichment with next-generation gravitational-wave observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By observing binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to the edge of the Universe, next-generation (XG) ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope will map the BBH merger rate across all of cosmic history. This merger rate traces the formation rate of their progenitor stars convolved with a delay time distribution. Given theoretically-motivated priors on the delay time distribution, we show how XG observations can measure the BBH progenitor formation rate, probing the star formation rate (SFR) up to $z &gt; 15$. However, the progenitor formation rate does not directly give a measurement of the SFR, but rather a combination of the SFR and its metallicity distribution as a function of redshift. Fortunately, the metallicity-dependence of BBH formation likely varies as a function of BBH mass and/or formation channel. We find that if different BBH subpopulations with distinct metallicity biases can be identified, comparing their rates as a function of redshift yields a simultaneous measurement of the SFR and its metallicity distribution. Given optimistic theoretical priors and one year of observation, this may provide a $\sim10\%$ measurement of the SFR at its peak and a 0.2 dex (0.7 dex) measurement of the median metallicity out to $z = 10$ ($z = 15$) at 90\% credibility, although the uncertainties scale with theoretical uncertainties on BBH delay times and formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Chiral Gravitational Wave Background from Audible Axion via Nieh-Yan Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be probed through gravitational waves indirectly, often referred to as "audible axions". The usual concept of audible axion relies on the coupling between the axions and the gauge fields. Here we consider an axion-like mechanism with coupling to the Nieh-Yan term. This interaction leads to the direct and efficient production of gravitational waves during the radiation-dominated era, originating from the tachyonic instability of the gravitational perturbations with the Nieh-Yan term. We calculate the energy spectral density of the chiral gravitational wave background and the comoving energy density of axion-like fields. Based on the numerical results, we explore the parameter space of axion masses and decay constants for detectable gravitational wave signals, either in pulsar timing arrays or space-based gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Effects of Nontrivial Topology on Neutron Star Rotation and its Potential Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotational irregularities are one of the prominent observational features that most pulsars exhibit. These glitches, which are sudden increases in spin angular velocity, remains an open problem. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of nontrivial topological defects, specifically in the form of Nambu-goto-type CSs, and its connection to spin irregularities. Such CSs which are one-dimensional topological defects may be formed during various symmetry-breaking and phase transition scenarios and can interact with the neutron stars. In this work, we see that the appearance of such topological defects trapped within the core can lead to the coupling of the string tension with the angular velocity, leading to the abrupt rotational changes observed as pulsar glitches. We have further studied how these coupling may generate detectable gravitational waves as a mixture of continuous and burst signals. The evolution of cusps of CSs trapped within neutron stars and the neutron star's mass quadruple moment change due to rotation could produce distinctive gravitational wave signatures, well within the noise cutoff of advLIGO. Our study highlights a potential connection between topological defects, pulsar glitches, and gravitational wave emissions, offering a possible avenue for observationally testing the presence of CSs and their astrophysical effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation, together with the $\Delta N$ formalism, provides a powerful tool for estimating the large-scale behaviour of primordial fluctuations. We construct a numerical code to capture the non-perturbative statistics of such fluctuations and test our code to obtain the exponential non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbations. We provide a numerical algorithm to compute the non-perturbative curvature power spectrum and apply it to slow-roll (SR) and ultra-slow-roll (USR) single-field models of inflation. For the USR case, we successfully reproduce the peak in the power spectrum, which agrees to a certain accuracy with the perturbative power spectrum. We highlight some important differences between non-perturbative and perturbative approaches that may suggest the inconsistency of the $\Delta N$ formalism at the transition stages between attractor and non-attractor regimes.</description>

Abstract: We argue that topological operators for continuous symmetries written in terms of currents need regularization, which effectively gives them a small but finite width. The regulated operator is a finite tension object which fluctuates. In the zero-width limit these fluctuations freeze, recovering the properties of a topological operator. When gravity is turned on, the zero-width limit becomes ill-defined, thereby prohibiting the existence of topological operators.</description>

      <title>Local Operator Algebras of Charged States in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powerful techniques have been developed in quantum field theory that employ algebras of local operators, yet local operators cannot create physical charged states in gauge theory or physical nonzero-energy states in perturbative quantum gravity. A common method to obtain physical operators out of local ones is to dress the latter using appropriate Wilson lines. This procedure destroys locality, it must be done case by case for each charged operator in the algebra, and it rapidly becomes cumbersome, particularly in perturbative quantum gravity.
  In this paper we present an alternative approach to the definition of physical charged operators: we define an automorphism that maps an algebra of local charged operators into a (non-local) algebra of physical charged operators. The automorphism is described by a formally unitary intertwiner mapping the exact BRS operator associated to the gauge symmetry into its quadratic part.
  The existence of an automorphism between local operators and the physical ones, describing charged states, allows to retain many of the results derived in local operator algebras and extend them to the physical-but-nonlocal algebra of charged operators as we discuss in some simple applications of our construction. We also discuss a formal construction of physical states and possible obstructions to it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the anisotropies in the spectrum of gravitational waves induced by scalar modes after the end of inflation in canonical, single-field models are completely determined by the tilt of the scalar and tensor power spectra. The latter contains information about anisotropies produced due to the propagation of the tensor modes in an inhomogeneous Universe, whereas the former represents the anisotropies generated at the time of production and arise only when non-Gaussian corrections to the angular power spectrum are considered. Our proof takes into account all scalar interactions in the cubic inflaton Lagrangian.</description>

Abstract: We consider cosmological models based on the scalar-torsion gravity implying non-minimal coupling between torsion and the scalar field with certain relations between model's parameters. Based on observational constraints on the values of the parameters of cosmological perturbations, the type of the coupling was determined. It was noted that any inflationary models constructed on the basis of the proposed approach can be verified by observational constraints.</description>

Abstract: Incorporating first-order QED effects, we explore the shadows of Kerr-Newman black holes with a magnetic charge through the numerical backward ray-tracing method. Our investigation accounts for both the direct influence of the electromagnetic field on light rays and the distortion of the background spacetime metric due to QED corrections. We notice that the area of the shadow increases with the QED effect, mainly due to the fact that the photons move more slowly in the effective medium and become easier to be trapped by the black hole.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

Abstract: To understand the nature of the black holes that exist in the Universe, it is also necessary to study what happens to the (quantum) matter that collapses and forms such objects. In this work, we consider a dust ball with an electrically charged central core and study its quantum spectrum by quantising the geodesic equation for individual dust particles in the corresponding Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime. As in the neutral case investigated previously, we find a ground state of the dust ball with the size of a fraction of the outer horizon. Moreover, we determine a self-consistent configuration of layers in the ground state corresponding to an effective mass function that increases linearly with the areal radius and has no inner Cauchy horizon. We then briefly speculate on the possible phenomenological consequences for the endpoint of the gravitational collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) generated by a first-order phase transition at the electroweak scale are detectable by future space-based detectors like LISA. The lifetime of the resulting shock waves plays an important role in determining the intensity of the generated GWs. We have simulated decaying primordial acoustic turbulence in three dimensions and make a prediction for the universal shape of the energy spectrum by using its self-similar decay properties and the shape of individual shock waves. The shape for the spectrum is used to determine the time dependence of the fluid kinetic energy and the energy containing length scale at late times. The inertial range power law is found to be close to the classically predicted $k^{-2}$ and approaches it with increasing Reynolds number. The resulting model for the velocity spectrum and its decay in time is combined with the sound shell model assumptions about the correlations of the velocity field to compute the GW power spectrum for flows that decay in less than the Hubble time. The decay is found to bring about a convergence in the spectral amplitude and the peak power law that leads to a power law shallower than the $k^9$ of the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave emission in Binary Neutron Star early post-merger within a dark environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an effective Lagrangian model inspired by Takami et al. 2015 we qualitatively study the early post-merger of a nearly symmetric binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger event with a non-vanishing ambient fraction of dark matter. For this we first mimic the dynamics of two oscillating Neutron Star (NS) masses in the gravitational potential well as they merge. We parametrize the dynamics and ejecta properties in the coalescence event allowing the formation of a surrounding debris disk that may be containing a non-vanishing dark matter fraction. In order to analyze the possible novel dark contribution, we start from a dark-matter free modellization as a benchmark. Using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques we approximately recover the gravitational waveforms, restricted to early post-merger time interval from existing simulations in the CoRe database. Later, we explore the impact of an additional dark viscous fluid under a prescribed velocity dependent force in the Lagrangian and obtain the resulting waveforms and some spectral features originating in the first few ms in the BNS post-merger. Finally we discuss our qualitative findings and its range of validity in light of the prospects of detectability in present or future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Cannot be Violated in Gedanken Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We innovate a systematic investigation of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) using gedanken experiments involving black hole perturbations by test particles. We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in recent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We provide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous studies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign choice of the parameter $W\equiv \big(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\big)_{Q_i; T=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W &gt; 0$ preserves WCCC and $W &lt; 0$ would indicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W&gt;0$ for spherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue that it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider asymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation either.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the first and second order cosmological perturbation equations in f(R) modified gravity theory and provide the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves. We find that the effects of modified gravity not only change the form of the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves but also contribute an additional anisotropic stress tensor, composed of first order scalar perturbations, to the source term of the gravitational waves. We calculate the energy density spectrum of second order scalar induced gravitational waves in the HS model. Utilizing current pulsar timing array observational data, we perform a rigorous Bayesian analysis of the parameter space of the HS model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Propagation in Starobinsky Inflationary Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we linearize the field equations in the $f(R)$ theory using the Starobinsky model, $R+R^2/(6m^2)$, and explore the impact of modifications to the gravitational field equations on the propagation and structure of gravitational waves. An equation for the trace of the perturbation was then derived and decomposed with the aid of an auxiliary field that obeyed the pure wave equation and was sourced by the matter-energy distribution, while also acting as a fictitious source for generating the actual perturbation via the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green's functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. This trace value was then substituted into the linearized field equation to determine the perturbation tensor in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. We subsequently calculated the components of the quadrupole moment tensor as well as the perturbation tensor for a binary star system and compared them to the General Relativity case. The results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the orbital parameters, specifically: the angular frequency and radius of the system. This suggests that high-frequency binary systems could be promising candidates for detecting the effects of this modified gravity theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10258v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the histories formalism the decoherence functional is a formal tool to investigate the emergence of classicality in isolated quantum systems, yet an explicit evaluation of it from first principles has not been reported. We provide such an evaluation for up to five-time histories based on exact numerical diagonalization of the Schr\"odinger equation. We find a robust emergence of decoherence for slow and coarse observables of a generic random matrix model and extract a finite size scaling law by varying the Hilbert space dimension over four orders of magnitude. Specifically, we conjecture and observe an exponential suppression of coherent effects as a function of the particle number of the system. This suggests a solution to the preferred basis problem of the many worlds interpretation (or the set selection problem of the histories formalism) within a minimal theoretical framework -- without relying on environmentally induced decoherence, quantum Darwinism, Markov approximations, low-entropy initial states or ensemble averages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the timescape cosmology, with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we analyse the Pantheon+ for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. This framework goes far beyond most other definitions of model independence. We introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables refined analysis of the distribution biases of SNe Ia light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x_1$. For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model. Dark energy is generally invoked as a place-holder for new physics. For the first time, we find evidence that the timescape cosmology may provide a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM and that its phenomenology may help disentangle other astrophysical puzzles. Our from-first-principles reanalysis of Pantheon+ supports future deeper studies between the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry in a data-driven setting.</description>

Abstract: We explore nonequilibrium features of certain operator algebras which appear in quantum gravity. The algebra of observables in a black hole background is a Type $\mathrm{II}_\infty$ von Neumann algebra. We discuss how this algebra can be coupled to the algebra of observable of an infinite reservoir within the canonical ensemble, aiming to induce nonequilibrium dynamics. The resulting dynamics can lead the system towards a nonequilibrium steady state which can be characterized through modular theory. Within this framework we address the definition of entropy production and its relationship to relative entropy, alongside exploring other applications.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Hawking's black hole area theorem provides a geometric realization of the second law of thermodynamics and constrains gravitational processes. In this work we explore a one-parameter extension of this constraint formulated in terms of the monotonicity properties of R\'enyi entropies. We focus on black hole mergers in asymptotically AdS space and determine new restrictions which these R\'enyi second laws impose on the final state. We evaluate the entropic inequalities starting from the thermodynamic ensembles description of black hole geometries, and find that for many situations they set more stringent bounds than those imposed by the area increase theorem.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Spin of the Galactic Center Supermassive Black Hole with Two Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a key science project of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the discovery and timing observations of radio pulsars in the Galactic Center would provide high-precision measurements of the spacetime around the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), and initiate novel tests of general relativity. The spin of Sgr A* could be measured with a relative error of $\lesssim 1\%$ by timing one pulsar with timing precision that is achievable for the SKA. However, the real measurements depend on the discovery of a pulsar in a very compact orbit, $P_b\lesssim0.5\,{\rm yr}$. Here for the first time we propose and investigate the possibility of probing the spin of Sgr A* with two or more pulsars that are in orbits with larger orbital periods, $P_b\sim 2- 5\,{\rm yr}$, which represents a more realistic situation from population estimates. We develop a novel method for directly determining the spin of Sgr A* from the timing observables of two pulsars and it can be readily extended for combining more pulsars. With extensive mock data simulations, we show that combining a second pulsar improves the spin measurement by $2-3$ orders of magnitude in some situations, which is comparable to timing a pulsar in a very tight orbit.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems, quantum channels and gravitational algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we study nonequilibrium fluctuations in gravitational algebras within de Sitter space. An essential aspect of this study is quantum measurement theory, which allows us to access the dynamical fluctuations of observables via a two-point measurement scheme. Using this formalism, we establish specific fluctuation theorems. Additionally, we demonstrate that quantum channels are represented by subfactors, using the relationship between measurement theory and quantum channels. We also comment on implementing a quantum channel using Jones' theory of subfactors.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Impact of chaotic magnetic field on mass-radius relation of rotating neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11884v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations reveal that magnetic fields on neutron stars (NSs) are in the range of $10^{8-15}$ G. Apart from being celestial bodies, NSs are normally rotating. In this work, we study the impact of a chaotic magnetic field on the mass-radius relation of the rotating NSs. We employ an equation of state of NSs with the nuclei in the crust and hyperons in the core. We use Hartle-Thorne formalism as an approximation of the rotating NSs. For the magnetic field ansatz, we use the one coupled to the energy density. We find that the magnetic field can decrease radius of NS. NSs formed with stronger chaotic magnetic fields exhibit a lower maximum mass compared to those formed with weaker chaotic magnetic fields. In contrast, the increment of the magnetic field can increase the compactness and deformation of rotating NSs.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds II: Constraints on the spectral index and gravitational dark matter production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way accretion history compared to cosmological simulations -- from bulge to dwarf galaxy infall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic halos are known to grow hierarchically, inside out. This implies a correlation between the infall lookback time of satellites and their binding energy. Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall lookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter. Gaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf satellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic energies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky Way, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of the galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be compared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the infall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological simulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total Milky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This agrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from the rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear outliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In other words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to Sgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted much later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in some cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to identified Milky Way substructures. This leads to an overestimated impact of satellites on the Galaxy rotation curve.</description>
