      <title>The codegree isomorphism problem for finite simple groups II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a nonabelian finite simple group. Huppert's conjecture asserts that if $G$ is a finite group with the same set of complex character degrees as $H$, then $G\cong H\times A$ for some abelian group $A$. Over the past two decades, several specific cases of this conjecture have been addressed. Recently, attention has shifted to the analogous conjecture for character codegrees: if $G$ has the same set of character codegrees as $H$, then $G\cong H$. Unfortunately, both problems have primarily been examined on a case-by-case basis. In this paper and the companion [HM22], we present a more unified approach to the codegree conjecture and confirm it for several families of simple groups.</description>

      <title>On the conjecture of non-inner automorphisms of finite $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. A longstanding conjecture asserts that every finite non-abelian $p$-group has a non-inner automorphism of order $p$. In this paper, we prove that if $G$ is an odd order finite non-abelian monolithic $p$-group such that every maximal subgroup of $G$ is non-abelian and $[Z(M), g] \leq Z(G)$ for every maximal subgroup $M$ of $G$ and $g \in G \setminus M$. Then $G$ has a non-inner automorphism of order $p$ leaving the Frattini subgroup $\Phi(G)$ elementwise fixed.</description>

      <title>More on Landau's theorem and Conjugacy Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We construct a function $f$ on the natural numbers such that $f(x) \to \infty$ as $x \to \infty$ and $k_{p}(G)+k_{p'}(G)\geq f(|G|)$ for all finite groups $G$. Here $k_{p}(G)$ denotes the number of conjugacy classes of nontrivial $p$-elements in $G$ and $k_{p'}(G)$ denotes the number of conjugacy classes of elements of $G$ whose orders are coprime to $p$. This is a variation of an old theorem of Landau and is used to prove the following: There exists a number $c$ such that whenever $p$ is a prime and $G$ is a finite group of order divisible by $p$ with $|G|&gt;c$, there exists a factorization $p-1 = ab$ with $a$ and $b$ positive integers such that $k_{p}(G) \geq a$ and $k_{p'}(G) \geq b$ with equalities in both cases if and only if $G=C_p \rtimes C_b$ with $C_G(C_p) = C_p$.</description>

      <title>The subgroup structure of pseudo-reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field. We investigate the relationship between subgroups of a pseudo-reductive $k$-group $G$ and its maximal reductive quotient $G'$, with applications to the subgroup structure of $G$. Let $k'/k$ be the minimal field of definition for the geometric unipotent radical of $G$, and let $\pi':G_{k'} \to G'$ be the quotient map. We first characterise those smooth subgroups $H$ of $G$ for which $\pi'(H_{k'})=G'$. We next consider the following questions: given a subgroup $H'$ of $G'$, does there exist a subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that $\pi'(H_{k'})=H'$, and if $H'$ is smooth can we find such a $H$ that is smooth? We find sufficient conditions for a positive answer to these questions. In general there are various obstructions to the existence of such a subgroup $H$, which we illustrate with several examples. Finally, we apply these results to relate the maximal smooth subgroups of $G$ with those of $G'$.</description>

      <title>Non-freeness of parabolic two-generator groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex number $\lambda$ is said to be non-free if the subgroup of $SL(2,\bc)$ generated by $$X=\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; 1\\ 0 &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix} \,\, \text{and}\,\,\,Y_{\lambda}=\begin{pmatrix} 1&amp; 0\\ \lambda &amp; 1
  \end{pmatrix}$$ is not a free group of rank 2. In this case the number $\lambda$ is called a relation number, and it has been a long standing problem to determine the relation numbers. In this paper, we characterize the relation numbers by establishing the equivalence between $\lambda$ being a relation number and $u:=\sqrt{- \lambda}$ being a root of a `generalized Chebyshev polynomial'. The generalized Chebyshev polynomials of degree $k$ are given by a sequence of $k$ integers $(n_1, n_2,\cdots, n_k)$ using the usual recursive formula, and thereby can be studied systematically using continuants and continued fractions. Such formulation, then, enables us to prove that, the question whether a given number $\lambda$ is a relation number of $u$-degree $k$ can be answered by checking only finitely many generalized Chebyshev polynomials. Based on these theorems, we design an algorithm deciding any given number is a relation number with minimal degree $k$. With its computer implementation we provide a few sample examples, with a particular emphasis on the well known conjecture that every rational number in the interval $(-4, 4)$ is a relation number.</description>

      <title>On entropy Marton-type inequalities and small symmetric differences with cosets of abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recognise that an entropy inequality akin to the main intermediate goal of recent works (Gowers, Green, Manners, Tao [3],[2]) regarding a conjecture of Marton provides a black box from which we can also through a short deduction recover another description: if a finite subset $A$ of an abelian group $G$ is such that the distribution of the sums $a+b$ with $(a,b) \in A \times A$ is only slightly more spread out than the uniform distribution on $A$, then $A$ has small symmetric difference with some finite coset of $G$. The resulting bounds are necessarily sharp up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12269v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the planar $3$-colorable subgroup $\mathcal{E}$ of Thompson's group $F$ and its even part $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$. The latter is obtained by cutting $\mathcal{E}$ with a finite index subgroup of $F$ isomorphic to $F$, namely the rectangular subgroup $K_{(2,2)}$. We show that the even part $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$ of the planar $3$-colorable subgroup admits a description in terms of stabilisers of suitable subsets of dyadic rationals. As a consequence $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$ is closed in the sense of Golan and Sapir. We then study three quasi-regular representations associated with $\mathcal{E}_{\rm EVEN}$: two are shown to be irreducible and one to be reducible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish vanishing results for limits of characters in various discrete groups, most notably irreducible lattices in higher rank semisimple Lie groups. As an application, we show that any sequence of finite-dimensional representations converges to the regular representation in the Fell topology. We achieve this by studying the geometry of the simplex of traces of discrete groups having Kazhdan's property (T) or its relative generalizations.</description>

      <title>The quasi-isometry invariance of the Coset Intersection Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ consisting of a group and finite collection of subgroups, we introduce a simplicial $G$-complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ called the coset intersection complex. We prove that the quasi-isometry type and the homotopy type of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ are quasi-isometric invariants of the group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. Classical properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ correspond to topological or geometric properties of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$, such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. For a certain class of right-angled Artin groups and their maximal parabolic subgroups, we show that the complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ is quasi-isometric to the Extension graph; in particular, it is quasi-isometric to a tree.</description>

      <title>A normal version of Brauer's height zero conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated It\^o-Michler theorem asserts that a prime $p$ does not divide the degree of any irreducible character of a finite group $G$ if and only if $G$ has a normal and abelian Sylow $p$-subgroup. The principal block case of the recently-proven Brauer's height zero conjecture isolates the abelian part in the It\^o-Michler theorem. In this paper, we show that the normal part can also be isolated in a similar way. This is a consequence of work on a strong form of the so-called Brauer's height zero conjecture for two primes of Malle and Navarro. Using our techniques, we also provide an alternate proof of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Mesh Neural Networks for SE(3)-Equivariant Hemodynamics Estimation on the Artery Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a valuable asset for patient-specific cardiovascular-disease diagnosis and prognosis, but its high computational demands hamper its adoption in practice. Machine-learning methods that estimate blood flow in individual patients could accelerate or replace CFD simulation to overcome these limitations. In this work, we consider the estimation of vector-valued quantities on the wall of three-dimensional geometric artery models. We employ group equivariant graph convolution in an end-to-end SE(3)-equivariant neural network that operates directly on triangular surface meshes and makes efficient use of training data. We run experiments on a large dataset of synthetic coronary arteries and find that our method estimates directional wall shear stress (WSS) with an approximation error of 7.6% and normalised mean absolute error (NMAE) of 0.4% while up to two orders of magnitude faster than CFD. Furthermore, we show that our method is powerful enough to accurately predict transient, vector-valued WSS over the cardiac cycle while conditioned on a range of different inflow boundary conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of our proposed method as a plugin replacement for CFD in the personalised prediction of hemodynamic vector and scalar fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a structure theorem for stable functions on amenable groups, which extends the arithmetic regularity lemma for stable subsets of finite groups. Given a group $G$, a function $f\colon G\to [-1,1]$ is called stable if the binary function $f(x\cdot y)$ is stable in the sense of continuous logic. Roughly speaking, our main result says that if $G$ is amenable, then any stable function on $G$ is almost constant on all translates of a unitary Bohr neighborhood in $G$ of bounded complexity. The proof uses ingredients from topological dynamics and continuous model theory. We also prove several applications which generalize results in arithmetic combinatorics to nonabelian groups.</description>

      <title>A refined Weyl character formula for comodules on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,K}$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and $\operatorname{SL}_{2,A}$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positiv characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  We apply this result to settle a number of problems in computational group theory. We show that it is undecidable whether a system of equations has solutions in the wreath product $\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, providing a negative answer to an open problem of Kharlampovich, L\'{o}pez and Miasnikov (2020). We show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the problem of solving a single quadratic equation is undecidable. We also construct a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group, different to that of Mishchenko and Treier (2017), in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>
