      <title>Hormander-Mikhlin type theorem on non-commutative spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Fourier-type formalism on non-commutative spaces. As a result, we obtain two versions of Hormander-Mikhlin Lp-multiplier theorem: on locally compact Kac groups and on semi-finite von Neumann algebras, respectively. In the simplest case our result coincides with a sharp version of the classical Hormander Lp-multiplier theorem, which was obtained by Grafakos and Slavikova in [11]. Finally, we present some applications to the evolution equation in non-commutative setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrics from length functions on quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum metric structure arising from length functions on quantum groups and show that for coamenable quantum groups of Kac type, the quantum metric information is captured by the algebra of central functions. Using this, we provide the first examples of length functions on (genuine) quantum groups which give rise to compact quantum metric spaces.</description>

      <title>A Family of Semi-norms in $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of non-negative real-valued functions on a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$, i.e., for $0\leq \mu \leq 1,$ $$\|a\|_{\sigma_{\mu}}= \text{sup}\left\lbrace \sqrt{|f(a)|^2 \sigma_{\mu} f(a^*a)}: f\in \mathcal{A}', \, f(1)=\|f\|=1 \right\rbrace, \quad $$ where $a\in \mathcal{A}$ and $\sigma_{\mu}$ is an interpolation path of the symmetric mean $\sigma$. These functions are semi-norms as they satisfy the norm axioms, except for the triangle inequality. Special cases satisfying triangle inequality, and a complete equality characterization is also discussed. Various bounds and relationships will be established for this new family, with a connection to the existing literature in the algebra of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of unitary elements of C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [5] the author conjectures and partially shows that the Cuntz semigroup classifies unitary elements of unital AF-algebras. We provide a complete proof by addressing the existence part of the conjecture, under a mild adjustment of both domain and codomain of the functor Cu. We also tackle the classification beyond the AF case and more particularly, we look at unitary elements of what we call AH$_1$-algebras. We obtain positive progress as far as the existence part is concerned. Nevertheless, we reveal that extra information is needed for the uniqueness part of the classification that the Cuntz semigroup fails to capture.</description>

      <title>On Fock covariance for product systems and the reduced Hao-Ng isomorphism problem by discrete actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of equivariant Fock covariant injective representations for product systems. We show that this characterisation coincides with Nica covariance for compactly aligned product systems over right LCM semigroups of Kwa\'{s}niewski and Larsen, and with the Toeplitz representations of a discrete monoid of Laca and Sehnem. By combining with the framework established by Katsoulis and Ramsey, we resolve the reduced Hao-Ng isomorphism problem for generalised gauge actions by discrete groups.</description>

      <title>Constructing equivalences between fusion categories of quantum groups and of vertex operator algebras via quantum gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the structure of proof of our results on a problem that Sergio Doplicher posed in the 90s in the setting of conformal nets, and on a related problem posed by Yi-Zhi Huang in the setting of vertex operator algebras. The latter asks to find a direct construction of an equivalence due to Finkelberg between the quantum group modular fusion category at certain roots of unity and the fusion categories of affine vertex operator algebras at positive integer levels. The former asks for the construction of a quantum gauge group and field algebra for the category of localized endomorphisms of a conformal net, extending Doplicher-Roberts theory of the compact gauge group and field algebra in high dimensional AQFT. We mostly focus on the affine VOA aspects. We solve Huang's problem for all the Lie types for which it is known that the centralizer algebra of the truncated tensor powers of the given generating object V listed by Hans Wenzl in 1998 for the quantum group fusion categories is generated by the representation of braid group associated to the R-matrix and for Huang-Lepowsky ribbon braided tensor structure. In the classical type A, this property becomes the classical Schur-Weyl duality and was used by Doplicher and Roberts to construct SU(d) as a special case of their unique compact gauge group and field algebra in algebraic QFT. Presently, known results in the literature allow to construct the full equivalence for the Lie types A, B, C, D, G_2 and partial equivalence for braiding and associativity morphisms in the Lie types E and F. We also solve a question posed by Frenkel and Zhu in 1992 on the quantum group structure on the Zhu algebra for all Lie types. Our main tool is the construction of a quantum gauge group and a Drinfeld twist method. The structures we find in both contexts extend Doplicher-Roberts symmetric functors which played a central role in their duality theory.</description>

      <title>Fully noncentral Lie ideals and invariant additive subgroups in rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove conditions ensuring that a Lie ideal or an invariant additive subgroup in a ring contains all additive commutators. A crucial assumption is that the subgroup is fully noncentral, that is, its image in every quotient is noncentral.
  For a unital algebra over a field of characteristic $\neq 2$ where every additive commutator is a sum of square-zero elements, we show that a fully noncentral subspace is a Lie ideal if and only if it is invariant under all inner automorphisms. This applies in particular to zero-product balanced algebras.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz algebra of bounded symmetric domains: A quantum harmonic analysis approach via localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Toeplitz operators are norm dense in the Toeplitz algebra $\mathfrak{T}(L^\infty)$ over the weighted Bergman space $\mathcal{A}^2_\nu(\Omega)$ of a bounded symmetric domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n$. Our methods use representation theory, quantum harmonic analysis, and weakly-localized operators. Additionally, we note that the set of all $\alpha$-weakly-localized operators form a self-adjoint algebra, containing the set of all Toeplitz operators, whose norm closure coincides with the Toeplitz algebra.</description>

      <title>A notion of fractality for a class of states and noncommutative relative distance zeta functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [36, 37, 38, 40, 41] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [9].</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all fusion categories. It then extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under specific positivity constraints, encompassing all pseudo-unitary fusion categories. The primary tools employed in this study are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories.
  Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
