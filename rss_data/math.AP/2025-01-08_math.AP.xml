      <title>Higher order div-curl type estimates for elliptic linear differential operators on localizable Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present higher order div-curl type estimates in the sense of Coifman, Lions, Meyer &amp; Semmes in the local setup of elliptic linear differential operators with smooth coefficients on localizable Hardy spaces. Our version implies and extends results obtained for first order operators associated to elliptic systems and complexes of vector fields. As tools, with own interest, we develop a new smooth atomic decomposition on localizable Hardy-Sobolev spaces and a Poincar\'e type inequality.</description>

      <title>Interior regularity estimates for fully nonlinear equations with arbitrary nonhomogeneous degeneracy laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study regularity estimates for a class of degenerate, fully nonlinear elliptic equations with arbitrary nonhomogeneous degeneracy laws. We establish that viscosity solutions are locally continuously differentiable under suitable conditions on the degeneracy laws. Our proof employs improvement of flatness techniques alongside an alternative recursive algorithm for renormalizing the approximating solutions, linking our model to the homogeneous, fully nonlinear, uniformly elliptic equation.</description>

      <title>Global hypoellipticity for a class of evolution operators in time-periodic weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hypoellipticity properties of a class of time-periodic evolution operators, with coefficients globally defined on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and growing polynomially with respect to the space variable. To this aim, we introduce a class of time-periodic weighted Sobolev spaces, whose elements are characterised in terms of suitable Fourier expansions, associated with elliptic operators.</description>

      <title>Existence of weak solutions to volume-preserving mean curvature flow with obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of global-in-time weak solutions to volume-preserving mean curvature flow with in the presence of obstacles by the phase field method in spatial dimensions two and three. Namely, we prove the convergence of solutions to the Allen-Cahn equation with a multiplier to a family of integral varifolds, which is a weak solution to the flow. The choice of the multiplier is motivated from \cite{MSS16,KK20,T23}, which enables us to complete the comparison between the multiplier and the forcing that stops the intrusion into the obstacle.</description>

      <title>A Priori Log-Concavity Estimates for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a priori log-concavity estimates for the first Dirichlet eigenfunction of convex domains of a Riemannian manifold. Specifically, we focus on cases where the principal eigenfunction $u$ is assumed to be log-concave and our primary goal is to obtain quantitative estimates for the Hessian of $\log u$.</description>

      <title>The $b$-equation on $\mathbb{R}^n$: a geometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a geometric interpretation of the higher-dimensional $b$-equation as the geodesic equation of a right-invariant affine connection $\nabla$ on the diffeomorphism group of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We then use this framework to demonstrate local well-posedness of the $b$-equation with a Fourier multiplier of order $r\ge1$ as the inertia operator in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^n)$ for any $s&gt; n/2+1$ with $s\ge r$. This is achieved by rewriting the $b$-equation as a smooth ODE on the Hilbert manifold $T\mathcal{D}^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, allowing one to obtain local well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^n)$ via Picard-Lindel\"{o}f. This result is transferred to the smooth category by showing that there is no loss of spatial regularity during the time evolution of the $b$-equation, which yields local well-posedness in $H^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^n).$</description>

      <title>A Liouville theorem for supercritical Fujita equation and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Liouville theorem for ancient solutions to the supercritical Fujita equation \[\partial_tu-\Delta u=|u|^{p-1}u, \quad -\infty &lt;t&lt;0, \quad p&gt;\frac{n+2}{n-2},\] which says if $u$ is close to the ODE solution $u_0(t):=(p-1)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}(-t)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}$ at large scales, then it is an ODE solution (i.e. it depends only on $t$). This implies a stability property for ODE blow ups in this problem.
  As an application of these results, we show that for a suitable weak solution, its singular set at the end time can be decomposed into two parts: one part is relatively open and $(n-1)$-rectifiable, and it is characterized by the property that tangent functions at these points are the two constants $\pm(p-1)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}$; the other part is relatively closed and its Hausdorff dimension is not larger than $n-\left[2\frac{p+1}{p-1}\right]-1$.</description>

      <title>On Choquard-Kirchhoff Type Critical Multiphase Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the existence of weak solutions to the Choquard-Kirchhoff type critical multiphase problem: \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
  &amp;-M(\varphi_{\h}(\lvert{\nabla u}\rvert))div(\lvert{\nabla u}\rvert^{p(x)-2}\nabla u+a_1(x)\lvert{\nabla u}\rvert^{q(x)-2}\nabla u+a_2(x)\lvert{\nabla u}\rvert^{r(x)-2}\nabla u)
  &amp; =\lambda g(x)\lvert{u}\rvert^{\gamma(x)-2}u+\theta B(x,u)+\kappa \left(\int_{\q}\frac{F(y,u(y))}{\lvert{x-y}\rvert^{d(x,y)}}\, dy\right) f(x,u) \ \text{in} \ \Omega,
  &amp; u=0 \ \text{on} \ {\partial \Omega}. \end{array}\right. \end{equation*}
  The term $B(x,u)$ on the right-hand side generalizes the critical growth. We obtain existence and multiplicity results by establishing certain embedding results and concentration compactness principle along with the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev type inequality for the Musielak Orlicz Sobolev space $ W^{1,\mathcal{T}}(\q)$.</description>

      <title>New Liouville type theorems for the stationary Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mainly research the Liouville type problem for the stationary Navier-Stokes equations (including the fractional case) in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We first establish a new formula for the Dirichlet integral of solutions and show that the globally defined quantity $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}|\nabla u|^2dx$ is completely determined by the information of the solution $u$ at the origin in frequency space. From this character, we show some new Liouville type theorems for solutions of the stationary Navier-Stokes equations. Then we extend the obtained results for classical stationary Navier-Stokes equations to the stationary fractional Navier-Stokes equations for $\frac{1}{2}\leq s&lt;1$, especially, we solve the Liouville type problem for $s=\frac{5}{6}$.</description>

      <title>Liouville-type theorem for the stationary inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, a new Liouville-type theorem for the three-dimensional stationary inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations is established. We first localize the Dirichlet energy into the region near the origin in frequency spaces by two times localizations. The first localization is to eliminate the non-zero frequency part coming from the interaction between $\rho u$ and $u$, the second one is to eliminate the non-zero frequency part coming from the interaction between $\rho$ and $u$. Based on the local formula of Dirichlet energy, we can establish suitable estimates on different frequency parts of $u$ and $\rho$, then show our new Liouville-type theorem.</description>

Abstract: We study the surjectivity of the Cauchy-Riemann and Laplace operators on certain weighted spaces of smooth functions of rapid decay on strip-like domains in the complex plane that are defined via weight function systems. We fully characterize when these operators are surjective on such function spaces in terms of a growth condition on the defining weight function systems.</description>

      <title>Curved fronts of bistable reaction-diffusion equations in spatially periodic media: $N\ge 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with curved fronts of bistable reaction-diffusion equations in spatially periodic media for dimensions $N\geq 2$. The curved fronts concerned are transition fronts connecting $0$ and $1$. Under a priori assumption that there exist moving pulsating fronts in every direction, we show the existence of polytope-like curved fronts with $0$-zone being a polytope and $1$-zone being the complementary set. By reversing some conditions, we also show the existence of curved fronts with reversed $0$-zone and $1$-zone. Furthermore, the curved fronts constructed by us are proved to be unique and asymptotic stable.</description>

      <title>Impact of diffusion mechanisms on persistence and spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a generalized KPP equation with a ``$q$-diffusion", which is a framework that unifies various standard linear diffusion regimes: Fickian diffusion ($q = 0$), Stratonovich diffusion ($q = 1/2$), Fokker-Planck diffusion ($q = 1$), and nonstandard diffusion regimes for general $q\in\mathbb{R}$. Using both analytical methods and numerical simulations, we explore how the ability of persistence (measured by some principal eigenvalue) and how the asymptotic spreading speed depend on the parameter $q$ and on the phase shift between the growth rate $r(x)$ and the diffusion coefficient $D(x)$.
  Our results demonstrate that persistence and spreading properties generally depend on $q$: for example, appropriate configurations of $r(x)$ and $D(x)$ can be constructed such that $q$-diffusion either enhances or diminishes the ability of persistence and the spreading speed with respect to the traditional Fickian diffusion. We show that the spatial arrangement of $r(x)$ with respect to $D(x)$ has markedly different effects depending on whether $q &gt; 0$, $q = 0$, or $q &lt; 0$. The case where $r$ is constant is an exception: persistence becomes independent of $q$, while the spreading speed displays a symmetry around $q = 1/2$.
  This work underscores the importance of carefully selecting diffusion models in ecological and epidemiological contexts, highlighting their potential implications for persistence, spreading, and control strategies.</description>

      <title>Existence and limiting profile of energy ground states for a quasi-linear Schr\"odinger equations: Mass super-critical case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any dimension $N \geq 1$, for given mass $a&gt;0$, we look to critical points of the energy functional
  $$ I(u) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|\nabla u|^2 dx + \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}u^2|\nabla u|^2 dx - \frac{1}{p}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^p dx$$ constrained to the set
  $$\mathcal{S}_a=\{ u \in X | \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}| u|^2 dx = a\},$$
  where $$ X:=\left\{u \in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)\Big| \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u^2|\nabla u|^2 dx &lt;\infty\right\}. $$
  We focus on the mass super-critical case $$4+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p&lt;2\cdot 2^*, \quad \mbox{where } 2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2} \quad \mbox{for } N\geq 3, \quad \mbox{while } 2^*:=+\infty \quad \mbox{for } N=1,2.$$ We explicit a set $\mathcal{P}_a \subset \mathcal{S}_a$ which contains all the constrained critical points and study the existence of a minimum to the problem \begin{equation*} M_{a}:=\inf_{\mathcal{P}_{a}}I(u). \end{equation*} A minimizer of $M_a$ corresponds to an energy ground state. We prove that $M_a$ is achieved for all mass $a&gt;0$ when $1\leq N\leq 4$. For $N\geq 5$, we find an explicit number $a_0$ such that the existence of minimizer is true if and only if $a\in (0, a_0]$.
  In the mass super-critical case, the existence of a minimizer to the problem $M_a$, or more generally the existence of a constrained critical point of $I$ on $\mathcal{S}_a$, had hitherto only been obtained by assuming that $p \leq 2^*$. In particular, the restriction $N \leq 3$ was necessary.
  We also study the asymptotic behavior of the minimizers to $M_a$ as the mass $a \downarrow 0$, as well as when $a \uparrow a^*$, where $a^*=+\infty$ for $1\leq N\leq 4$, while $a^*=a_0$ for $N\geq 5$.</description>

      <title>On gelation for the Smoluchowski equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent results of Andreis-Iyer-Magnanini (2023), we provide a short proof, revisiting the one of Escobedo-Mischler-Perthame (2002), that for a large class of coagulation kernels, any weak solution to the Smoluchowski equation looses mass in finite time. The class of kernels we consider is essentially the same as the one of Andreis-Iyer-Magnanini (2023): homogeneous kernels of degree $\gamma&gt;1$ not vanishing on the diagonal, or homogeneous kernels of degree $\gamma=1$ not vanishing on the diagonal with some additional logarithmic factor. We also show that when $\gamma=1$, the power of the logarithmic factor ensuring gelation may depend on the shape of the kernel.</description>

      <title>An obstruction to small-time local controllability for a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the small-time local controllability in the vicinity of the ground state of a bilinear Schr\"odinger equation with Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that, when the linearized system is not controllable, the nonlinear system is not controllable, due to a quadratic obstruction involving the squared norm of the control's primitive. This obstruction has been known since 1983 for ODEs and observed for some PDEs since 2006. However, our situation is more intricate since the kernel describing the quadratic expansion of the solution is not twice differentiable. We thus follow a Fourier-based approach, closer to the one used for quadratic obstructions of fractional Sobolev regularity.
  In this Fourier-based approach, a challenge is to formulate a necessary and sufficient condition on the convolution kernel, for the quadratic form to be coercive. In previous studies, the coercivity was ensured by a signed asymptotic equivalent for the Fourier transform of the convolution kernel of the form $\widehat{K}(\omega) \sim \omega^{-2}$ as $|\omega| \to \infty$. In our case, $\widehat{K}$ is a distribution which has singularities and changes sign up to infinity. We still prove coercivity because one of the signs appears too infrequently.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Hessian quotient equations on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Hessian quotient equations in Riemannian setting related to a problem posed by Delano\"e and Urbas. We prove unobstructed second order a priori estimate for the real Hessian quotient equation via the maximum principle argument on Riemannian manifolds in dimension two. This is achieved by introducing new test function and exploiting some fine concavity properties of quotient operator. This result demonstrates that there is intriguing difference between the real case and the complex case, as there are known obstructions for $J$-equation in complex geometry.</description>

      <title>Sharp two-weight inequality for fractional maximal operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to two-weight estimates for the fractional maximal operators $\mathcal{M}^\alpha$ on general probability spaces equipped with a tree-like structure. For given $1&lt;p\leq q&lt;\infty$, we study the sharp universal upper bound for the norm $ \|\mathcal{M}^\alpha\|_{L^p(v)\to L^q(u)}$, where $(u,v)$ is an arbitrary pair of weights satisfying the Sawyer testing condition. The proof is based on the abstract Bellman function method, which reveals an unexpected connection of the above problem with the sharp version of the classical Sobolev imbedding theorem.</description>

      <title>On the $N_\infty$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with linear dispersion and vanishing boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the $N_{\infty}$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with linear dispersion and boundaries vanishing at infinity: $m_t+(m(u^2-u_x^2)^2)_x+\kappa u_x=0,\quad m=u-u_{xx}$ with $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pm \infty }u(x,t)=0$. We mainly analyze the aggregation state of $N$-soliton solutions of the mCH equation expressed by the solution of the modified Riemann-Hilbert problem in the new $(y,t)$-space when the discrete spectra are located in different regions. Starting from the modified RH problem, we find that i) when the region is a quadrature domain with $\ell=n=1$, the corresponding $N_{\infty}$-soliton is the one-soliton solution which the discrete spectral point is the center of the region; ii) when the region is a quadrature domain with $\ell=n$, the corresponding $N_{\infty}$-soliton is an $n$-soliton solution; iii) when the discrete spectra lie in the line region, we provide its corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem,; and iv) when the discrete spectra lie in an elliptic region, it is equivalent to the case of the line region.</description>

      <title>On Large-Space and Long-Time Asymptotic Behaviors of Kink-Soliton Gases in the Sine-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the large-space and long-time asymptotics of kink-soliton gases in the sine-Gordon (sG) equation, addressing an important open problem highlighted in the recent work [Phys. Rev. E 109 (2024) 061001]. We focus on kink-soliton gases modeled within a Riemann-Hilbert framework and characterized by two types of generalized reflection coefficients, each defined on the interval $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$: $r_0(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} |\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0} \gamma(\lambda)$ and $r_c(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} \chi_c(\lambda) \gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$, \(\gamma(\lambda)\) is a continuous, strictly positive function defined on $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$. The function \(\chi_c(\lambda)\) demonstrates a step-like behavior: it is given by \(\chi_c(\lambda) = 1\) for \(\lambda \in [\eta_1, \eta_0)\) and \(\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2\) for \(\lambda \in (\eta_0, \eta_2]\), with \(c\) as a positive constant distinct from one. To rigorously derive the asymptotic results, we leverage the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. A central component of this approach is constructing an appropriate \(g\)-function for the conjugation process. Unlike in the KdV equation, the sG presents unique challenges for \(g\)-function formulation, particularly concerning the singularity at the origin. The Riemann-Hilbert problem also requires carefully constructed local parametrices near endpoints \(\eta_j\) and the singularity \(\eta_0\). At the endpoints \(\eta_j\), we employ a modified Bessel parametrix of the first kind. For the singularity \(\eta_0\), the parametrix selection depends on the reflection coefficient: the second kind of modified Bessel parametrix is used for \(r_0(\lambda)\), while a confluent hypergeometric parametrix is applied for \(r_c(\lambda)\).</description>

      <title>Turbulence modeling over riblets via domain transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical and experimental studies have demonstrated the drag-reducing potential of carefully designed streamwise-elongated riblets in lowering skin-friction drag. To support the systematic design of such surface corrugations, recent efforts have integrated simplified versions of the governing equations with innovative methods for representing the effects of rough boundaries on flow dynamics. Notably, the statistical response of the eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearized Navier-Stokes equations has been shown to effectively capture the ability of riblets in suppressing turbulence, quantify the influence of background turbulence on the mean velocity, and reproduce established drag-reduction trends. In this paper, we enhance the flexibility and computational efficiency of this simulation-free approach by implementing a domain transformation for surface representation, along with a perturbation analysis on a small geometric parameter of the riblets. While domain transformation complicates the differential equations, it provides accurate boundary representations and facilitates the analysis of complex riblet shapes at high Reynolds numbers by enabling perturbation analysis to simplify the dimensional complexity of the governing equations. Our method successfully predicts drag reduction trends for semi-circular riblets, consistent with existing literature. We further utilize our framework to investigate flow mechanisms influenced by riblets and extend our study to channel flows with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2003. Our findings reveal the emergence of Kelvin-Helmholtz rollers over large and sharp semi-circular riblets, contributing to the degradation of drag reduction in these geometries. Additionally, we examine the impact of riblets on near-wall flow structures, focusing on their suppression of streamwise-elongated structures in flows over large riblets.</description>

      <title>Shape Taylor expansion for wave scattering problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taylor expansion of wave fields with respect to shape parameters has a wide range of applications in wave scattering problems, including inverse scattering, optimal design, and uncertainty quantification. However, deriving the high order shape derivatives required for this expansion poses significant challenges with conventional methods. This paper addresses these difficulties by introducing elegant recurrence formulas for computing high order shape derivatives. The derivation employs tools from exterior differential forms, Lie derivatives, and material derivatives. The work establishes a unified framework for computing the high order shape perturbations in scattering problems. In particular, the recurrence formulas are applicable to both acoustic and electromagnetic scattering models under a variety of boundary conditions, including Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, and transmission types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entropic regularizations of optimal transport problems under suitable summability assumptions on the point-wise transport cost. These summability assumptions already appear in the literature. However, we show that the weakest compactness conditions that can be derived are already enough to obtain the convergence of the regularized functionals. This approach allows us to characterize the variational limit of the regularization even when it does not converge to the original problem. The results apply also to problems with more than two marginals.</description>

      <title>On generalized Mittag-Leffler-type functions of two variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to study Mittag-Leffler type functions of two variables ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right),...,{{D}_{5}}\left( x,y \right)$ by analogy with the Appell hypergeometric functions of two variables. Moreover, we targeted functions ${{E}_{1}}\left( x,y \right),$ $...,{{E}_{10}}\left( x,y \right)$ as limiting cases of the functions ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right),$ $...,{{D}_{5}}\left( x,y \right)$ and studied certain properties, as well. Following Horn's method, we determine all possible cases of the convergence region of the function ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right).$ Further, for a generalized hypergeometric function, ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right)$ (two variable Mittag-Leffler-type function) integral representations of the Euler type have been proved. One-dimensional and two-dimensional Laplace transforms of the function are also defined. We have constructed a system of partial differential equations which is linked with the function ${{D}_{1}}\left( x,y \right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator ${\cal N}$ associated with a general elliptic operator \[ {\cal A} u = - \sum_{k,l=1}^d \partial_k (c_{kl}\, \partial_l u) + \sum_{k=1}^d \Big( c_k\, \partial_k u - \partial_k (b_k\, u) \Big) +c_0\, u \in {\cal D}'(\Omega) \] with possibly complex coefficients. We study three problems:
  1) Boundedness on $C^\nu$ and on $L_p$ of the commutator $[{\cal N}, M_g]$, where $M_g$ denotes the multiplication operator by a smooth function $g$.
  2) H\"older and $L_p$-bounds for the harmonic lifting associated with ${\cal A}$.
  3) Poisson bounds for the heat kernel of ${\cal N}$.
  We solve these problems in the case where the coefficients are H\"older continuous and the underlying domain is bounded and of class $C^{1+\kappa}$ for some $\kappa &gt; 0$. For the Poisson bounds we assume in addition that the coefficients are real-valued. We also prove gradient estimates for the heat kernel and the Green function $G$ of the elliptic operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior toward viscous shock for impermeable wall and inflow problem of barotropic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations in a half-line and study the time-asymptotic behavior toward the outgoing viscous shock wave. Precisely, we consider the two boundary problems: impermeable wall and inflow problems, where the velocity at the boundary is given as a constant state. For both problems, when the asymptotic profile determined by the prescribed constant states at the boundary and far-fields is a viscous shock, we show that the solution asymptotically converges to the shifted viscous shock profiles uniformly in space, under the condition that initial perturbation is small enough in $H^1$ norm. Since our method works on the physical variables, we do not require that the anti-derivative variables belong to $L^2$ space as in \cite{HMS03,MM99}. Moreover, for the inflow case, we remove the assumption $\gamma\le 3$ in \cite{HMS03}. Our results are based on the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, as the first extension of the method to the boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Rigorous fast signal diffusion limit and convergence rates with the initial layer effect in a competitive chemotaxis system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a chemotaxis system that includes two competitive prey and one predator species in a two-dimensional domain, where the movement of prey (resp. predators) is driven by chemicals secreted by predators (resp. prey), called mutually repulsive (resp. mutually attractive) chemotaxis effect. The kinetics for all species are chosen according to the competitive Lotka-Volterra equations for prey and to a Holling type functional response for the predator. Under the biologically relevant scenario that the chemicals diffuse much faster than the individual diffusion of all species and a suitable re-scaling, equations for chemical concentrations are parabolic with slow evolution of coefficient $0&lt;\varepsilon\ll 1$. The first main result shows the global existence of a unique classical solution to the system for each $\varepsilon$. Secondly, we study rigorously the so-called fast signal diffusion limit, passing from the system including parabolic equations with the slow evolution to the one with all elliptic equations for chemical concentrations, i.e. the limit as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This explains why elliptic equations can be proposed for chemical concentration instead of parabolic ones with slow evolution. Thirdly, the $L^\infty$-in-time convergence rates for the fast signal diffusion limit are estimated, where the effect of the initial layer is carefully treated. Finally, the differences between the systems with and without the slow evolution, and between the systems with one or two preys are discussed by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We prove piecewise Sobolev regularity of vector fields that have piecewise regular curl and divergence, but may fail to be globally continuous. The main idea behind our approach is to employ recently developed parametrices for the curl-operator and the regularity theory of Poisson transmission problems. We conclude our work by applying our findings to the heterogeneous time-harmonic Maxwell equations with either a) impedance, b) natural or c) essential boundary conditions and providing wavenumber-explicit piecewise regularity estimates for these equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the local well-posedness of the 3D free-boundary incompressible elastodynamics with surface tension describing the motion of an elastic medium in a periodic domain with a moving graphical surface. The deformation tensor is assumed to satisfy the neo-Hookean linear elasticity. We adapt the idea in arXiv:2312.11254 to generate an approximate problem with artificial viscosity indexed by $\kappa &gt; 0$ to boost the boundary regularity, which recovers the original system as $\kappa\to 0$, and the energy estimates yield no regularity loss.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness and smoothing effect for spatially homogeneous Landau-Coulomb equation in $H^{-\f12}$ space with polynomial tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spatially homogeneous Landau-Coulomb equation exhibits global existence and uniqueness around the space $H^{-\f12}_3\cap L^1_{7}\cap L\log L$. Additionally, we furnish several quantitative assessments regarding the smoothing estimates in weighted Sobolev spaces. Consequently, we confirm the conjecture that the solution possesses a $C^\infty$ smoothing effect in velocity variable for any positive time, similar to the heat equation, despite the initial data having only a polynomial tail.</description>

      <title>Optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the Dirac equation in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give optimal constants of smoothing estimates for the $d$-dimensional free Dirac equation for any $d \geq 2$. Our main abstract theorem shows that the optimal constant $C$ of smoothing estimate associated with a spatial weight $w$ and smoothing function $\psi$ is given by $(2\pi)^{d-1} C = \sup_{k \in \mathbb{N}} \sup_{r &gt; 0} \widetilde{\lambda}_k(r)$, where $\{ \widetilde{\lambda}_k \}$ is a certain sequence of functions defined via integral formulae involving $(w, \psi)$. This is an analogue of a similar result for Schr\"{o}dinger equations given by Bez--Saito--Sugimoto (2015), and also extends previous results of Ikoma (2022) and Ikoma--Suzuki (2024) for $d=2, 3$ to any dimensions $d \geq 2$. In order to prove this, we establish a modified version of the spherical harmonics decomposition of $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, which suits well with the Dirac operator and allows us to find optimal constants. Furthermore, using our abstract theorem, we give explicit values of optimal constants associated with typical examples of $(w, \psi)$. As it turns out, optimal constants for Dirac equations can be written explicitly in many cases, even in the cases that it is impossible for Schr\"{o}dinger equations.</description>

      <title>On the local Maxwellians solving the Boltzmann equation with boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the expressions of the local Maxwellians that solve the Boltzmann equation in the interior of an open domain. We determine which of these local Maxwellians satisfy the Boltzmann equation in a regular domain with boundary, without assuming the boundedness of the domain. We investigate separately, on the one hand, the case of the bounce-back boundary condition in any dimension, and on the other hand the case of the specular reflection boundary condition, in dimension $d = 2$ and $d = 3$. In the case of the bounce-back boundary condition, we prove that the only local Maxwellians solving the Boltzmann equation with boundary condition are the global Maxwellians. In the case of the specular reflection, we provide a complete classification of the domains for which only the global Maxwellians solve the Boltzmann equation with boundary condition, and we describe all the local Maxwellians that solve the equation for the domains presenting symmetries.</description>

      <title>Decay of mass for a semilinear heat equation with mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the Cauchy problem for the reaction-diffusion equation $\partial_t u+t^\beta\mathcal{L} u= - h(t)u^p$ posed on $\mathbb{R}^N$, driven by the mixed local-nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}=-\Delta+(-\Delta)^{\alpha/2}$, $\alpha\in(0,2)$, and supplemented with a nonnegative integrable initial data, where $p&gt;1$, $\beta\geq 0$, and $h:(0,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is a locally integrable function. We study the large time behavior of non-negative solutions and show that the nonlinear term determines the large time asymptotic for $p\leq 1+{\alpha}/{N(\beta+1)},$ while the classical/anomalous diffusion effects win if $p&gt;1+{\alpha}/{N(\beta+1)}$.</description>

      <title>Policy Iteration for Exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the policy iteration algorithm (PIA) for entropy-regularized stochastic control problems on an infinite time horizon with a large discount rate, focusing on two main scenarios. First, we analyze PIA with bounded coefficients where the controls applied to the diffusion term satisfy a smallness condition. We demonstrate the convergence of PIA based on a uniform $\mathcal{C}^{2,\alpha}$ estimate for the value sequence generated by PIA, and provide a quantitative convergence analysis for this scenario. Second, we investigate PIA with unbounded coefficients but no control over the diffusion term. In this scenario, we first provide the well-posedness of the exploratory Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation with linear growth coefficients and polynomial growth reward function. By such a well-posedess result we achieve PIA's convergence by establishing a quantitative locally uniform $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ estimates for the generated value sequence.</description>

      <title>Exciting games and Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a competition between $d+1$ players, and aim to identify the "most exciting game'' of this kind. This is translated, mathematically, into a stochastic optimization problem over martingales that live on the $d$-dimensional subprobability simplex $\Delta$ and terminate on the vertices of $\Delta$ (so-called win-martingales), with a cost function related to a scaling limit of Shannon entropies. We uncover a surprising connection between this problem and the seemingly unrelated field of Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations: If $g$ solves \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} g(x)=\log \det\left(\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2 g(x)\right), \quad \, \ \ \ \ \, \, \, \, x \in \Delta, \\ g(x)=\infty, \quad \quad \quad \quad \ \ \ \ \ \quad \quad \, \ \ \ \ \ x\in \partial \Delta, \end{cases} \end{equation*} then the winning-probability of the players in the most exciting game is described by $$dM_s=\sqrt{\frac{2 (\nabla^2 g(M_s))^{-1}}{1-s} } \, dB_s.$$ To formalize this, a detailed quantitative analysis of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation for $g$ is crucial. This is then leveraged to prove that $M$ is indeed an optimal win-martingale.</description>
