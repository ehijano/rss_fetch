      <title>Cloaking Cosmic Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light crossing dark domain walls that source a top form coupled to gauge Chern--Simons terms mixing visible and dark $U(1)$ gauge fields generically converts into dark photons. The effect is entirely localized on the wall and requires no additional ingredients. The conversion rate is a sharp function of the photon frequency in the wall rest frame, vanishing above the ultraviolet cutoff of the top form sector. Partial cloaking may also induce a rotation of the polarization of transmitted light of order $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3}$ radians, modify the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, and violate Etherington's reciprocity relation at low frequencies. These effects can impact cosmological determinations of the Hubble rate.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in Quintessential Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quintessential inflation provides a unified description of the early and late accelerated phases of the Universe, linking the inflationary epoch to the present-day dark energy-dominated era through a single scalar degree of freedom. In this work, we explore the implications of this unification for cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses. Focusing on the $\alpha$-attractor scenario, we implement the model in a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS to compute the relevant cosmological observables and perform a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and Type Ia supernovae. The model naturally breaks the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the total neutrino mass, yielding tight upper bounds of $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.067$ eV for flat spatial geometry and $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.116$ eV when curvature is included. We also provide forecasts for future probes, showing that the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD, and Euclid configurations may reduce the uncertainty on $\sum m_\nu$ by $\approx 9\%$, while the precision on the quintessential parameter $\alpha_{QI}$ is improved by $\approx 72\%$. These results highlight the importance of consistently accounting for neutrino mass when assessing the viability of extensions to the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>IR-Safe and IR-Resummed Bispectra Before and After Reconstruction in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified analytic framework for modeling the real-space dark matter bispectrum, including both auto and cross bispectra constructed from pre- and post-reconstruction density fields, based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT reorganizes the standard Lagrangian approach by separating the Jacobian deviation, which generates the nonlinear source bispectrum, from the displacement-mapping effect that determines how long-wavelength bulk flows distort observed configurations. Within this structure, we derive general one-loop ULPT expressions for the bispectrum and analyze their infrared (IR) behavior, demonstrating exact, nonperturbative IR cancellation and the natural emergence of an IR-resummed description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping. In particular, ULPT enables a detailed and fully analytic treatment of the wiggle-wiggle contribution to the IR-resummed bispectrum, whose structure has remained comparatively unexplored in previous approaches. We further construct IR-resummed models for the cross bispectra of all pre- and post-reconstruction combinations. For configurations in which the displacement fields differ, ULPT captures not only the overall exponential damping but also the more intricate BAO-scale modulation characteristic of mixed pre/post bispectra. Our results clarify the physical origin of nonlinear BAO suppression and provide a compact theoretical framework in which the full ULPT bispectrum, once implemented numerically through displacement-mapping convolution integrals, will automatically encode all nonlinear BAO and IR effects. The framework developed here therefore offers a unified and IR-safe foundation for interpreting next-generation bispectrum measurements.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning cosmological parameters by eROSITA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: We present the first Cosmological Parameter inferences from eROSITA X-ray observations of galaxy clusters using a Machine Learning algorithm. Methods: We train a Random Forest using mock catalogs of clusters from Magneticum multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations. We apply the trained ML algorithm to observed X-ray features (gas luminosity, mass, and temperature) at different redshifts from the eROSITA eFEDS and eRASS1 catalogs. Results: We obtain cosmological constraints with precision comparable to those from standard analyses, such as weak lensing and cluster abundances. We infer $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.30^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$, $\sigma_8=0.81\pm0.01$, and $h_0=0.710\pm0.004$. The recovered parameters show no tension in the $\Omega_{\rm m}-\sigma_8$ space, but a significant deviation of $h_0$ from the Planck estimates. These inferences remain rather stable against variations of the input observable set and parameter space coverage. These results indicate that correlations among intracluster properties contain cosmological information beyond that encoded in the cluster abundance alone, which can be captured by machine learning trained on multi-cosmology simulations. Conclusions: ML algorithms trained on multi-cosmology hydrodynamical simulations can effectively infer cosmological parameters directly from galaxy cluster data. This is a change of paradigm in the context of cosmological parameter inferences. This approach complements traditional cluster-count analyses and is particularly suited to large upcoming surveys, where systematic uncertainties in mass calibration may otherwise dominate the error budget. It also highlights the potential of large-scale X-ray surveys to deliver independent tests of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the Lyth Bound with Entangled Gravitons: Primordial Signatures and Late-Time Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum entanglement between primordial gravitons in dynamically decoupled gravitational sectors can parametrically enhance the tensor power spectrum during inflation. Unlike standard mechanisms relying on classical dynamics or modified actions, this enhancement originates from the reduced density matrix of the observable sector after tracing over a hidden gravitational reservoir. This framework allows for a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio r &gt; 0.01 consistent with sub-Planckian inflaton excursions, providing a purely quantum mechanical evasion of the Lyth bound. The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive "quantum birthmark" in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum. Furthermore, we forecast that this entanglement may manifest as a late-time stochastic noise enhancement in gravitational wave interferometers, offering a novel experimental window into the quantum nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical cosmological simulations with StePS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global topology of the Universe can affect the long-range gravitational forces through the boundary conditions. To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\mathrm{S}^1\times\mathbb{R}^2$ ("slab") topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters. The cylindrical domain's topology enables fully self-consistent simulations in the $\mathrm{S}^1\times\mathbb{R}^2$ manifold and mitigates periodic-image artefacts for targets whose symmetries are mismatched to a cubic box. The main trade-off is radially varying resolution with distinct systematics and analysis requirements. We demonstrate the accuracy of the new simulation method in a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on CMBR flux due to high-z dust emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gjergo &amp; Kroupa (2025) have proposed a new foreground CMBR component produced by dust associated with the progenitor clouds at $z=15-20$ that led to the formation of massive early-type galaxies, calculating that a minimum of 1.4% and a maximum of 100% of the whole CMBR radiation would be produced by this mechanism. Here, I check how much dust emission is compatible with the spectrum of the CMBR monopole flux measurements within the corresponding errors. COBE-FIRAS monopole is fitted to different models with different dust emissivity spectral indexes ($\beta $) and dispersion of redshifts of the progenitor clouds ($\sigma _d$). Within the realistic values of $\beta \ge 0.5$, $\sigma _d\ge 0.8$, the contamination of CMBR flux by high $z$ dust should be $&lt;1.3$% (95% CL).</description>

      <title>Simulations of the 21cm emission line for upcoming large-scale HI galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys with the SKA Observatory will detect neutral hydrogen (HI) across unprecedented volumes, and their scientific return will crucially depend on predictive models for HI observables. In this work, we present a framework to simulate the neutral hydrogen 21cm emission line in such large-scale HI galaxy surveys. This framework is developed as a modular layer that builds on semi-analytical models. In particular we use as bases the Galaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) and L-Galaxies semi-analytical models, coupled to merger trees from the Millennium Simulation suite. We validate our framework against local Universe observations, demonstrating consistency with velocity functions, and generalised Tully-Fisher relations. Predictions based on GAEA and L-Galaxies exhibit mutual consistency despite the distinct underlying physical prescriptions. We construct mock galaxy catalogues that incorporate forward-modelled selection functions, inclination effects, and redshift broadening, reproducing the statistical distributions of HI-selected galaxies in the ALFALFA survey. Finally, we present redshift distribution forecasts for future SKA Observatory HI galaxy surveys. This framework offers a flexible tool for interpreting upcoming large-scale radio surveys and studying HI line observables as cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting CPL with sign-switching density: to cross or not to cross the NECB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 BAO measurements, when combined with CMB and SNeIa data, exhibit a $3.2\sigma$-$3.4\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) described by the CPL-parametrized equation of state. A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $\rho_{\rm DE}+p_{\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\to-\Lambda$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Physical Predictions in Closed Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in gravitational path integrals indicate that the nonperturbative physical Hilbert space of a closed universe is one-dimensional within each superselection sector. This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability -- reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe -- suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle--Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.</description>

      <title>Linking Leptogenesis and Asymmetric Dark Matter: A Testable Framework for Neutrino Mass and the Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal extension of the Leptogenesis framework that simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance through the decay of a heavy Majorana neutrino. In this scenario, CP violation arises from complex Yukawa couplings, enabling the generation of asymmetries in both the Standard Model (SM) and DM sectors. We explore two regimes: (i) wash-in, where an initial dark asymmetry is transferred to SM leptons by $2 \leftrightarrow 2$ scattering processes; and (ii) co-genesis, featuring a hierarchical coupling structure that allows enhanced CP violation while supporting a low-scale seesaw mechanism at order $\mathcal{O}(2)$ TeV. This setup not only links light neutrino masses to the Majorana mass term but also suggests that lepton-number violation may occur at experimentally accessible energy scales. In the co-genesis scenario, we show spin-independent cross sections for DM heavier than 10 GeV that can be tested in current direct detection experiments and motivate the exploration of cross sections inside the neutrino fog for lighter DM masses, establishing asymmetric leptogenesis as a predictive benchmark framework for direct-detection experiments and identifying a new hierarchical-coupling regime enabling TeV-scale leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Unitarity violation and restoration in radiative bound-state formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art calculations motivated by dark matter exhibit severe violation of partial-wave unitarity in the non-relativistic regime in radiative bound-state-formation processes. It has been recently shown, in a model-independent fashion, that unitarity is restored by the proper resummation of the inelastic contributions to the self-energy of the incoming state. In this work, we first derive Kramers-like formulae for individual partial waves, demonstrating that existing calculations of bound-state formation severely violate unitarity. We then discuss how unitarity is restored through the resummation of the absorptive contributions to the incoming-state self-energy, generated by bound-state formation processes, taking into account their analytic structure in the complex momentum plane. Our results can be generalized in a variety of theories and employed in phenomenological studies, such as dark-matter freeze-out, indirect detection and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess from a Generic Triaxial Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of Galactic surveys, such as Gaia, have revealed that the Milky Way's gravitational potential comes from a matter distribution that is triaxial and rotated with respect to the Galactic center-Sun axis. This, in turn, could mean that the dark matter halo also shares these properties. In this work, by fitting to the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, we test the compatibility of the morphology of the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) from dark matter annihilation with a triaxial dark matter halo. In particular, we consider both untilted triaxial halos and halos whose principal axes are tilted with respect to the Galactic disk. In our fits of the Fermi-LAT data, by testing over a large library of galactic diffuse emission models, we quantify how the halo triaxiality and tilt affect the line-of-sight-integrated annihilation signal and, consequently, the preferred GCE spatial templates. We find that the GCE spectrum and inner cuspiness are robust against variations in the triaxiality and tilt of the dark matter halo. However, in terms of its overall morphology, the GCE in the gamma-ray data can discriminate between choices for the dark matter halo's triaxiality and tilt. Finally, we find that the GCE is more compatible with originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of dark matter than originating from a triaxial and tilted halo of stars, a result important for understanding the GCE's origin.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Cosmic-Ray Scatterings on Relic Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray scatterings on the cosmic neutrino background induce a flux of gamma-rays and X-rays from boosted meson decays and charged lepton processes. Here we present the first estimate of this flux and its cumulative cosmological contribution. Confronting expectations with Fermi-LAT diffuse gamma-ray data, we find a limit on the cosmic neutrino background overdensity at the level of $\eta \lesssim 2 \times 10^{4}$ for a lightest neutrino mass of $m_{\nu}\gtrsim0.1$ eV, orders of magnitude stronger than current direct laboratory probes, and comparable to constraints on the cosmic neutrino background obtained with IceCube. We further show that X-ray synchrotron emission from cascade electron-positron pairs in intergalactic magnetic fields provides a complementary, albeit weaker, constraint. We discuss how anisotropic signatures and future gamma-ray data from CTA could further improve bounds on the relic neutrino overdensity, approaching in sensitivity the $\Lambda$CDM expected density.</description>

      <title>The First Systematic Survey of Stellar Halos in High-Inclination Galaxies Reveals Unusually Quiescent Merger Histories of Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar halos are the only major stellar component of disk galaxies that lack systematic observational characterization, yet they encode critical information about galaxy merger histories. We present the first systematic census of stellar halos in a large, flux-limited sample of 169 high-inclination central galaxies with stellar masses 7.3 &lt;= log Mstar/Msun &lt;= 11.0 and redshift z &lt; 0.1, using HSC-SSP Deep optical images. Stellar halos are detected in 93 galaxies, primarily through their low isophotal ellipticities in the outskirts, improving upon conventional methods of stellar halo identification. The halo detection rate reaches ~ 50% at log Mstar/Msun &gt; 9.9 and &gt;= 70% for Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies. We derive halo surface brightness profiles, colors, and masses, finding that stellar halos generally follow power-law radial profiles. Higher-mass galaxies, on average, exhibit smaller power-law indices and larger halo mass fractions, indicating more extended halos and more active merger histories. A significant stellar halo color-mass correlation, driven mainly by the mass-metallicity relation, suggests dominance by a few massive accretion events. MW-mass galaxies have a median stellar halo fraction of 10% +/- 5%. Among nearby galaxies with halo measurements within 25 Mpc, two thirds (including the MW) lie below the mean stellar halo fraction-galaxy mass relation. Overall, the nearby galaxies show a median halo deficit of ~ 0.3 dex, implying unusually quiescent merger histories. We show that this deficit follows a broader trend in which typical halo fractions increase with heliocentric distance, tracking the gradual rise in matter density toward the cosmic average by z &lt;= 0.07.</description>

      <title>BASS LVI. Connecting X-ray variability with AGN physical properties and a new path to Cosmological distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray variability is a well-established characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known to correlate inversely with both the supermassive black hole mass and luminosity, although the degree of each remains a topic of debate. The potential of X-ray variability as a proxy for MBH or for intrinsic LX has led to proposals to use AGN as standard candles to test cosmological models. However, the large intrinsic dispersion in these relations has limited their practical applications. In this work, we investigate the dependence of X-ray variability on AGN physical properties using a sample of 134 Seyfert 1 galaxies from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), which is the largest sample to date, more than three times larger than those used in previous studies. Contrary to earlier findings, we observe that X-ray variability correlates with luminosity just as strongly as with MBH. Furthermore, we still do not find evidence for the expected anti-correlation between variability and Eddington ratio, even when using refined bolometric luminosities from SED fitting to compute the Eddington ratio. From a cosmological perspective, the increased sample size reduces the scatter in the log(L)-log(exvar) relation to ~0.63 dex - a significant improvement over previous results, but still too large to serve as competitive standard candles, when compared to SNIa (uncertainties on distances of ~5-10%) or the L(X)-L(UV) relation in quasars (uncertainties of 10-12%). We tested including the width of broad emission lines as additional parameters, but found that this does not significantly lower the observed dispersion, contrary to previous studies on smaller samples. Finally, we discuss how future X-ray missions such as AXIS and NewAthena will improve this scenario by enabling precise variability measurements for thousands of AGN up to redshift z~3, thereby enabling it as a new cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Complex Inflaton Potentials with Nonminimal Coupling: Robust Inflation and Geometric Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an inflationary scenario driven by a complex scalar field nonminimally coupled to gravity and subject to a non-symmetric complex potential. The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $\alpha$-attractor $\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $\zeta$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $\Delta\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $\Delta\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range. Mapping the two-field dynamics to an effective single-field description in the Einstein frame, we obtain a spectral index $n_s\simeq 0.968-0.971$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&lt;10^{-3}$, fully consistent with Planck 2018 bounds. We introduce a relevance parameter and show that non-Hermitian effects remain strongly suppressed during slow roll but grow to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ near the end of inflation, triggering an efficient reheating phase without additional fields or {\it ad hoc} friction terms. In this sense, the imaginary sector behaves as an effective $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric channel for energy transfer, providing a geometrical mechanism for inflation and its exit within a non-Hermitian scalar-tensor framework.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Selection of High-Redshift Emission-Line Galaxies for future DESI-like surveys with Deep Multi-band Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emission-line galaxies (ELGs) are an important tracer of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and large-scale structure (LSS) at $z &gt; 1$. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using deep wide-area multi-band imaging (e.g., from the Rubin Observatory) to efficiently select high redshift ELGs. Using Hyper Supreme-Cam $grizy$ photometry and COSMOS2020 many-band photometric redshifts, we designed simple color cuts guided by a probabilistic random forest classifier to select galaxies at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$. We then empirically tested and refined these color cuts using two samples of galaxies with deep spectroscopy and broad color coverage obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Compared to DESI ELGs at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$, we achieve a higher redshift measurement success rate (89% versus 69%), a much higher correct redshift range success rate (84% versus 34%), and a far higher net surface density yield (1372 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$ versus 660 $\mathrm{deg^{-2}}$). Combining our sample with current DESI ELGs would increase the net ELG number density by a factor of $\sim3$, moving it out of the shot-noise limited regime and reducing the uncertainties on the BAO scale parameter at $z = 1.1$--$1.6$ by a factor of $\sim 2$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Gravity with Non-Extensive Horizon Entropy and Topological Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of gravitational dynamics in the presence of generalized, non-extensive horizon entropies. Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity.
  Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = \eta (A/4G)^\delta$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(\chi) \propto |\chi|^{1-\delta}$ where $\chi$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-\delta|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the cosmic web: the relative impact of nodes and filaments in the EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve within the intricate geometry of the cosmic web, yet the distinct roles of its primary components - nodes and filaments remain incompletely understood. Using the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, we investigate how distances to filament spines and cluster-scale nodes jointly and independently influence galaxy evolution. Galaxies are classified into red, green, and blue populations through a fully data-driven entropic thresholding technique, and the nodes and filaments are identified using DisPerSE. We find that red galaxies preferentially reside near filament cores and nodes, whereas blue galaxies dominate the outskirts. This spatial segregation reveals two characteristic transition scales: a node-related crossover at $\sim 2.5~\mathrm{Mpc}$ and a filament-related crossover at $\sim 0.75~\mathrm{Mpc}$. To further quantify environmental influence, we adopt an information-theoretic approach and measure the normalised mutual information between dominant mass component and galaxy colour across the $d_{\mathrm{f}}$-$d_{\mathrm{n}}$ plane. The mass-colour coupling increases with distance from nodes at fixed filament proximity, indicating a weakening of this relation in cluster-scale environments and a stronger coupling within filamentary regions. This behaviour is strongly mass dependent, with low-mass galaxies exhibiting a more pronounced environmental modulation than high-mass systems. These results support a scale-dependent view of galaxy evolution across the cosmic web, highlighting the distinct and complementary influence of nodes and filaments.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study of nearby starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of the nearby starburst galaxy M 82 by combining high-resolution Far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging from the Ultra-Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat and archival Chandra X-ray observations. Using FUV flux measurements, we estimate a spatially-resolved star formation rate (SFR) across several star-forming clumps within a radius of $\sim$3.6 kpc, finding a total SFR of 0.022 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The H$_{\alpha}$ recombination line flux yields an SFR of $\sim$0.010 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the infrared-based SFR derived from 24 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ emission is significantly higher at 16 - 18 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggesting that a substantial fraction of star formation in M 82 is heavily dust-obscured. Morphological comparison of FUV, H$_{\alpha}$, mid-infrared, and soft X-ray emission reveals a strong spatial correlation, tracing multi-phase outflows along the galaxy's minor axis. X-ray spectral analysis using a three-temperature $\texttt{VAPEC}$ model shows enhanced abundances of Ne, Mg, Si, and S, consistent with enrichment from Type-II supernovae. These results demonstrate the importance of combining UV, optical, IR, and X-ray observations to probe both obscured and unobscured star formation, the metal enrichment, and the outflow-driven evolution of starburst galaxies.</description>

      <title>A Salpeter IMF and an NFW halo: Disentangling the dark and stellar mass through precise lens modelling of a double-source-plane system reinforces the canonical model of elliptical galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a strong lensing analysis of the double source plane lens J0946+1006 (colloquially "Jackpot" lens) to measure the inner dark matter density profile, the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and the stellar initial mass function normalisation using a two component stellar plus dark matter mass model. The stellar mass follows a multi-Gaussian expansion light model with a free global mass-to-light ratio and an allowed radial $M/L$ gradient, while the dark matter is described by an elliptical generalised NFW halo. The double-source-plane geometry provides additional leverage against the mass-sheet transformation and helps constrain the radial mass profile. Despite allowing both a radial stellar $M/L$ gradient and a generalised NFW halo, the data prefer the canonical picture: an approximately constant stellar mass-to-light ratio with a Salpeter-like IMF normalisation, and a dark matter halo consistent with NFW. We infer $M_{\star} = 4.4^{+0.25}_{-0.39}\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ and an inner halo slope $\gamma_{\rm in}^{\rm halo} = 1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.14}$. The halo mass is $M_{200}^{\rm halo} = 1.11^{+0.37}_{-0.32}\times 10^{13}\,M_{\odot}$, implying $\log_{10}(M_{200}/M_{\star})=1.41^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. At fixed halo mass, the inferred stellar mass lies $\sim0.1$ dex above typical literature stellar halo mass relations at similar redshift, which is comparable to the intrinsic scatter of these relations. We expect this approach to provide a practical template for future dark matter studies with the large double-source-plane lens samples from Euclid.</description>

      <title>The Magnetic Filling in MAD Simulations and its Impact on the Jet in M87</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetically arrested accretion disks (MADs) in black hole jet launching simulations are very successful in modelling low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) like M87*. The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Bayesian Tension Statistics using Neural Ratio Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When fits of the same physical model to two different datasets disagree, we call this tension. Several apparent tensions in cosmology have occupied researchers in recent years, and a number of different metrics have been proposed to quantify tension. Many of these metrics suffer from limiting assumptions, and correctly calibrating these is essential if we want to successfully determine whether discrepancies are significant. A commonly used metric of tension is the evidence ratio R. The statistic has been widely adopted by the community as a Bayesian way of quantifying tensions, however, it has a non-trivial dependence on the prior that is not always accounted for properly. We show that this can be calibrated out effectively with Neural Ratio Estimation. We demonstrate our proposed calibration technique with an analytic example, a toy example inspired by 21-cm cosmology, and with observations of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find no significant tension between DESI and SDSS.</description>

      <title>Cool-Core Destruction in Merging Clusters with AGN Feedback and Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) dichotomy of galaxy clusters remains uncertain. Previous simulations have found that cluster mergers are effective in destroying CCs but fail to prevent overcooling in cluster cores when radiative cooling is included. Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however, the role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work, we perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating AGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects from mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction. We vary the mass ratio and impact parameter to examine the entropy evolution of different merger scenarios. We find that AGN feedback is essential in regulating the merging clusters, and that CC destruction depends on the merger parameters. Our results suggest three scenarios regarding CC/NCC transitions: (1) CCs are preserved in minor mergers or mergers that do not trigger sufficient heating, in which cases AGN feedback is crucial for preventing the cooling catastrophe; (2) CCs are transformed into NCCs by major mergers during the first core passage, and AGN feedback is subdominant; (3) in major mergers with a large impact parameter, mergers and AGN feedback operate in concert to destroy the CCs.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Quantifying the impact of beam chromaticity on large-scale B-mode science</title>

Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO) Small Aperture Telescopes (SATs) will observe the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization at six frequency bands. Within these bands, the angular response of the telescope (beam) is convolved with the instrument's spectral response (commonly called bandpass) and the signal from the sky, which leads to the band-averaged telescope beam response, which is sampled and digitized. The spectral properties of the band-averaged beam depend on the natural variation of the beam within the band, referred to as beam chromaticity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the interplay of beam chromaticity and intrinsic frequency scaling from the various components that dominate the polarized sky emission on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and foreground parameters. We do so by employing a parametric power-spectrum-based foreground component separation algorithm, namely BBPower, to which we provide beam-convolved time domain simulations performed with the beamconv software while assuming an idealized version of the SO SAT optics. We find a small, $0.02\sigma$, bias on $r$, due to beam chromaticity, which seems to mostly impact the dust spatial parameters, causing a maximum $0.77 \sigma$ bias on the dust $B$-mode spectra amplitude, $A_{d}$, when employing Gaussian foreground simulations. However, we find all parameter biases to be smaller than $1\sigma$ at all times, independently of the foreground model. This includes the case where we introduce additional uncertainty on the bandpass shape, which accounts for approximately half of the total allowed gain uncertainty, as estimated in previous work for the SO SATs.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of posterior recovery with neural network emulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural network emulators are widely used in astrophysics and cosmology to approximate complex simulations inside Bayesian inference loops. Ad hoc rules of thumb are often used to justify the emulator accuracy required for reliable posterior recovery. We provide a theoretically motivated limit on the maximum amount of incorrect information inferred by using an emulator with a given accuracy. Under assumptions of linearity in the model, uncorrelated noise in the data and a Gaussian likelihood function, we demonstrate that the difference between the true underlying posterior and the recovered posterior can be quantified via a Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate how this limit can be used in the field of 21-cm cosmology by comparing the posteriors recovered when fitting mock data sets generated with the 1D radiative transfer code ARES directly with the simulation code and separately with an emulator. This paper is partly in response to and builds upon recent discussions in the literature which call into question the use of emulators in Bayesian inference pipelines. Upon repeating some aspects of these analyses, we find these concerns quantitatively unjustified, with accurate posterior recovery possible even when the mean RMSE error for the emulator is approximately 20% of the magnitude of the noise in the data. For the purposes of community reproducibility, we make our analysis code public at this link https://github.com/htjb/validating_posteriors.</description>

      <title>Dispu$\tau$able: the high cost of a low optical depth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) are mildly discrepant ($2.2\sigma$) with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within $\Lambda$CDM. When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\simeq3\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\tau$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($\tau\sim0.09)$ reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\simeq3\sigma$ to $\simeq1.5\sigma$ and increase the CMB-inferred values of $n_s$ and $H_0$ to $0.968\pm0.004$ and $67.94\pm0.44$ km/s/Mpc, respectively. Conversely, within $\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $\tau = 0.090 \pm 0.012$, which is in $\simeq3-5\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. Essentially all current CMB analyses $-$ including recent results from WMAP+ACT and SPT $-$ adopt the Planck measurement of $\tau$: thus a systematic in large-scale Planck polarization would serve as a "single-point failure" for most modern cosmological analyses that include CMB data. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\Lambda$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit. This strengthens the case for future large-scale CMB experiments as well as direct probes of the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</description>

      <title>Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $\Lambda$CDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation at High Redshifts from Multiband of GRBs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the gravity quantum theory, the quantization of spacetime may lead to the modification of the dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum and the Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). High energy and long-distance gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) observations in the universe provide a unique opportunity to test the possibility of LIV. In this work, we use 88 time delays from GRBs ($0.117 &lt; z &lt; 6.29$), and provide a cosmological model-independent approach based on the luminosity distance data from 174 GRBs to test LIV. Combining the observation data from multiband of GRBs provides us with an opportunity to mitigate the potential systematic errors arising from variations in the physical characteristics among diverse object populations, and to add a higher redshift dataset for testing the energy-dependent velocity caused by the corrected dispersion relationship of photons. These robust limits of the energy scale for the linear and quadratic LIV effects are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1} \ge 1.5\times 10^{15}$ GeV, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2} \ge 8.5\times 10^{9}$ GeV, respectively. It exhibits a significantly reduced value compared to the energy scale of Planck in both scenarios of linear and quadratic LIV.</description>

      <title>A Detection of Circumgalactic Dust at Megaparsec Scales with Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the more surprising astrophysical discoveries of the last decade has been the presence of enormous quantities of dust at megaparsec distances from galaxies, which has important implications for galaxy evolution, the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, and observational cosmology. In this work, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic dust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background galaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric data and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it applicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the redMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion in color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting extinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and redMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction profiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with noticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies: star-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner 50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent galaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out to 30 megaparsecs. We test the robustness of our results using star catalogs and inverted foreground and background samples and find no evidence for significant systematic error. Our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the interplay between circumgalactic dust, galaxy evolution, and large-scale structure, with potential applications in a number of astrophysical subfields.</description>

      <title>Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons. The first solution applies when the new axion forms strings after inflation. Due to its mixing with the QCD axion, domain walls of the QCD axion are bounded by these strings and confined into cosmologically safe string bundles. This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced. We identify the viable parameter regions and discuss the resulting dark matter abundance.</description>

Abstract: We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.</description>

      <title>Probing cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of long-rising type II supernovae -- Bayesian analytic modeling and spectrophotometric correlations</title>

Abstract: Supernova (SN) 1987A, with its long-rising ($\gtrsim$40 days) light curve, defines a rare subclass of type II SNe known as 1987A-like events. Representing only 1-3 percent of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of scalar-tensor theories and scale-dependent gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel equivalence between scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories that have only a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term in the Einstein frame and a conformal coupling to the metric tensor. In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent gravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique way. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a scale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of the actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context of this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to a dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic term in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new equivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the aforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence relations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>GraviBERT: Transformer-based inference for gravitational-wave time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GraviBERT, a novel deep learning framework for gravitational wave inference, built on a multi-scale feature extractor with a transformer encoder and a suitable regression head. A key novelty of GraviBERT is its staged training: a BERT-style self-supervised pretraining phase to learn transferable representations, followed by supervised fine-tuning on labeled data. GraviBERT demonstrates consistent transfer learning across detector configurations and waveform models. On in-domain data, pretraining reduces the MAE by up to $31\%$ and accelerates convergence by $\sim 6.6 \times$, with mean relative precision for point estimates reaching the few-percent level and MAE in effective spin of $\sim 10^{-3}$ at SNR = 10. For domain adaptation to new detector noise profiles, the pretrained model converges up to $15\times$ faster on small target datasets and reduces estimation errors by up to $\sim 47\%$, demonstrating detector-agnostic learning. Cross-waveform approximant transfer achieves up to $44\%$ MAE reductions and up to $15\times$ training speedups, with $R^2$ scores consistently exceeding $0.9$ for mass parameters at SNR = 10 compared to $0.74$ - $0.87$ when training from scratch. GraviBERT works directly with noisy waveforms, and in its current form quantifies predictive uncertainty through MC dropouts. After pretraining, the regression head could be adapted to multiple downstream inference tasks in gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>
