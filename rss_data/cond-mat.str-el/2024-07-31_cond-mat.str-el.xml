      <title>Validating Mean Field Theory in a New Complex, Disordered High-Entropy Spinel Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of novel high-entropy oxides has sparked substantial research interest due to their exceptional functional properties, which often surpass the mere sum of their constituent elements' characteristics. This study introduces a complex high-entropy spinel oxide with composition (Ni$_{0.2}$Mg$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)(Mn$_{0.66}$Fe$_{0.66}$Cr$_{0.66}$)O$_{4}$. We performed comprehensive structural (X-ray and Neutron diffraction), microstructural, magnetic, and local electronic structure investigations on this material. Despite the material's high degree of disorder, detailed magnetization measurements and low temperature neutron powder diffraction studies reveal long-range ferrimagnetic ordering beginning at 293 K. The sample exhibits a high saturation magnetization of 766 emu-cm${^3}$ (at 50 K), a low coercivity (H$_C$) of 100 Oe (50 K), a high transition temperature (T$_C$) around room temperature, and high resistivity value of 4000 Ohm-cm at room temperature, indicating its potential for high density memory devices. The magnetic structure is determined using a collinear-type ferrimagnetic model with a propagation vector k = 0,0,0. Various analytical techniques, including modified Arrott plots, Kouvel-Fischer analysis, and critical isotherm analysis, are employed to investigate the phase transitions and magnetic properties of this complex system. Our results indicate a second-order phase transition. Remarkably, despite the complex structure and significant disorder, the critical exponents obtained are consistent with the mean field model. The high entropy leads to a remarkably homogeneous distribution of multiple cations, validating the approximation of average local magnetic environments and supporting the mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ordering of the Mo$_3$O$_8$-type cluster Mott insulator Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ with spin-1/2 triangular lattice prepared via optimal synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We detail the optimized synthesis of the Mo$_3$O$_8$-type cluster Mott insulator (CMI) Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, which has been considered a candidate for realizing the spin liquid ground state. The optimized Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, characterized by x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and magnetic and heat capacity measurements, exhibited an effective magnetic moment close to the ideal 1.73 $\mu_{\mathrm B}$ for $S = 1/2$ spin and magnetic ordering at $\sim$ 5 K. These observations categorize Na$_3$Sc$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$ as the second Mo$_3$O$_8$-type CMI to achieve a magnetic ground state, following Li$_2$InMo$_3$O$_8$. They highlight the stabilization of the magnetic ground state over the theoretically anticipated quantum spin liquid state through precise valence and chemical disorder tuning. Our findings challenge the existing theory that the magnetic ground state of Mo$_3$O$_8$-type CMIs is determined by the breathing parameter, instead showing that magnetic order is suppressed by spin defects. This study underscores the crucial role of chemical precision in investigating quantum magnetism. It suggests that precise tuning of valence states could induce magnetic ordering in previously nonmagnetic Mo$_3$O$_8$-type CMIs. Additionally, the negative findings regarding the existence of quantum spin liquids highlight the need for applied research and a reevaluation of our fundamental understanding of electronic states from both theoretical and experimental aspects.</description>

      <title>Magnon Spectra of Cuprates beyond Spin Wave Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The usual starting point for understanding magnons in cuprate antiferromagnets such as La$_2$CuO$_4$ is a spin model incorporating cyclic exchange, which descends from a one-band Hubbard model, and has parameters taken from fits based on non-interacting spin wave theory. Here we explore whether this provides a reliable description of experiment, using matrix product states (MPS) to calculate magnon spectra beyond spin wave theory. We find that analysis based on low orders of spin wave theory leads to systematic overestimates of exchange parameters, with corresponding errors in estimates of Hubbard $t/U$. Once these are corrected, the ''standard'' model provides a good account of magnon dispersion and lineshape in La$_2$CuO$_4$, but fails to fully capture the continuum observed at high energies. The extension of this analysis to CaCuO$_2$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spinon quantum spin Hall state in the kagome antiferromagnet with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on kagome lattice, making use of the variational Monte Carlo technique. An exotic quantum spin state is found to arise from a melting of the $\boldsymbol{Q} = 0$ long-range magnetic order by a topological transition, when a small anisotropic third nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction is turned on. This novel state is a gapped quantum spin liquid, characterized by a topological order with ground-state degeneracy $n_g = 4$ and topological entanglement entropy $\gamma = \ln 2$, suggesting it is an Abelian topological phase. Furthermore, the Chern numbers of the spin-up (-down) spinon occupied bands of this state are $C_{\uparrow \downarrow} = \pm 1$, respectively. From this perspective, this state is also a time-reversal symmetric (total Chern number $C_{total} = 0$) topological insulator with spinons as the chiral edge states, which carry opposite spin and move in the opposite direction. It is analogous to the quantum spin Hall state but the spin current is carried by deconfined spinons in a quantum spin liquid, so is dubbed as the spinon quantum spin Hall state.</description>

      <title>Fermi Machine -- Quantum Many-Body Solver Derived from Correspondence between Noninteracting and Strongly Correlated Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a quantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to two-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in Ta2NiSe5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of Ta2NiSe5 in its low-temperature semiconducting phase, using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ta L3 edge. We also investigate the electronic properties of Ta2NiSe5 within the density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. While ARPES, dc transport, and optical measurements indicate that Ta2NiSe5 is a small band-gap semiconductor, DFT gives a metallic nonmagnetic solution in Ta2NiSe5 . To obtain the semiconducting ground state in Ta2 NiSe5 we use a self-interaction correction (SIC) procedure by introducing an orbital-dependent potential Vl into the Hamiltonian. We investigate theoretically the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS spectra at the Ni and Ta L3 edges and analyze the spectra in terms of interband transitions. We investigate the RIXS spectra as a function of momentum transfer vector Q and incident photon energy. Because Ta2 NiSe5 possesses only fully occupied (Ni 3d and Se 4p) and completely empty (Ta 5d) shells with the formal valencies Ta5+ (5d0), Ni0 (3d10 ), and Se2- (4p6 ), both the Ni and Ta L3 RIXS spectra belong to a charge transfer type with ligand-to-metal excitations.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo Study of the 1/9 Magnetization Plateau in Kagome Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by very recent experimental observations of the 1/9 magnetization plateaus in YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6+x}$Br$_{3-x}$ and YCu$_3$(OD)$_{6+x}$Br$_{3-x}$, our study delves into the magnetic field-induced phase transitions in the nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice using the variational Monte Carlo technique. We uncover a phase transition from a zero-field Dirac spin liquid to a field-induced magnetically disordered phase that exhibits the 1/9 magnetization plateau. Through a comprehensive analysis encompassing the magnetization distribution, spin correlations, chiral order parameter, topological entanglement entropy, ground-state degeneracy, Chern number and excitation spectrum, we pinpoint the phase associated with this magnetization plateau as a chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological quantum spin liquid and elucidate its diverse physical properties.</description>

      <title>Current Correlations and Conductivity in SYK-Like Systems: An Analytical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a functional-based approach to compute thermal expectation values for actions expressed in the $G-\Sigma$ formalism, applicable to any time sequence ordering. Utilizing this framework, we analyze the linear response to an electric field in various Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) chains. We consider the SYK chain where each dot is a complex $q/2$-body interacting SYK model, and we allow for $r/2$-body nearest-neighbor hopping where $r=\kappa q$. We find exact analytical expressions in the large-$q$ limit for conductivities across all temperatures at leading order in $1/q$ for three cases, namely $\kappa = \{ 1/2, 1, 2\}$. When $\kappa = \{1/2, 1\}$, we observe linear-in-temperature $T$ resistivities at low temperatures, indicative of strange metal behavior. Conversely, when $\kappa = 2$, the resistivity diverges as a power law at low temperatures, namely as $1/T^2$, resembling insulating behavior. As $T$ increases, there is a crossover to Fermi liquid behavior ($\sim T^2$) at the minimum resistivity. Beyond this, another crossover occurs to strange metal behavior ($\sim T$). In comparison to previous linear-in-$T$ results in the literature, we also show that the resistivity behavior exists even below the MIR bound, indicating a true strange metal instead of a bad metal. In particular, we find for the $\kappa = 2$ case a smooth crossover from an insulating phase to a Fermi liquid behavior to a true strange metal and eventually becoming a bad metal as temperature increases. We extend and generalize previously known results on resistivities to all temperatures, do a comparative analysis across the three models where we highlight the universal features and invoke scaling arguments to create a physical picture out of our analyses. Remarkably, we find a universal maximum DC conductivity across all three models when the hopping coupling strength becomes large.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20797v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled states, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) states found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS states exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS state, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. None the less, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS state. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL states can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</description>

      <title>Confined Trions and Mott-Wigner States in a Purely Electrostatic Moir\'e Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e heterostructures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) hetero- and homobilayers have emerged as a promising material platform to study correlated electronic states. Optical signatures of strong correlations in the form of Mott-Wigner states and fractional Chern insulators have already been observed in TMD monolayers and their twisted bilayers. In this work, we use a moir\'e substrate containing a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) interface to externally generate a superlattice potential for the TMD layer: the periodic structure of ferroelectric domains in h-BN effects a purely electrostatic potential for charge carriers. We find direct evidence for the induced moir\'e potential in the emergence of new excitonic resonances at integer fillings, and our observation of an enhancement of the trion binding energy by $\simeq$ 3 meV. A theoretical model for exciton-electron interactions allows us to directly determine the moir\'e potential modulation of 30$\pm$5 meV from the measured trion binding energy shift. We obtain direct evidence for charge order linked to electronic Mott-Wigner states at filling factors $\nu$ = 1/3 and $\nu$ = 2/3 through the associated exciton Umklapp resonances.</description>

      <title>Scaling of contraction costs for multi-scale entanglement renormalization including tensor Trotterization and variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group, and it is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as brickwall circuits of two-qubit gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional alternating least-squares optimization of full MERA. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes: many-body quantum dynamics with MCTDH-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lecture notes on "Many-body Quantum Dynamics with MCTDH-X," adapted from the 2023 Heidelberg MCTDH Summer School, provide an in-depth exploration of the Multiconfigurational Time-Dependent Hartree approach for indistinguishable particles. They serve as a comprehensive guide for understanding and utilizing the MCTDH-X software for both bosonic and fermionic systems. The tutorial begins with an introduction to the MCTDH-X software, highlighting its capability to handle various quantum systems, including those with internal degrees of freedom and long-range interactions. The theoretical foundation is then laid out on how to solve the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\"odinger equations for many-body systems. The workflow section provides practical instructions on setting up and executing simulations using MCTDH-X. Detailed benchmarks against exact solutions are presented, showcasing the accuracy and reliability of the software in ground-state and dynamic simulations. The notes then delve into the dynamics of quantum systems, covering relaxation processes, time evolution, and the analysis of propagation for both bosonic and fermionic particles. The discussion includes the interpretation of various physical quantities such as energy, density distributions, and orbital occupations. Advanced features of MCTDH-X are also explored in the last section, including the calculation of correlation functions and the creation of visualizations through video tutorials. The notes conclude with a Linux/UNIX command cheat sheet, facilitating ease of use for users operating the software on different systems. Overall, these lecture notes provide a valuable resource for researchers and students in the field of quantum dynamics, offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance on the use of MCTDH-X for studying complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is as simple as the Wilson--Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of long-range entanglement in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture.

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of the atomic and electronic structure of monovalent metallic nanocontacts unveiled in transport experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields, from zero field to 20 T. We find a magnetic field induced torque which leads to atomic binding at shorter distances than at zero field. Furthermore, the conductance drops below $G_0$ at high magnetic fields by about 15\% in Au. We calculate the conduction through nanosized Au contacts containing residual $O_2$ molecules attached to the contact region and find a spin polarized current when $O_2$ is located at the atomic contact. We discuss the role of spin-orbit coupling in the magnetic properties of $O_2$ attached to Au.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetries in prethermal phases of periodically driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven closed quantum systems are expected to eventually heat up to infinite temperature reaching a steady state described by a circular orthogonal ensemble (COE). However, such finite driven systems may exhibit sufficiently long prethermal regimes; their properties in these regimes are qualitatively different from that in their infinite temperature steady states. These, often experimentally relevant, prethermal regimes host a wide range of phenomena; they may exhibit dynamical localization and freezing, host Floquet scars, display signatures of Hilbert space fragmentation, and exhibit time crystalline phases. Such phenomena are often accompanied by emergent approximate dynamical symmetries which have no analogue in equilibrium systems. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the origin and nature of these symmetries and discuss their role in shaping the prethermal phases of a class of periodically driven closed quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an elementary set of lectures on generalized global symmetries originally given at the Jena TPI School on QFT and Holography, designed to be accessible to the reader with a basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Topics covered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected applications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on the lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics. Mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on understanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.</description>

      <title>BMach: a Bayesian machine for optimizing Hubbard U parameters in DFT+U with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately determining the effective Hubbard parameter $(U_{eff})$ in Density Functional Theory plus U (DFT+U) remains a significant challenge, often relying on empirical methods or linear response theory, which frequently fail to predict accurate material properties. This study introduces BMach, an advanced Bayesian optimization algorithm that refines $U_{eff}$ by incorporating electronic properties, such as band gaps and eigenvalues, alongside structural properties like lattice parameters. Implemented within the Quantum Espresso platform, BMach demonstrates superior accuracy and reduced computational cost compared to traditional methods. The BMach-optimized $U_{eff}$ values yield electronic properties that align closely with experimental and high-level theoretical results, providing a robust framework for high-throughput materials discovery and detailed electronic property characterization across diverse material systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent dipole field theory in atomic ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of hard-core bosons on ladders, in the presence of strong kinetic constrains akin to those of the Bariev model. We use a combination of analytical methods and numerical simulations to establish the phase diagram of the model. The model displays a paired Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase featuring an emergent dipole symmetry, which encodes the local pairing constraint into a global, non-local quantity. We scrutinize the effect of such emergent low-energy symmetry during quench dynamics including single particle defects. We observe that, despite being approximate, the dipole symmetry still leads to very slow relaxation dynamics, which we model via an effective field theory. The model we discuss is amenable to realization in both cold atoms in optical lattices and Rydberg atom arrays with dynamics taking place solely in the Rydberg manifold. We present a blueprint protocol to observe the effect of emergent dipole symmetry in such experimental platforms, combining adiabatic state preparation with quench dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the U $5f$ covalence and degree of localization in U intermetallics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A procedure for quantifying the U $5f$ electrons' covalence and degree of localization in U intermetallic compounds is presented. To this end, bulk sensitive hard and soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were utilized in combination with density-functional theory (DFT) plus dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. The energy dependence of the photoionization cross-sections allows the disentanglement of the U\,$5f$ contribution to the valence band from the various other atomic subshells so that the computational parameters in the DFT\,+\,DMFT can be reliably determined. Applying this method to UGa$_2$ and UB$_2$ as model compounds from opposite ends of the (de)localization range, we have achieved excellent simulations of the valence band and core-level spectra. The width in the distribution of atomic U\,$5f$ configurations contributing to the ground state, as obtained from the calculations, quantifies the correlated nature and degree of localization of the U\,5$f$. The findings permit answering the longstanding question why different spectroscopic techniques give seemingly different numbers for the U 5$f$ valence in intermetallic U compounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algebra of Chern-Simons Matrix Model and Large $N$ Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the algebra of quantum observables of the Chern-Simons matrix model which was originally proposed by Susskind and Polychronakos to describe electrons in fractional quantum Hall effects. We establish the commutation relations for its generators and study the large $N$ limit of its representation. We show that the large $N$ limit algebra is isomorphic to the uniform in $N$ algebra studied by Costello, which is isomorphic to the deformed double current algebra studied by Guay. Under appropriate scaling limit, we show that the large $N$ limit algebra degenerates to a Lie algebra which admits a surjective map to the affine Lie algebra of $\mathfrak{u}(p)$. This leads to a complete proof of the large $N$ emergence of the $\mathfrak{u}(p)$ current algebra as proposed by Dorey, Tong and Turner. This also suggests a rigorous derivation of edge excitation of a fractional quantum Hall droplet.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic superconducting diode effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal superconductivity, also known as the superconducting diode effect, has been extensively studied in the presence of a magnetic field or some form of ferromagnetic order breaking time-reversal symmetry. We here show that another class of magnetic order known as altermagnetism, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry but does not exhibit a finite net magnetic moment, can also give rise to a superconducting diode effect. Whether this is the case depends on the combination of the system's point group and altermagnetic order parameter which we explore systematically for two-dimensional crystalline systems. If the superconducting electrons are in a centrosymmetric crystalline environment, an electric field $E_z$ (or other sources of inversion symmetry breaking) can be used to turn on and tune the non-reciprocity, yielding an electric-field tunable diode effect; there are also non-centrosymmetric point groups, which are not reached by applying $E_z \neq 0$ in a centrosymmetric crystal, but still allow for an altermagnetic order parameter with non-reciprocal superconductivity. Depending on the residual magnetic point group, the zeros of the critical current asymmetry, $J_c(\hat{n}) - J_c(-\hat{n})$, are pinned along high-symmetry crystalline directions $\hat{n}=\hat{e}_j$ or are free to rotate in the plane of the system. In some cases, the zeros can be rotated by tuning the electric field $E_z$. We discuss all of these phenomena both on the general level using exact symmetry arguments and more explicitly by constructing and solving minimal lattice models. We provide experimental setups to realize the altermagnetic superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction gauge and effective dimensional reduction in the four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by one-dimensional color-electric flux-tube formation in four-dimensional (4D) QCD, we investigate a possibility of effective dimensional reduction in the 4D Yang-Mills (YM) theory. We propose a new gauge fixing of "dimensional reduction (DR) gauge" defined so as to minimize $R_{\mathrm{DR}}~\equiv~\int d^{4}s ~ \mathrm{Tr} \left[ A_{x}^{2}(s) + A_{y}^{2}(s) \right]$, which has a residual gauge symmetry for the gauge function $\Omega (t,z)$ like 2D QCD on the $t$-$z$ plane. We investigate effective dimensional reduction in the DR gauge using SU(3) quenched lattice QCD at $\beta = 6.0$. The amplitude of $A_{x}(s)$ and $A_{y}(s)$ are found to be strongly suppressed in the DR gauge. We consider "$tz$-projection" of $A_{x,y}(s) \to 0$ for the gauge configuration generated in the DR gauge, in a similar sense to Abelian projection in the maximally Abelian gauge. By the $tz$-projection in the DR gauge, the interquark potential is not changed, and $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ play a dominant role in quark confinement. In the DR gauge, we calculate a spatial correlation $\langle \mathrm{Tr} A_{\perp}(s) A_{\perp}(s+ra_{\perp}) \rangle ~ (\perp = x,y)$ and estimate the spatial mass of $A_{\perp}(s) ~ (\perp = x,y)$ as $M \simeq 1.7 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. It is conjectured that this large mass makes $A_{\perp}(s)$ inactive and realizes the dominance of $A_{t}(s)$ and $A_{z}(s)$ in infrared region in the DR gauge. We also calculate the spatial correlation of two temporal link-variables and find that the correlation decreases as $\exp (-mr)$ with $m \simeq 0.6 ~ \mathrm{GeV}$. Using a crude approximation, the 4D YM theory is reduced into an ensemble of 2D YM systems with the coupling of $g_{\rm 2D} = g m$.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of SU(2) gauge theory coupled to four adjoint Higgs fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with matter fields in various representations play an important role in different branches of physics. Recently, it was proposed that several aspects of the interesting pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors near optimal doping may be explained by an emergent $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry. Around the transition with positive hole-doping, one can construct a $(2+1)-$dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory coupled to four adjoint scalar fields which gives rise to a rich phase diagram with a myriad of phases having different broken symmetries. We study the phase diagram of this model on the Euclidean lattice using the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm. We find the existence of multiple broken phases as predicted by previous mean field studies. Depending on the quartic couplings, the $SU(2)$ gauge symmetry is broken down either to $U(1)$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the perturbative description of the model. We further study the confinement-deconfinement transition in this theory, and find that both the broken phases are deconfining in the range of volumes that we studied. However, there exists a marked difference in the behavior of the Polyakov loop between the two phases.</description>
