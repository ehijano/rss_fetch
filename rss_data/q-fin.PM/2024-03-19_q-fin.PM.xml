      <title>Asset management with an ESG mandate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the portfolio frontier and risk premia in equilibrium when an institutional investor aims to minimize the tracking error variance and to attain an ESG score higher than the benchmark's one (ESG mandate). Provided that a negative ESG premium for stocks is priced by the market, we show that an ESG mandate can reduce the mean-variance inefficiency of the portfolio frontier when the asset manager targets a limited over-performance with respect to the benchmark. Instead, for a high over-performance target, an ESG mandate leads to a higher variance. The mean-variance improvement is due to the fact that the ESG mandate induces the asset manager to over-invest in assets with a high mean-standard deviation ratio. In equilibrium, with asset managers and mean-variance investors, a negative ESG premium arises if the ESG mandate is binding for asset managers. A result that is borne out by the data.</description>

      <title>Sparse Index Tracking: Simultaneous Asset Selection and Capital Allocation via $\ell_0$-Constrained Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse index tracking is a prominent passive portfolio management strategy that constructs a sparse portfolio to track a financial index. A sparse portfolio is preferable to a full portfolio in terms of reducing transaction costs and avoiding illiquid assets. To achieve portfolio sparsity, conventional studies have utilized $\ell_p$-norm regularizations as a continuous surrogate of the $\ell_0$-norm regularization. Although these formulations can construct sparse portfolios, their practical application is challenging due to the intricate and time-consuming process of tuning parameters to define the precise upper limit of assets in the portfolio. In this paper, we propose a new problem formulation of sparse index tracking using an $\ell_0$-norm constraint that enables easy control of the upper bound on the number of assets in the portfolio. Moreover, our approach offers a choice between constraints on portfolio and turnover sparsity, further reducing transaction costs by limiting asset updates at each rebalancing interval. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving this problem based on a primal-dual splitting method. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on the S&amp;P500 and Russell3000 index datasets.</description>
