      <title>Dynamics of Infection Spread and Hotspot Growth in Bi-Pathogen Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics with multiple pathogens requires not only new theoretical models but also careful analysis of their practical consequences. Building on the Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion framework (MBRD) introduced in our companion paper, we investigate how the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI) behave under different epidemiological and network conditions. Through numerical experiments, we study the effects of pathogen virulence, diffusion rates, and cross-diffusion on epidemic hotspot formation and long-term prevalence. Our results highlight the role of multiplex structure in amplifying or suppressing co-circulating infections, and provide quantitative insight into conditions that drive persistent epidemic patterns. Beyond epidemiology, these findings have broader implications for multiplex contagion processes such as information diffusion and malware propagation.</description>

      <title>Control across scales: signals, information, and adaptive biological mechanical function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems perform an astonishing array of dynamical processes -- including development and repair, regulation, behavior and motor control, sensing and signaling, and adaptation, among others. Powered by the transduction of stored energy resources, these behaviors enable biological systems to regulate functions, achieve specific outcomes, and maintain stability far from thermodynamic equilibrium. These behaviors span orders of magnitude in length and time: from nanometer-scale molecular motors driving morphogenesis to kilometer-scale seasonal migrations, and from millisecond reflexes to millennia of evolutionary adaptations. While physical laws govern the dynamics of biological systems, they alone are insufficient to fully explain how living systems sense, decide, adapt, and, ultimately, control their dynamics. In this article, we argue that control theory provides a powerful, unifying framework for understanding how biological systems regulate dynamics to maintain stability across length and time scales far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the positive gene autoregulation loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gene expression in response to stimuli is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) through feedback loop motifs, aimed at maintaining the desired TF concentration despite uncertainties and perturbations. In this work, we consider a stochastic model of the positive gene autoregulating feedback loop and we probabilistically quantify its resilience, \textit{i.e.}, its ability to preserve the equilibrium associated with a prescribed concentration of TFs, and the corresponding basin of attraction, in the presence of noise. We show that the formation of larger oligomers, corresponding to larger Hill coefficients of the regulation function, and thus to sharper non-linearities, improves the system resilience, even close to critical concentrations of TFs. We also explore a complementary definition of resilience that can be assessed within a stochastic formulation relying on the Fokker-Planck equation. Our formal results are accompanied by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Controlling Competing Feedback Mechanisms for Programmable Patterns via Nonlinear Laser Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling laser-induced pattern formation remains a long-standing challenge. A key advance was recognising the pivotal role of intrinsic feedback mechanisms in self-organisation, which enabled self-similar patterns with long-range order through nonlinear laser lithography. This concept was recently leveraged to surpass the diffraction limit. However, demonstrated structures in laser-induced pattern formation have been relatively simple and material-specific, as they rely on a single assumed formation mechanism for each material. Here, we reveal the coexistence of competing feedback mechanisms that drive distinct chemical and ablative processes, resulting in patterns with different symmetries. We show that one mechanism can be selectively activated, while completely suppressing the other, by tuning the laser parameters independently of the material. The competing mechanisms break surface symmetries in distinct lateral and vertical directions, and the selection can be dynamically inverted in situ, leading to rich surface chemistries and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications through the maskless and ambient-air fabrication of complex composite patterns on diverse materials and substrates. These include seamlessly stitched superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic domains, structural colour, and a holographic temperature sensor. Combining programmable mechanism selection with recent demonstrations of sub-10 nm features could enable the maskless fabrication of composite structures that rival the capabilities of nanofabrication techniques.</description>
