      <title>Pharmolix-FM: An All-Atom Multi-Modal Foundation Model for Molecular Modeling and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic interactions lie at the heart of molecular structures and functions, serving as the foundation for a wide range of molecular interaction tasks. To establish a unified framework for modeling diverse molecular systems, we propose Pharmolix-FM, a generative model that operates at the all-atom level, enabling consistent representation and interaction modeling across different biomolecules. Pharmolix-FM integrates multiple state-of-the-art generative modeling approaches and allows for unified evaluation across multiple tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Through a systematic comparison of different generative algorithms within this framework, we provide a comprehensive analysis of their effectiveness in molecular interaction tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Pharmolix-FM achieves superior performance across various tasks, highlighting its potential for advancing molecular interaction modeling. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/PharMolix/OpenBioMed.</description>

      <title>PharmAgents: Building a Virtual Pharma with Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of novel small molecule drugs remains a critical scientific challenge with far-reaching implications for treating diseases and advancing human health. Traditional drug development--especially for small molecule therapeutics--is a highly complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming process that requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the rise of large language models (LLMs), present a transformative opportunity to streamline and accelerate this process. In this paper, we introduce PharmAgents, a virtual pharmaceutical ecosystem driven by LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. PharmAgents simulates the full drug discovery workflow--from target discovery to preclinical evaluation--by integrating explainable, LLM-driven agents equipped with specialized machine learning models and computational tools. Through structured knowledge exchange and automated optimization, PharmAgents identifies potential therapeutic targets, discovers promising lead compounds, enhances binding affinity and key molecular properties, and performs in silico analyses of toxicity and synthetic feasibility. Additionally, the system supports interpretability, agent interaction, and self-evolvement, enabling it to refine future drug designs based on prior experience. By showcasing the potential of LLM-powered multi-agent systems in drug discovery, this work establishes a new paradigm for autonomous, explainable, and scalable pharmaceutical research, with future extensions toward comprehensive drug lifecycle management.</description>

      <title>RiboGen: RNA Sequence and Structure Co-Generation with Equivariant MultiFlow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays fundamental roles in biological systems, from carrying genetic information to performing enzymatic function. Understanding and designing RNA can enable novel therapeutic application and biotechnological innovation. To enhance RNA design, in this paper we introduce RiboGen, the first deep learning model to simultaneously generate RNA sequence and all-atom 3D structure. RiboGen leverages the standard Flow Matching with Discrete Flow Matching in a multimodal data representation. RiboGen is based on Euclidean Equivariant neural networks for efficiently processing and learning three-dimensional geometry. Our experiments show that RiboGen can efficiently generate chemically plausible and self-consistent RNA samples. Our results suggest that co-generation of sequence and structure is a competitive approach for modeling RNA.</description>
