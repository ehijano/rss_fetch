      <title>RA-BLIP: Multimodal Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently received substantial interest, which shows their emerging potential as general-purpose models for various vision-language tasks. MLLMs involve significant external knowledge within their parameters; however, it is challenging to continually update these models with the latest knowledge, which involves huge computational costs and poor interpretability. Retrieval augmentation techniques have proven to be effective plugins for both LLMs and MLLMs. In this study, we propose multimodal adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (RA-BLIP), a novel retrieval-augmented framework for various MLLMs. Considering the redundant information within vision modality, we first leverage the question to instruct the extraction of visual information through interactions with one set of learnable queries, minimizing irrelevant interference during retrieval and generation. Besides, we introduce a pre-trained multimodal adaptive fusion module to achieve question text-to-multimodal retrieval and integration of multimodal knowledge by projecting visual and language modalities into a unified semantic space. Furthermore, we present an Adaptive Selection Knowledge Generation (ASKG) strategy to train the generator to autonomously discern the relevance of retrieved knowledge, which realizes excellent denoising performance. Extensive experiments on open multimodal question-answering datasets demonstrate that RA-BLIP achieves significant performance and surpasses the state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented models.</description>

      <title>Parallel Backpropagation for Inverse of a Convolution with Application to Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use Inverse Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse convolution layer resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Sentiment-Controlled Feedback For Multimodal Text and Image Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to generate sentiment-controlled feedback in response to multimodal inputs comprising text and images addresses a critical gap in human-computer interaction. This capability allows systems to provide empathetic, accurate, and engaging responses, with useful applications in education, healthcare, marketing, and customer service. To this end, we have constructed a large-scale Controllable Multimodal Feedback Synthesis (CMFeed) dataset and propose a controllable feedback synthesis system. The system features an encoder, decoder, and controllability block for textual and visual inputs. It extracts features using a transformer and Faster R-CNN networks, combining them to generate feedback. The CMFeed dataset includes images, texts, reactions to the posts, human comments with relevance scores, and reactions to these comments. These reactions train the model to produce feedback with specified sentiments, achieving a sentiment classification accuracy of 77.23\%, which is 18.82\% higher than the accuracy without controllability. The system also incorporates a similarity module for assessing feedback relevance through rank-based metrics and an interpretability technique to analyze the contributions of textual and visual features during feedback generation. Access to the CMFeed dataset and the system's code is available at https://github.com/MIntelligence-Group/CMFeed.</description>

      <title>Perceptual Quality Assessment of Octree-RAHT Encoded 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No-reference bitstream-layer point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) can be deployed without full decoding at any network node to achieve real-time quality monitoring. In this work, we focus on the PCQA problem dedicated to Octree-RAHT encoding mode. First, to address the issue that existing PCQA databases have a small scale and limited distortion levels, we establish the WPC5.0 database which is the first one dedicated to Octree-RAHT encoding mode with a scale of 400 distorted point clouds (PCs) including 4 geometric multiplied by 5 attitude distortion levels. Then, we propose the first PCQA model dedicated to Octree-RAHT encoding mode by parsing PC bitstreams without full decoding. The model introduces texture bitrate (TBPP) to predict texture complexity (TC) and further derives the texture distortion factor. In addition, the Geometric Quantization Parameter (PQS) is used to estimate the geometric distortion factor, which is then integrated into the model along with the texture distortion factor to obtain the proposed PCQA model named streamPCQ-OR. The proposed model has been compared with other advanced PCQA methods on the WPC5.0, BASICS and M-PCCD databases, and experimental results show that our model has excellent performance while having very low computational complexity, providing a reliable choice for time-critical applications. To facilitate subsequent research, the database and source code will be publicly released at https://github.com/qdushl/Waterloo-Point-Cloud-Database-5.0.</description>

      <title>Movie101v2: Improved Movie Narration Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatic movie narration aims to generate video-aligned plot descriptions to assist visually impaired audiences. Unlike standard video captioning, it involves not only describing key visual details but also inferring plots that unfold across multiple movie shots, presenting distinct and complex challenges. To advance this field, we introduce Movie101v2, a large-scale, bilingual dataset with enhanced data quality specifically designed for movie narration. Revisiting the task, we propose breaking down the ultimate goal of automatic movie narration into three progressive stages, offering a clear roadmap with corresponding evaluation metrics. Based on our new benchmark, we baseline a range of large vision-language models, including GPT-4V, and conduct an in-depth analysis of the challenges in narration generation. Our findings highlight that achieving applicable movie narration generation is a fascinating goal that requires significant research.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Semantic Variation in Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation and visualization of human instructions are crucial for text-to-image (T2I) synthesis. However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders. Our work establishes an effective evaluation framework that advances the T2I synthesis community's exploration of human instruction understanding. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/zhuxiangru/SemVarBench .</description>

      <title>MixEval-X: Any-to-Any Evaluations from Real-World Data Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any, real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across diverse input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions. Meanwhile, MixEval-X's model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98) while being much more efficient. We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research.</description>
