      <title>Learning and Interpreting Gravitational-Wave Features from CNNs with a Random Forest Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely adopted in gravitational wave (GW) detection pipelines due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics - variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude - computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21\% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR $\le$ 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature attribution via the RF model reveals that both CNN-extracted and handcrafted features contribute significantly to classification decisions, with learned variance and CNN outputs ranked among the most informative. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks offer a powerful framework for modeling complex systems across diverse domains, effectively capturing multiple types of connections and interdependent subsystems commonly found in real world scenarios. To analyze these networks, embedding techniques that project nodes into a lower-dimensional geometric space are essential. This paper introduces a novel hyperbolic embedding framework that advances the state of the art in multilayer network analysis. Our method, which supports heterogeneous node sets across networks and inter-layer connections, generates layer-specific hyperbolic embeddings, enabling detailed intra-layer analysis and inter-layer comparisons, while simultaneously preserving the global multilayer structure within hyperbolic space, a capability that sets it apart from existing approaches, which typically rely on independent embedding of layers. Through experiments on synthetic multilayer stochastic block models, we demonstrate that our approach effectively preserves community structure, even when layers consist of different node sets. When applied to real brain networks, the method successfully clusters disease-related brain regions from different patients, outperforming layer-independent approaches and highlighting its relevance for comparative analysis. Overall, this work provides a robust tool for multilayer network analysis, enhancing interpretability and offering new insights into the structure and function of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their role in wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this inter-connectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. Here, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher crime levels. Specifically, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population constant. We show that models incorporating both population and commuter inflows better explain crime variation than population-only models. These findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</description>

      <title>UniFoil: A Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>

      <title>Scintillation pulse characterization with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks: case studies on particle detector signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle detectors based on scintillators are widely used in high-energy physics and astroparticle physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Towards energy-insensitive and robust neutron/gamma classification: A learning-based frequency-domain parametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron/gamma discrimination has been intensively researched in recent years, due to its unique scientific value and widespread applications. With the advancement of detection materials and algorithms, nowadays we can achieve fairly good discrimination. However, further improvements rely on better utilization of detector raw signals, especially energy-independent pulse characteristics. We begin by discussing why figure-of-merit (FoM) is not a comprehensive criterion for high-precision neutron/gamma discriminators, and proposing a new evaluation method based on adversarial sampling. Inspired by frequency-domain analysis in existing literature, parametric linear/nonlinear models with minimum complexity are created, upon the discrete spectrum, with tunable parameters just as neural networks. We train the models on an open-source neutron/gamma dataset (CLYC crystals with silicon photomultipliers) preprocessed by charge normalization to discover and exploit energy-independent features. The performance is evaluated on different sampling rates and noise levels, in comparison with the frequency classification index and conventional methods. The frequency-domain parametric models show higher accuracy and better adaptability to variations of data integrity than other discriminators. The proposed method is also promising for online inference on economical hardware and portable devices.</description>

      <title>The influence of data gaps and outliers on resilience indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resilience, or stability, of major Earth system components is increasingly threatened by anthropogenic pressures, demanding reliable early warning signals for abrupt and irreversible regime shifts. Widely used data-driven resilience indicators based on variance and autocorrelation detect `critical slowing down', a signature of decreasing stability. However, the interpretation of these indicators is hampered by poorly understood interdependencies and their susceptibility to common data issues such as missing values and outliers. Here, we establish a rigorous mathematical analysis of the statistical dependency between variance- and autocorrelation-based resilience indicators, revealing that their agreement is fundamentally driven by the time series' initial data point. Using synthetic and empirical data, we demonstrate that missing values substantially weaken indicator agreement, while outliers introduce systematic biases that lead to overestimation of resilience based on temporal autocorrelation. Our results provide a necessary and rigorous foundation for preprocessing strategies and accuracy assessments across the growing number of disciplines that use real-world data to infer changes in system resilience.</description>
