      <title>On weakly amenable groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study groupoids and their approximation properties, generalizing both the definitions and some known results for the group case. More precisely, we introduce weak amenability for groupoids using the definition of the Fourier algebra given by Renault. We prove that weakly amenable groupoids are inner exact. We also generalize its algebraic counterpart, the CBAP. To do this we introduce the notion of a quasi Cartan pair $(B,A)$ and see that $(C_r^*(G),C_0(G^0))$ can be viewed as such. We then define what it means for a pair $(B,A)$ to have the CBAP. We introduce the Cowling-Haagerup constants associated to these approximation properties and prove that $\Lambda_{\text{cb}}(C_r^*(G),C_0(G^0)) \leq \Lambda_{\text{cb}}(G)$. We then study some classes of groupoids where we could achieve equality, that is, $\Lambda_{\text{cb}}(G) = \Lambda_{\text{cb}}(C_r^*(G),C_0(G^0))$. They are discrete groupoids and groupoids arising from partial actions of a discrete group $\Gamma$ on a locally compact Hausdorff space $X$.</description>

      <title>Principal Actions on Topological Quivers and Associated Operator Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological quivers $Q$ admitting a free and proper action by a locally compact group $G$ together with their associated $C^*$-algebras. On the topological side, we provide a complete classification of topological quivers which admit such actions in terms of $G$-bundles over the vertex orbit space and an appropriate isomorphism of bundles over the edge orbits. Following the work by Deaconu, Kumjian, and Quigg on topological graphs, we construct an isomorphism between $C^*(Q/G)$ and Rieffel's fixed-point algebra $C^*(Q)^\alpha$, which is known to be Morita equivalent to $C^*(Q)\rtimes_rG$. Unlike the work with topological graphs, we use previously developed functoriality techniques to identify the isomorphism. We also examine many concrete examples of such group actions, including some exclusive to topological quivers, and the associated Morita equivalences.</description>

      <title>Generalized Double Operator Integrals: Finite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Double Operator Integral (DOI) framework provides a powerful tool for analyzing perturbations and interactions between self-adjoint operators in functional analysis and spectral theory. However, most existing DOI formulations rely on self-adjointness (Hermitian) or unitary assumptions, limiting their applicability to non-Hermitian settings. Motivated by advancements in non-Hermitian physics and operator theory, this paper introduces Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs), extending DOI theory to arbitrary non-Hermitian and non-normal matrices. We establish key algebraic properties of GDOIs, derive norm estimations, and develop a perturbation formula that leads to Lipschitz continuity estimates for operator functions. Additionally, we prove the continuity of GDOIs and explore applications in random matrix theory and functional analysis, including tail bounds and H\"older-type estimations. These results provide a unified and flexible integral framework for non-Hermitian spectral analysis, broadening the impact of DOI techniques in non-commutative analysis and mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>W$^*$-superrigidity for property (T) groups with infinite center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to study a natural version of Connes' Rigidity Conjecture that involves property (T) groups with infinite center. Utilizing techniques at the intersection of von Neumann algebras and geometric group theory, we establish several cases where this conjecture holds. In particular, we provide the first example of a W$^*$-superrigid property (T) group with infinite center. In the course of proving our main results, we also generalize the main W$^*$-superrigidity result from \cite{cios22} to twisted group factors.</description>
