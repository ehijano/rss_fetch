      <title>On GL-domains and the ascent of the IDF property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the terminology introduced by Arnold and Sheldon back in 1975, we say that an integral domain $D$ is a GL-domain if the product of any two primitive polynomials over $D$ is again a primitive polynomial. In this paper, we study the class of GL-domains. First, we propose a characterization of GL-domain in terms of certain elements we call prime-like. Then we identify a new class of GL-domains. An integral domain $D$ is also said to have the IDF property provided that each nonzero element of $D$ is divisible by only finitely many non-associate irreducible divisors. It was proved by Malcolmson and Okoh in 2009 that the IDF property ascends to polynomial extensions when restricted to the class of GCD-domains. This result was recently strengthened by Gotti and Zafrullah to the class of PSP-domains. We conclude this paper by proving that the IDF property does not ascend to polynomial extensions when restricted to the class of GL-domains, answering an open question posed by Gotti and Zafrullah.</description>

      <title>On the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem over General Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rings over which an analogue of the Weierstrass preparation theorem holds for power series. We show that a commutative ring $R$ admits a factorization of every power series in $R[[x]]$ as the product of a polynomial and a unit if and only if $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local principal ideal rings. We also characterize Noetherian rings $R$ for which this factorization holds under the weaker condition that the coefficients of the series generate the unit ideal: this occurs precisely when $R$ is isomorphic to a finite product of complete local Noetherian integral domains.
  Beyond this, we investigate the failure of Weierstrass-type preparation in finitely generated rings and prove a general transcendence result for zeros of $p$-adic power series, producing a large class of power series over number rings that cannot be written as a polynomial times a unit. Finally, we show that for a finitely generated infinite commutative ring $R$, the decision problem of determining whether an integer power series (with computable coefficients) factors as a polynomial times a unit in $R[[x]]$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Some four-dimensional orthogonal invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and $\mathbb{F}_p$ be the prime field of order $p$. Consider a $2$-dimensional orthogonal group $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ acting on the standard representation $V$ and the dual space $V^*$. We compute the invariant ring $\mathbb{F}_p[V\oplus V^*]^G$ via explicitly exhibiting a minimal generating set. Our method finds an application of $s$-invariants appeared in covariant theory of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Overrings of half-factorial orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of factorization properties in various ring extensions is a central theme in commutative algebra. Classically, the UFDs are (completely) integrally closed and tend to behave well in standard ring extensions, with the notable exception of power series extension. The half-factorial property is not as robust; HFDs need not be integrally closed and the half-factorial property is not necessarily preserved in integral extensions or even localizations. Here we exhibit classes of HFDs that behave well in (almost) integral extensions, resolve an open question on the behavior of the boundary map, and give a squeeze theorem for elasticity in certain domains.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of germs (of mappings and sets) over k vs that over K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider real-analytic mapping-germs, (R^n,o)-&gt; (R^m,o). They can be equivalent (by coordinate changes) complex-analytically, but not real-analytically. However, if the transformation of complex-equivalence is identity modulo higher order terms, then it implies the real-equivalence.
  On the other hand, starting from complex-analytic map-germs (C^n,o)-&gt;(C^m,o), and taking any field extension, C to K, one has: if two maps are equivalent over K, then they are equivalent over C.
  These (quite useful) properties seem to be not well known. We prove slightly stronger properties in a more general form:
  * for Maps(X,Y) where X,Y are (formal/analytic/Nash) scheme-germs, with arbitrary singularities, over a base ring k;
  * for the classical groups of (right/left-right/contact) equivalence of Singularity Theory;
  * for faithfully-flat extensions of rings k -&gt; K. In particular, for arbitrary extension of fields, in any characteristic.
  The case ``k is a ring" is important for the study of deformations/unfoldings. E.g. it implies the statement for fields: if a family of maps {f_t} is trivial over K, then it is also trivial over k.
  Similar statements for scheme-germs (``isomorphism over K vs isomorphism over k") follow by the standard reduction ``Two maps are contact equivalent iff their zero sets are ambient isomorphic".
  This study involves the contact equivalence of maps with singular targets, which seems to be not well-established. We write down the relevant part of this theory.</description>

      <title>Obstruction Theory for Bigraded Differential Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for Hirsch extensions of cbba's with twisted coefficients. This leads to a variety of applications, including a structural theorem for minimal cbba's, a construction of relative minimal models with twisted coefficients, as well as a proof of uniqueness. These results are further employed to study automorphism groups of minimal cbba's and to characterize formality in terms of grading automorphisms.</description>
