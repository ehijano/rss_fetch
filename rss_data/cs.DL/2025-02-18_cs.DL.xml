      <title>Scientific literature cited in patents: A Technology Transfer indicator in Portuguese universities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study aims to identify the process of transfer from science to technology that occurs in the main Portuguese public universities. The methodology was based on the analysis of the scientific literature cited in patents. Data was obtained from the Lens patent database. 10,514 scientific articles cited in patents were retrieved. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. Science maps were created to visualize the main research trends. The results showed a valuable impact of academic research in certain scientific disciplines, such as Chemistry, Biology, Materials Sciences and Medicine. The main research fronts were cancer, nanoparticles, biomaterials, tissue engineering or molecular biology. In conclusion, the research produced by Portuguese universities has generated relevant knowledge for patented inventions and the science-technology flow within specific areas.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quaternary Decoder Design Utilizing 32nm CMOS and GNRFET Technology for Enhanced High-Density Memory Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Valued Logic (MVL) has more than one logic level defined to represent data whereas binary logic has 2 logic levels. It has been shown that the MVL circuits use the circuit resources more effectively at different voltage levels with less circuitry and greater efficiency. Recently, graphene nano-ribbon field effect transistor (GNRFET) has drawn a lot of interest due to its higher electron mobility. This paper presents quaternary decoder implemented in GNRFET and analyzed latency, power, performance etc. also compared the power and delay characteristics of the design implemented both in CMOS and Graphene Nano Ribbon Field Effect Transistor (GNRFET) in the 32nm technology node.</description>

      <title>Research on Research Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This editorial explores the significance of research visibility within the evolving landscape of academic communication, mainly focusing on the role of search engines as online meta-markets shaping the impact of research. With the rapid expansion of scientific output and the increasing reliance on algorithm-driven platforms such as Google and Google Scholar, the online visibility of scholarly work has become an essential factor in determining its reach and influence. The need for more rigorous research into academic search engine optimization (A-SEO), a field still in its infancy despite its growing relevance, is also discussed, highlighting key challenges in the field, including the lack of robust research methodologies, the skepticism within the academic community regarding the commercialization of science, and the need for standardization in reporting and measurement techniques. This editorial thus invites a multidisciplinary dialogue on the future of research visibility, with significant implications for academic publishing, science communication, research evaluation, and the global scientific ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Factors Paper-Reviewer Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in paper submissions to academic conferences, the need for automated and accurate paper-reviewer matching is more critical than ever. Previous efforts in this area have considered various factors to assess the relevance of a reviewer's expertise to a paper, such as the semantic similarity, shared topics, and citation connections between the paper and the reviewer's previous works. However, most of these studies focus on only one factor, resulting in an incomplete evaluation of the paper-reviewer relevance. To address this issue, we propose a unified model for paper-reviewer matching that jointly considers semantic, topic, and citation factors. To be specific, during training, we instruction-tune a contextualized language model shared across all factors to capture their commonalities and characteristics; during inference, we chain the three factors to enable step-by-step, coarse-to-fine search for qualified reviewers given a submission. Experiments on four datasets (one of which is newly contributed by us) spanning various fields such as machine learning, computer vision, information retrieval, and data mining consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Chain-of-Factors model in comparison with state-of-the-art paper-reviewer matching methods and scientific pre-trained language models.</description>

      <title>Human-LLM Coevolution: Evidence from Academic Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With a statistical analysis of arXiv paper abstracts, we report a marked drop in the frequency of several words previously identified as overused by ChatGPT, such as "delve", starting soon after they were pointed out in early 2024. The frequency of certain other words favored by ChatGPT, such as "significant", has instead kept increasing. These phenomena suggest that some authors of academic papers have adapted their use of large language models (LLMs), for example, by selecting outputs or applying modifications to the LLM-generated content. Such coevolution and cooperation of humans and LLMs thus introduce additional challenges to the detection of machine-generated text in real-world scenarios. Estimating the impact of LLMs on academic writing by examining word frequency remains feasible, and more attention should be paid to words that were already frequently employed, including those that have decreased in frequency due to LLMs' disfavor.</description>
