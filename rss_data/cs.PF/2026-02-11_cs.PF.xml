      <title>XLB: A High Performance Layer-7 Load Balancer for Microservices using eBPF-based In-kernel Interposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: L7 load balancers are a fundamental building block in microservices as they enable fine-grained traffic distribution. Compared to monolithic applications, microservices demand higher performance and stricter isolation from load balancers. This is due to the increased number of instances, longer service chains, and the necessity for co-location with services on the same host. Traditional sidecar-based load balancers are ill-equipped to meet these demands, often resulting in significant performance degradation.
  In this work, we present XLB, a novel architecture that reshapes L7 load balancers as in-kernel interposition operating on the socket layer. We leverage eBPF to implement the core load balancing logic in the kernel, and address the connection management and state maintenance challenges through novel socket layer redirection and nested eBPF maps designs. XLB eliminates the extra overhead of scheduling, communication, and data movement, resulting in a more lightweight, scalable, and efficient L7 load balancer architecture. Compared to the widely used microservices load balancers (Istio and Cilium), over 50 microservice instances, XLB achieves up to 1.5x higher throughput and 60% lower end-to-end latency.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Scaling Laws for Dense and Sparse Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements of large language models (LLMs), optimally predicting the model size for LLM pretraining or allocating optimal resources still remains a challenge. Several efforts have addressed the challenge by proposing different empirical scaling laws, but almost all of them are architecture-specific (dense or sparse). In this work we revisit existing empirical scaling laws and propose a generalized scaling law to provide a unified framework that is applicable to both dense and sparse large language models. We evaluate and compare our proposed scaling law with existing scaling laws and demonstrate that our proposed scaling law captures the scaling behavior of existing scaling laws. Further, we show an IsoFLOP comparison between our proposed scaling law and the state-of-the-art scaling law to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed scaling law for Mixture-of-Expert (MoE)-based very large LLMs like DeepSeek-V3. Our proposed scaling law can be used to estimate the best model hyperparameters (Model size, Tokens and Compute) for a given sparsity or to identify the optimal sparsity for the given model hyperparameters.</description>
