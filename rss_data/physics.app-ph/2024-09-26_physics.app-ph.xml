      <title>Pulse Shaping Strategies for Efficient Switching of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions by Spin-Orbit Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The writing energy for reversing the magnetization of the free layer in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is a key figure of merit for comparing the performances of magnetic random access memories with competing technologies. Magnetization switching of MTJs induced by spin torques typically relies on square voltage pulses. Here, we focus on the switching of perpendicular MTJs driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT), for which the magnetization reversal process consists of sequential domain nucleation and domain wall propagation. By performing a systematic study of the switching efficiency and speed as a function of pulse shape, we show that shaped pulses achieve up to 50% reduction of writing energy compared to square pulses without compromising the switching probability and speed. Time-resolved measurements of the tunneling magnetoresistance reveal how the switching times are strongly impacted by the pulse shape and temperature rise during the pulse. The optimal pulse shape consists of a preheating phase, a maximum amplitude to induce domain nucleation, and a lower amplitude phase to complete the reversal. Our experimental results, corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, provide diverse options to reduce the energy footprint of SOT devices in magnetic memory applications.</description>

      <title>Wide-field microwave magnetic field imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of microwave (MW) magnetic fields with microscale lateral resolution is pivotal for various applications, such as MW technologies and integrated circuit failure analysis. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a 2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\sim$ 9 $\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total measurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\times340$ $\mu$m$^2$ field of view with a $\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic range of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based on differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging capabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to measure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Reservoir Computing based on Nonlinear Nanomechanical Resonators at Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to deep neural networks (DNNs) by replacing complex hidden layers with a fixed nonlinear system and training only the final layer. This work investigates nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) resonators for reservoir computing, utilizing inherent nonlinearities and the fading memory effect from NEMS's transient response. This approach transforms input data into a higher-dimensional space for effective classification. The smaller size and higher operating frequencies of the NEMS resonators enable faster processing rates than recent demonstrations with micromechanical systems, while their compact footprint and ability to operate under ambient conditions simplify integration into practical applications. Through an MNIST handwritten digit recognition test, this system achieved 90% accuracy with a 3.3-microsecond processing time per pixel, highlighting the potential for various applications that require efficient and fast information processing in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent multiexciton dynamics governs scintillation from perovskite quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent emergence of quantum confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers potentially revolutionary scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimisation of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, we address these open questions by theoretically and experimentally studying the size-dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results reveal and unravel a complex parametric space where the fine balance between the simultaneous effects of size-dependent energy deposition, (multi-)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The remarkable agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that unprecedentedly predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing the first fundamental guide for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.</description>

      <title>An Active Electromagnetic 3D Surface Cloak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An active interior cloak is composed of a conformal array of radiating sources surrounding a target object. With proper configuration, this array radiates a field discontinuity which cancels out any scattering which occurs when the object is illuminated by an impinging electromagnetic wave. Unlike many other cloaking methods, an interior cloak can be completely constructed using conventional components while its active nature allows it to circumvent passivity-based constraints. This enables an interior cloak to hide an object of virtually any size, shape, and material composition as well as accommodate multiple frequencies and polarizations. Despite its potential, this approach has only been demonstrated on 2D and quasi-2D targets to date. As such, this paper presents the first 3D implementation of an interior cloak. Here, the design of a cloak array capable of hiding a conductive, circular cylinder in free-space is first presented. Cloaking performance is then validated via full-wave simulations and an experimental demonstration in which the device successfully suppresses scattering when the target is illuminated by a ridged horn antenna at 1.2 GHz.</description>

      <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost-effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top-down fabricated nanostructures. Here we present a versatile bottom-up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures, and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6, which we combine with a novel solution-derived material with high effective second-order nonlinearity of d_{eff}=5 pm/V. On this platform, we demonstrate second-harmonic focusing over a broad spectral range from near-UV to near-IR, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. Our method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low-cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear nanostructures</description>

      <title>Optical multi-beam steering and communication using integrated acousto-optics arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical beam steering enables optical detection and imaging in macroscopic or microscopic scales and long-range communication over free space. It underpins numerous optical applications, including LiDAR, biomedical imaging, and remote sensing. Despite the inherent speed of light, advanced applications increasingly require the ability to steer multiple beams simultaneously to increase imaging throughput, boost communication bandwidth, and control arrays qubits for scalable quantum computing. Therefore, there is a significant demand for non-mechanical, integrated, and scalable multi-beam steering technology. Here, we report a scalable multi-beam steering system comprising an array of acousto-optic beam steering channels and photonic integrated circuits on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. Each channel generates tens of individually controllable beams of visible wavelength by exciting acoustic waves using digitally synthesized multi-tone microwave signals. We demonstrate the system's capabilities through multi-input, multi-output free-space communications, simultaneously transmitting to multiple receivers at megabits/sec data rates. This technology can be readily scaled up to steer hundreds of optical beams from a compact chip, potentially advancing many areas of optical technologies and enabling novel applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the surface morphology of GaSb epitaxial layers deposited by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on GaAs (100) substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a demonstration of the surface morphology behavior of gallium antimonide (GaSb) layers deposited on gallium arsenide (GaAs) (100) substrates using three different methods: metamorphic, interfacial misfit (IMF) matrix, and a method based on a Polish patent application number P.443805. The first two methods are commonly used, while the third differs in the sequence of successive steps and the presence of Be doping at the initial growth stage. By comparing GaSb layers made by these methods for the same growth parameters, the most favorable procedure for forming a GaSb buffer layer is selected. Using GaAs substrates with a GaSb buffer layer is a cheaper alternative to using GaSb substrates in infrared detector structures based on II-type superlattices T2SL, such as InAs/GaSb. The quality of the GaSb buffer layer determines the quality of the subsequent layers that form the entire T2SL and affects factors such as dark current in terms of application</description>

      <title>Rapid Prototyping of 3D Microstructures: A Simplified Grayscale Lithography Encoding Method Using Blender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The democratization of fabrication equipment has spurred recent interest in maskless grayscale lithography for both 2D and 3D microfabrication. However, the design of suitable template images remains a challenge. This work presents a simplified method for encoding 3D objects into grayscale image files optimized for grayscale lithography. Leveraging the widely used, open-source 3D modeling software Blender, we developed a robust approach to convert geometric heights into grayscale levels and generate image files through top-view rendering. Our method accurately reproduced the overall shape of simple structures like stairs and ramps compared to the original designs. We extended this approach to complex 3D sinusoidal surfaces, achieving similar results. Given the increasing accessibility and user-friendliness of digital rendering tools, this study offers a promising strategy for rapid prototyping of initial designs with minimal effort.</description>

Abstract: We introduce multijunction active layers, featuring a stack of alternating active layers and tunnel junctions, to PCSELs to increase their slope efficiency, which is vital for various applications including laser processing and LiDAR. First, we design a multijunction PCSEL that avoids optical absorption in the heavily-doped tunnel junctions while allowing sufficient optical gain and resonance effects in the active and photonic crystal layers. Next, we fabricate a 3-mm-diameter two-junction PCSEL, achieving a slope efficiency of 1.58 W/A, which is over twice as high as that of conventional single-junction PCSELs, and a record-high peak output power of 1.8 kW for PCSELs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneously integrated hybrid photonic crystal cavities enable strong light-matter interactions with solid-state, optically addressable quantum memories. A key challenge to realizing high quality factor (Q) hybrid photonic crystals is the reduced index contrast on the substrate compared to suspended devices in air. This challenge is particularly acute for color centers in diamond because of diamond's high refractive index, which leads to increased scattering loss into the substrate. Here we develop a design methodology for hybrid photonic crystals utilizing a detailed understanding of substrate-mediated loss, which incorporates sensitivity to fabrication errors as a critical parameter. Using this methodology we design robust, high-Q, GaAs-on-diamond photonic crystal cavities, and by optimizing our fabrication procedure we experimentally realize cavities with Q approaching 30,000 at a resonance wavelength of 955 nm.</description>

      <title>Free-standing bilayer metasurfaces in the visible</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mult-layered meta-optics have enabled complex wavefront shaping beyond their single layer counterpart owing to the additional design variables afforded by each plane. For instance, complex amplitude modulation, generalized polarization transformations, and wide field of view are key attributes that fundamentally require multi-plane wavefront matching. Nevertheless, existing embodiments of bilayer metasurfaces have relied on configurations which suffer from Fresnel reflections, low mode confinement, or undesired resonances which compromise the intended response. Here, we introduce bilayer metasurfaces made of free-standing meta-atoms working in the visible spectrum. We demonstrate their use in wavefront shaping of linearly polarized light using pure geometric phase with diffraction efficiency of 80 % expanding previous literature on Pancharatnam-Berry phase metasurfaces which rely on circularly or elliptically polarized illumination. The fabrication relies on a two-step lithography and selective development processes which yield free standing, bilayer stacked metasurfaces, of 1200 nm total thickness. The metasurfaces comprise TiO2 nanofins with vertical side walls. Our work advances the nanofabrication of compound meta-optics and inspires new directions in wavefront shaping, metasurface integration, and polarization control.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal scintillation using one-dimensional magneto-optical photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillation describes the conversion of high-energy particles into light in transparent media and finds diverse applications such as high-energy particle detection and industrial and medical imaging. This process operates on multiple timescales, with the final radiative step consisting of spontaneous emission, which can be modeled within the framework of quasi-equilibrium fluctuational electrodynamics. Scintillation can therefore be controlled and enhanced via nanophotonic effects, which has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Such designs have thus far obeyed Lorentz reciprocity, meaning there is a direct equivalence between scintillation emission and absorption by the scintillator. However, scintillators that do not obey Lorentz reciprocity have not been explored, even though they represent a novel platform for probing emission which is both nonequilibrium and nonreciprocal in nature. In this work, we propose to harness nonreciprocity to achieve directional control of scintillation emission, granting an additional degree of control over scintillation. Such directionality of light output is important in improving collection efficiencies along the directions where detectors are located. We present the design of a nonreciprocal scintillator using a one-dimensional magnetophotonic crystal in the Voigt configuration. Our work demonstrates the potential of controlling nonequilibrium emission such as scintillation by breaking reciprocity and expands the space of nanophotonic design for achieving such control.</description>

      <title>Optimization of a Microsphere-based Variable Density Multilayer Insulation System for Cryogenic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the standard composite insulation systems for cryogenic applications consists of a layer of hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) followed by a layer of variable density multilayer insulation (VDMLI) comprised of various internal combinations of reflectors and spacers. Microstructural effects of the HGM assembly and convection between the vessel and its surroundings are unaccounted for in existing calculations, which the current study incorporates in the unit cell-based HGM analytical model. Building on it, the insulation performance of the HGM layer with increasing thickness is studied for a Dewar insulation system containing liquid nitrogen (boiling point 78 K) based on pressures ranging from high vacuum (0.0133 Pa) to atmospheric (105 Pa) for two benchmark cryogenic vessel sizes. A suitable range of thickness for both systems is suggested. Further, the performance of four arithmetic progression-based VDMLI profiles in combination with an optimal HGM layer is studied. A VDMLI configuration with repeating spacer layers is found to perform best in high-pressure conditions. Finally, based on heat transfer performance within the given range of pressures and warm boundary temperatures up to 393 K, optimal thickness values of 120-130mm for the HGM layer and 125mm for the best VDMLI configuration are reported.</description>

      <title>Selective Passive Tuning of Cavity Resonance by Mode Index Engineering of the Partial Length of a Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavities in large-scale photonic integrated circuits often suffer from a wider distribution of resonance frequencies due to fabrication errors. It is crucial to adjust the resonances of cavities using post-processing methods to minimize the frequency distribution. We have developed a concept of passive tuning by manipulating the mode index of a portion of a microring cavity. Through analytical studies and numerical experiments, we have found that depositing a thin film of dielectric material on top of the cavity or etching the material enables us to fine-tune the resonances and minimize the frequency distribution. This versatile method allows for the selective tuning of each cavity's resonance in a large set of cavities in a single fabrication step, providing robust passive tuning in large-scale photonic integrated circuits. We show that proposed method achieves tuning resolution below 1/Q and range upto 10^3/Q for visible to near-infrared wavelengths. Furthermore, this method can be applied and explored in various optical cavities and material configurations.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Multimode Fiber Imaging and Characterization Under Thermal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF) imaging aided by machine learning holds promise for numerous applications, including medical endoscopy. A key challenge for this technology is the sensitivity of modal transmission characteristics to environmental perturbations. Here, we show experimentally that an MMF imaging scheme based on a neural network (NN) can achieve results that are significantly robust to thermal perturbations. For example, natural images are successfully reconstructed as the MMF's temperature is varied by up to 50$^{\circ}$C relative to the training scenario, despite substantial variations in the speckle patterns caused by thermal changes. A dense NN with a single hidden layer is found to outperform a convolutional NN suitable for standard computer vision tasks. In addition, we demonstrate that NN parameters can be used to understand the MMF properties by reconstructing the approximate transmission matrices, and we show that the image reconstruction accuracy is directly related to the temperature dependence of the MMF's transmission characteristics.</description>
