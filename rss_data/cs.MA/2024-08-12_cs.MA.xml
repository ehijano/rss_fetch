      <title>Performance Prediction of Hub-Based Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hub-based colony consists of multiple agents who share a common nest site called the hub. Agents perform tasks away from the hub like foraging for food or gathering information about future nest sites. Modeling hub-based colonies is challenging because the size of the collective state space grows rapidly as the number of agents grows. This paper presents a graph-based representation of the colony that can be combined with graph-based encoders to create low-dimensional representations of collective state that can scale to many agents for a best-of-N colony problem. We demonstrate how the information in the low-dimensional embedding can be used with two experiments. First, we show how the information in the tensor can be used to cluster collective states by the probability of choosing the best site for a very small problem. Second, we show how structured collective trajectories emerge when a graph encoder is used to learn the low-dimensional embedding, and these trajectories have information that can be used to predict swarm performance.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Cognitive Interaction Model of Instrument Operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel multi-agent, multi-scale computational cognitive interaction model of instrument operations at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). A leading scientific user facility, LCLS is the world's first hard x-ray free electron laser, operated by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. As the world's first x-ray free electron laser, LCLS is in high demand and heavily oversubscribed. Our overall project employs cognitive engineering methodologies to improve experimental efficiency and scientific productivity by refining experimental interfaces and workflows, simplifying tasks, reducing errors, and improving operator safety and stress levels. Our model simulates aspects of human cognition at multiple cognitive and temporal scales, ranging from seconds to hours, and among agents playing multiple roles, including instrument operator, real time data analyst, and experiment manager. The model can predict impacts stemming from proposed changes to operational interfaces and workflows. Because the model code is open source, and supplemental videos go into detail on all aspects of the model and results, this approach could be applied to other experimental apparatus and processes. Example results demonstrate the model's potential in guiding modifications to improve operational efficiency and scientific output. We discuss the implications of our findings for cognitive engineering in complex experimental settings and outline future directions for research.</description>

      <title>Performative Prediction on Games and Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictions often influence the reality which they aim to predict, an effect known as performativity. Existing work focuses on accuracy maximization under this effect, but model deployment may have important unintended impacts, especially in multiagent scenarios. In this work, we investigate performative prediction in a concrete game-theoretic setting where social welfare is an alternative objective to accuracy maximization. We explore a collective risk dilemma scenario where maximising accuracy can negatively impact social welfare, when predicting collective behaviours. By assuming knowledge of a Bayesian agent behavior model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs and use them for mechanism design.</description>

      <title>KAOS: Large Model Multi-Agent Operating System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intelligent interaction model based on large models reduces the differences in user experience across various system platforms but faces challenges in multi-agent collaboration and resource sharing. To demonstrate a uniform user experience across different foundational software platforms and address resource coordination management challenges, this paper proposes KAOS, a multi-agent operating system based on the open-source Kylin. The research method involves empowering agents with large models to serve applications. First, by introducing management role agents and vertical multi-agent collaboration to construct or replace typical application software. Second, by studying system-level shared resource scheduling strategies to enhance user experience and optimize resource utilization. And finally, by validating the efficiency and superiority of the large model multi-agent operating system through real applications and scoring intelligence. The feasibility of this system is demonstrated, providing a new perspective for the development of multi-agent operating systems. Experimental results show significant advantages of multi-agent collaboration in various application scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Crowd-Aware Multi-Agent Path Finding through Local Communication with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) in crowded environments presents a challenging problem in motion planning, aiming to find collision-free paths for all agents in the system. MAPF finds a wide range of applications in various domains, including aerial swarms, autonomous warehouse robotics, and self-driving vehicles. Current approaches to MAPF generally fall into two main categories: centralized and decentralized planning. Centralized planning suffers from the curse of dimensionality when the number of agents or states increases and thus does not scale well in large and complex environments. On the other hand, decentralized planning enables agents to engage in real-time path planning within a partially observable environment, demonstrating implicit coordination. However, they suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dense environments. In this paper, we introduce CRAMP, a novel crowd-aware decentralized reinforcement learning approach to address this problem by enabling efficient local communication among agents via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), facilitating situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in congested environments. We test CRAMP on simulated environments and demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art decentralized methods for MAPF on various metrics. CRAMP improves the solution quality up to 59% measured in makespan and collision count, and up to 35% improvement in success rate in comparison to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Fast Peer Adaptation with Context-aware Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast adapting to unknown peers (partners or opponents) with different strategies is a key challenge in multi-agent games. To do so, it is crucial for the agent to probe and identify the peer's strategy efficiently, as this is the prerequisite for carrying out the best response in adaptation. However, exploring the strategies of unknown peers is difficult, especially when the games are partially observable and have a long horizon. In this paper, we propose a peer identification reward, which rewards the learning agent based on how well it can identify the behavior pattern of the peer over the historical context, such as the observation over multiple episodes. This reward motivates the agent to learn a context-aware policy for effective exploration and fast adaptation, i.e., to actively seek and collect informative feedback from peers when uncertain about their policies and to exploit the context to perform the best response when confident. We evaluate our method on diverse testbeds that involve competitive (Kuhn Poker), cooperative (PO-Overcooked), or mixed (Predator-Prey-W) games with peer agents. We demonstrate that our method induces more active exploration behavior, achieving faster adaptation and better outcomes than existing methods.</description>
