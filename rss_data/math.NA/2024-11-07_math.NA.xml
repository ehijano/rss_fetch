      <title>A robust first order meshfree method for time-dependent nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a robust first order accurate meshfree method to numerically solve time-dependent nonlinear conservation laws. The main contribution of this work is the meshfree construction of first order consistent summation by parts differentiations. We describe how to efficiently construct such operators on a point cloud. We then study the performance of such differentiations, and then combine these operators with a numerical flux-based formulation to approximate the solution of nonlinear conservation laws, with focus on the advection equation and the compressible Euler equations. We observe numerically that, while the resulting mesh-free differentiation operators are only $O(h^\frac{1}{2})$ accurate in the $L^2$ norm, they achieve $O(h)$ rates of convergence when applied to the numerical solution of PDEs.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods for spectroscopy data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable Bayesian framework for the analysis of confocal fluorescence spectroscopy data, addressing key limitations in traditional fluorescence correlation spectroscopy methods. Our framework captures molecular motion, microscope optics, and photon detection with high fidelity, enabling statistical inference of molecule trajectories from raw photon count data, introducing a superresolution parameter which further enhances trajectory estimation beyond the native time resolution of data acquisition. To handle the high dimensionality of the arising posterior distribution, we develop a family of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms that leverages the unique characteristics inherent to spectroscopy data analysis. Here, due to the highly-coupled correlation structure of the target posterior distribution, HMC requires the numerical solution of a stiff ordinary differential equation containing a two-scale discrete Laplacian. By considering the spectral properties of this operator, we produce a CFL-type integrator stability condition for the standard St\"ormer-Verlet integrator used in HMC. To circumvent this instability we introduce a semi-implicit (IMEX) method which treats the stiff and non-stiff parts differently, while leveraging the sparse structure of the discrete Laplacian for computational efficiency. Detailed numerical experiments demonstrate that this method improves upon fully explicit approaches, allowing larger HMC step sizes and maintaining second-order accuracy in position and energy. Our framework provides a foundation for extensions to more complex models such as surface constrained molecular motion or motion with multiple diffusion modes.</description>

      <title>Spectral Transformation for the Dense Symmetric Semidefinite Generalized Eigenvalue Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral transformation Lanczos method for the sparse symmetric definite generalized eigenvalue problem for matrices $A$ and $B$ is an iterative method that addresses the case of semidefinite or ill conditioned $B$ using a shifted and inverted formulation of the problem. This paper proposes the same approach for dense problems and shows that with a shift chosen in accordance with certain constraints, the algorithm can conditionally ensure that every computed shifted and inverted eigenvalue is close to the exact shifted and inverted eigenvalue of a pair of matrices close to $A$ and $B$. Under the same assumptions on the shift, the analysis of the algorithm for the shifted and inverted problem leads to useful error bounds for the original problem, including a bound that shows how a single shift that is of moderate size in a scaled sense can be chosen so that every computed generalized eigenvalue corresponds to a generalized eigenvalue of a pair of matrices close to $A$ and $B$. The computed generalized eigenvectors give a relative residual that depends on the distance between the corresponding generalized eigenvalue and the shift. If the shift is of moderate size, then relative residuals are small for generalized eigenvalues that are not much larger than the shift. Larger shifts give small relative residuals for generalized eigenvalues that are not much larger or smaller than the shift.</description>

      <title>Upper bound of high-order derivatives for Wachspress coordinates on polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient bounds of generalized barycentric coordinates play an essential role in the $H^1$ norm approximation error estimate of generalized barycentric interpolations. Similarly, the $H^k$ norm, $k&gt;1$, estimate needs upper bounds of high-order derivatives, which are not available in the literature. In this paper, we derive such upper bounds for the Wachspress generalized barycentric coordinates on simple convex $d$-dimensional polytopes, $d\ge 1$. The result can be used to prove optimal convergence for Wachspress-based polytopal finite element approximation of, for example, fourth-order elliptic equations.
  Another contribution of this paper is to compare various shape-regularity conditions for simple convex polytopes, and to clarify their relations using knowledge from convex geometry.</description>

      <title>An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, highly efficient, second-order accurate, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models that are of importance in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in the sense that only a (fixed) symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right hand sides) is involved at each time-step. The solutions to the scheme are uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme is able to capture the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors as well as the invariant measures of the scheme converge to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero. In our numerical experiments, we take an indirect approach, using long-term statistics to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first order using the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order using the L1 metric. This implies that very long time simulation is needed in order to capture a few significant digits of long time statistics (climate) correct. Nevertheless, the second order scheme's performance remains superior to that of the first order one, requiring significantly less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo for partial differential equations with generalized Gaussian input uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in uncertainty quantification for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) with Gevrey regular inputs. The Gevrey class contains functions that are infinitely smooth with a growth condition on the higher-order partial derivatives, but which are nonetheless not analytic in general. Recent studies by Chernov and Le (Comput. Math. Appl., 2024, and SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2024) as well as Harbrecht, Schmidlin, and Schwab (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 2024) analyze the setting wherein the input random field is assumed to be uniformly bounded with respect to the uncertain parameters. In this paper, we relax this assumption and allow for parameter-dependent bounds. The parametric inputs are modeled as generalized Gaussian random variables, and we analyze the application of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration to assess the PDE response statistics using randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules. In addition to the QMC error analysis, we also consider the dimension truncation and finite element errors in this setting.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Spectral Element Tensor Network Approach for Time Dependent Convection Diffusion Reaction Equation with Variable Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new space-time Petrov-Galerkin-like method. This method utilizes a mixed formulation of Tensor Train (TT) and Quantized Tensor Train (QTT), designed for the spectral element discretization (Q1-SEM) of the time-dependent convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equation. We reformulate the assembly process of the spectral element discretized CDR to enhance its compatibility with tensor operations and introduce a low-rank tensor structure for the spectral element operators. Recognizing the banded structure inherent in the spectral element framework's discrete operators, we further exploit the QTT format of the CDR to achieve greater speed and compression. Additionally, we present a comprehensive approach for integrating variable coefficients of CDR into the global discrete operators within the TT/QTT framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of memory efficiency and computational complexity, is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments, including a semi-linear example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) numerically by using (possibly random) neural networks in the truncated Wiener chaos expansion of their corresponding solution. Moreover, we provide some approximation rates for learning the solution of SPDEs with additive and/or multiplicative noise. Finally, we apply our results in numerical examples to approximate the solution of three SPDEs: the stochastic heat equation, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation, and the Zakai equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes open-source scientific contributions in python surrounding the numerical solutions to hyperbolic Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equations viz., their implicit representation on co-dimension one surfaces; dynamics evolution with levelsets; spatial derivatives; total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta integration schemes; and their applications to the theory of reachable sets. They are increasingly finding applications in multiple research domains such as reinforcement learning, robotics, control engineering and automation. We describe the library components, illustrate usage with an example, and provide comparisons with existing implementations. This GPU-accelerated package allows for easy portability to many modern libraries for the numerical analyses of the HJ equations. We also provide a CPU implementation in python that is significantly faster than existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Deriving Analytical Solutions Using Symbolic Matrix Structural Analysis: Part 1 -- Continuous Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the use of symbolic computation in Matrix Structural Analysis (MSA) for continuous beams, leveraging the MATLAB Symbolic Math Toolbox. By employing symbolic MSA, analytical expressions for displacements, support reactions, and internal forces are derived, offering deeper insights into structural behavior. This approach facilitates efficient and scalable sensitivity analysis, where partial derivatives of outputs concerning input parameters can be directly computed, enhancing design exploration. The development includes an open-source MATLAB program, hosted on GitHub, enabling symbolic analysis of continuous beams subjected to point and uniform loads. This approach is invaluable for both engineering practice and pedagogy, enriching the understanding of structural mechanics and aiding in education by illustrating clear parameter relationships. The program supports deriving influence lines and identifying maximum response values.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving quantum algorithms for linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are fundamental across modern science and engineering, appearing in models that span virtually all physical scales. A critical property for the robustness and stability of computational methods in such systems is the symplectic structure, which preserves geometric properties like phase-space volume over time and energy conservation over an extended period. In this paper, we present quantum algorithms that incorporate symplectic integrators, ensuring the preservation of this key structure. We demonstrate how these algorithms maintain the symplectic properties for both linear and nonlinear Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the computational complexity, showing that our approach offers both accuracy and improved efficiency over classical algorithms. These results highlight the potential application of quantum algorithms for solving large-scale Hamiltonian systems while preserving essential physical properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an existence result for the steady state flow of gas mixtures on networks. The basis of the model are the physical principles of the isothermal Euler equation, coupling conditions for the flow and pressure, and the mixing of incoming flow at nodes. The state equation is based on a convex combination of the ideal gas equations of state for natural gas and hydrogen. We analyze mathematical properties of the model allowing us to prove the existence of solutions in particular for tree-shaped networks and networks with exactly one cycle. Numerical examples illustrate the results and explore the applicability of our approach to different network topologies.</description>

      <title>Inexact block LU preconditioners for incompressible fluids with flow rate conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When studying the dynamics of incompressible fluids in bounded domains the only available data often provide average flow rate conditions on portions of the domain's boundary. In engineering applications a common practice to complete these conditions is to prescribe a Dirichlet condition by assuming a-priori a spatial profile for the velocity field. However, this strongly influence the accuracy of the numerical solution. A more mathematically sound approach is to prescribe the flow rate conditions using Lagrange multipliers, resulting in an augmented weak formulation of the Navier-Stokes problem.
  In this paper we start from the SIMPLE preconditioner, introduced so far for the standard Navier-Stokes equations, and we derive two preconditioners for the monolithic solution of the augmented problem. This can be useful in complex applications where splitting the computation of the velocity/pressure and Lagrange multipliers numerical solutions can be very expensive. In particular, we investigate the numerical performance of the preconditioners in both idealized and real-life scenarios. Finally, we highlight the advantages of treating flow rate conditions with a Lagrange multipliers approach instead of prescribing a Dirichlet condition.</description>

      <title>Toward end-to-end quantum simulation for protein dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and simulating the protein folding process overall remains a grand challenge in computational biology. We systematically investigate end-to-end quantum algorithms for simulating various protein dynamics with effects, such as mechanical forces or stochastic noises. We offer efficient quantum simulation algorithms to produce quantum encoding of the final states, history states, or density matrices of inhomogeneous or stochastic harmonic oscillator models. For the read-in setting, we design (i) efficient quantum algorithms for initial state preparation, utilizing counter-based random number generator and rejection sampling, and (ii) depth-efficient approaches for molecular structure loading. Both are particularly important in handling large protein molecules. For the read-out setting, our algorithms estimate various classical observables, such as energy, low vibration modes, density of states, correlation of displacement, and optimal control of molecular dynamics. We also show classical numerical experiments focused on estimating the density of states and applying the optimal control to facilitate conformation changes to verify our arguments on potential quantum speedups. Overall, our study demonstrates that the quantum simulation of protein dynamics can be a solid end-to-end application in the era of early or fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Tensor train solution to uncertain optimization problems with shared sparsity penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop both first and second order numerical optimization methods to solve non-smooth optimization problems featuring a shared sparsity penalty, constrained by differential equations with uncertainty. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality we use tensor product approximations. To handle the non-smoothness of the objective function we introduce a smoothed version of the shared sparsity objective. We consider both a benchmark elliptic PDE constraint, and a more realistic topology optimization problem. We demonstrate that the error converges linearly in iterations and the smoothing parameter, and faster than algebraically in the number of degrees of freedom, consisting of the number of quadrature points in one variable and tensor ranks. Moreover, in the topology optimization problem, the smoothed shared sparsity penalty actually reduces the tensor ranks compared to the unpenalised solution. This enables us to find a sparse high-resolution design under a high-dimensional uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Laplace transform based quantum eigenvalue transformation via linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenvalue transformations, which include solving time-dependent differential equations as a special case, have a wide range of applications in scientific and engineering computation. While quantum algorithms for singular value transformations are well studied, eigenvalue transformations are distinct, especially for non-normal matrices. We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for performing a class of eigenvalue transformations that can be expressed as a certain type of matrix Laplace transformation. This allows us to significantly extend the recently developed linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method [An, Liu, Lin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603, 2023; An, Childs, Lin, arXiv:2312.03916] to represent a wider class of eigenvalue transformations, such as powers of the matrix inverse, $A^{-k}$, and the exponential of the matrix inverse, $e^{-A^{-1}}$. The latter can be interpreted as the solution of a mass-matrix differential equation of the form $A u'(t)=-u(t)$. We demonstrate that our eigenvalue transformation approach can solve this problem without explicitly inverting $A$, reducing the computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the numerical approximation for the invariant distribution of Markovian switching L\'evy-driven stochastic differential equations. By combining the tamed-adaptive Euler-Maruyama scheme with the Multi-level Monte Carlo method, we propose an approximation scheme that can be applied to stochastic differential equations with super-linear growth drift and diffusion coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We obtain Marcinkiewicz--ygmund (MZ) inequalities in various Banach and quasi-Banach spaces under minimal assumptions on the structural properties of these spaces. Our main results show that the Bernstein inequality in a general quasi-Banach function lattice $X$ implies Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund type estimates in $X$. We present a general approach to obtain MZ inequalities not only for polynomials but for other function classes including entire functions of exponential type, splines, exponential sums, etc.</description>

      <title>$hp$-Version space-time discontinuous Galerkin methods for parabolic problems on prismatic meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.01212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new $hp$-version space-time discontinuous Galerkin (dG) finite element method for the numerical approximation of parabolic evolution equations on general spatial meshes consisting of polygonal/polyhedral (polytopic) elements, giving rise to prismatic space-time elements. A key feature of the proposed method is the use of space-time elemental polynomial bases of \emph{total} degree, say $p$, defined in the physical coordinate system, as opposed to standard dG-time-stepping methods whereby spatial elemental bases are tensorized with temporal basis functions. This approach leads to a fully discrete $hp$-dG scheme using less degrees of freedom for each time step, compared to standard dG time-stepping schemes employing tensorized space-time, with acceptable deterioration of the approximation properties. A second key feature of the new space-time dG method is the incorporation of very general spatial meshes consisting of possibly polygonal/polyhedral elements with \emph{arbitrary} number of faces. A priori error bounds are shown for the proposed method in various norms. An extensive comparison among the new space-time dG method, the (standard) tensorized space-time dG methods, the classical dG-time-stepping, and conforming finite element method in space, is presented in a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Numerical Algorithms for Harmonic Maps into the Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark methods for computing harmonic maps into the unit sphere, with particular focus on harmonic maps with singularities. For the discretization we compare two different approaches, both based on Lagrange finite elements. While the first method enforces the unit-length constraint only at the Lagrange nodes, the other one adds a pointwise projection to fulfill the constraint everywhere. For the solution of the resulting algebraic problems we compare a nonconforming gradient flow with a Riemannian trust-region method. Both are energy-decreasing and can be shown to converge globally to stationary points of the discretized Dirichlet energy. We observe that while the nonconforming and the conforming discretizations both show similar behavior for smooth problems, the nonconforming discretization handles singularities better. On the solver side, the second-order trust-region method converges after few steps, whereas the number of gradient-flow steps increases proportionally to the inverse grid element diameter.</description>

      <title>Nearly Optimal Approximation of Matrix Functions by the Lanczos Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximating the action of a matrix function $f(\mathbf{A})$ on a vector $\mathbf{b}$ is an increasingly important primitive in machine learning, data science, and statistics, with applications such as sampling high dimensional Gaussians, Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference, principle component analysis, and approximating Hessian spectral densities. Over the past decade, a number of algorithms enjoying strong theoretical guarantees have been proposed for this task. Many of the most successful belong to a family of algorithms called Krylov subspace methods. Remarkably, a classic Krylov subspace method, called the Lanczos method for matrix functions (Lanczos-FA), frequently outperforms newer methods in practice. Our main result is a theoretical justification for this finding: we show that, for a natural class of rational functions, Lanczos-FA matches the error of the best possible Krylov subspace method up to a multiplicative approximation factor. The approximation factor depends on the degree of $f(x)$'s denominator and the condition number of $\mathbf{A}$, but not on the number of iterations $k$. Our result provides a strong justification for the excellent performance of Lanczos-FA, especially on functions that are well approximated by rationals, such as the matrix square root.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of Discontinuous Galerkin methods, we study approximations of nonlinear variational problems associated with convex energies. We propose element-wise nonconforming finite element methods to discretize the continuous minimisation problem. Using $\Gamma$-convergence arguments we show that the discrete minimisers converge to the unique minimiser of the continuous problem as the mesh parameter tends to zero, under the additional contribution of appropriately defined penalty terms at the level of the discrete energies. We finally substantiate the feasibility of our methods by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Scalable Approximate Optimal Diagonal Preconditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the optimal diagonal preconditioner for a positive definite matrix. Although this problem has been shown to be solvable and various methods have been proposed, none of the existing approaches are scalable to matrices of large dimension, or when access is limited to black-box matrix-vector products, thereby significantly limiting their practical application. In view of these challenges, we propose practical algorithms applicable to finding approximate optimal diagonal preconditioners of large sparse systems. Our approach is based on the idea of dimension reduction, and combines techniques from semi-definite programming (SDP), random projection, semi-infinite programming (SIP), and column generation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method scales to sparse matrices of size greater than $10^7$. Notably, our approach is efficient and implementable using only black-box matrix-vector product operations, making it highly practical for a wide variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Projected Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms in non-convex and super-linear setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is of significant interest in many applications to sample from a high-dimensional target distribution $\pi$ with the density $\pi(\text{d} x) \propto e^{-U(x)} (\text{d} x) $, based on the temporal discretization of the Langevin stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this paper, we propose an explicit projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) algorithm with non-convex potential $U$ and super-linear gradient of $U$ and investigate the non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in total variation distance. Equipped with time-independent regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation, we derive the non-asymptotic bounds on the total variation distance between the target distribution of the Langevin SDEs and the law induced by the PLMC scheme with order $\mathcal{O}(d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}} h |\ln h|)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the target distribution and $\gamma \geq 1$ characterizes the growth of the gradient of $U$. In addition, if the gradient of $U$ is globally Lipschitz continuous, an improved convergence order of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} h)$ for the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme is derived with a refinement of the proof based on Malliavin calculus techniques. To achieve a given precision $\epsilon$, the smallest number of iterations of the PLMC algorithm is proved to be of order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}}}{\epsilon} \ \cdot \ln (\tfrac{d}{\epsilon}) \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. In particular, the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme with the non-convex potential $U$ and the globally Lipschitz gradient of $U$ can be guaranteed by order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{3/2}}{\epsilon} \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A mean correction for improved phase-averaging accuracy in oscillatory, multiscale, differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new algorithm to improve the accuracy of numerical phase-averaging in oscillatory, multiscale, differential equations. Phase-averaging is a timestepping method which averages a mapped variable to remove highly oscillatory linear terms from the differential equation. This retains the main contribution of fast waves on the low frequencies without explicitly resolving the rapid oscillations. However, this comes at the cost of introducing an averaging error. To offset this, we propose a modified mapping that includes a mean correction term encoding an average measure of the nonlinear interactions. This mapping was introduced in Tao (2019) for weak nonlinearity and relied on classical time-averaging, which leaves only the zero frequencies. Our algorithm instead considers mean corrected phase-averaging when 1) the nonlinearity is not weak but the linear oscillations are fast and 2) finite averaging windows are applied via a smooth kernel, which has the advantage of retaining low frequencies whilst still eliminating the fastest oscillations. In particular, we introduce a local mean correction that combines the concepts of a mean correction and finite averaging; this retains low-frequency components in the mean correction that are removed with classical time-averaging. We show that the new timestepping algorithm reduces phase errors in the mapped variable for the swinging spring ODE in various dynamical configurations. We also show accuracy improvements with a local mean correction compared to standard phase-averaging in the one-dimensional rotating shallow water equations, a useful test case for weather and climate applications.</description>

      <title>A variational discretization method for mean curvature flows by the Onsager principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean curvature flow describes the evolution of a surface (a curve) with normal velocity proportional to the local mean curvature. It has many applications in mathematics, science and engineering. In this paper, we develop a numerical method for mean curvature flows by using the Onsager principle as an approximation tool. We first show that the mean curvature flow can be derived naturally from the Onsager variational principle. Then we consider a piecewise linear approximation of the curve and derive a discrete geometric flow. The discrete flow is described by a system of ordinary differential equations for the nodes of the discrete curve. We prove that the discrete system preserve the energy dissipation structure in the framework of the Onsager principle and this implies the energy decreasing property. The ODE system can be solved by the improved Euler scheme and this leads to an efficient fully discrete scheme. We first consider the method for a simple mean curvature flow and then extend it to the volume preserving mean curvature flow and also a wetting problem on substrates. Numerical examples show that the method has optimal convergence rate and works well for all the three problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Preserving Linearly Implicit Additive IMEX-RK Finite Volume Schemes for Low Mach Number Isentropic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics with isentropic equation of state. Standard numerical schemes for the Euler equations suffer from stability and accuracy issues in the low Mach regime. These failures are attributed to the transitional behaviour of the governing equations from compressible to incompressible solution in the limit of vanishing Mach number. In this paper we introduce an extra flux term to the momentum flux. This extra term is recognised by looking at the constraints of the incompressible limit system. As a consequence the flux terms enable us to get a suitable splitting, so that an additive IMEX-RK scheme could be applied. Using an elliptic reformulation the scheme boils down to just solving a linear elliptic problem for the density and then explicit updates for the momentum. The IMEX schemes developed are shown to be formally asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit of the Euler equations and are shown to be linearly $L^2$ stable. A second order space time fully discrete scheme is obtained in the finite volume framework using a combination of Rusanov flux for the explicit part and simple central differences for the implicit part. Results of numerical case studies are reported which elucidate the theoretical assertions regarding the scheme and its robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a multimodal distribution is a fundamental and challenging problem in computational science and statistics. Among various approaches proposed for this task, one popular method is Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based version of AIS by combining it with population-based Monte Carlo methods to improve its efficiency. By keeping track of an ensemble instead of a single particle along some continuation path between the starting distribution and the target distribution, we take advantage of the interaction within the ensemble to encourage the exploration of undiscovered modes. Specifically, our main idea is to utilize either the snooker algorithm or the genetic algorithm used in Evolutionary Monte Carlo. We discuss how the proposed algorithm can be implemented and derive a partial differential equation governing the evolution of the ensemble under the continuous time and mean-field limit. We also test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on various continuous and discrete distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of electromagnetic devices with complex geometries and large-scale discrete systems benefits from advanced computational methods like IsoGeometric Analysis and Domain Decomposition. In this paper, we employ both concepts in an Isogeometric Tearing and Interconnecting method to enable the use of parallel computations for magnetostatic problems. We address the underlying non-uniqueness by using a graph-theoretic approach, the tree-cotree decomposition. The classical tree-cotree gauging is adapted to be feasible for parallelization, which requires that all local subsystems are uniquely solvable. Our contribution consists of an explicit algorithm for constructing compatible trees and combining it with a dual-primal approach to enable parallelization. The correctness of the proposed approach is proved and verified by numerical experiments, showing its accuracy, scalability and optimal convergence.</description>
