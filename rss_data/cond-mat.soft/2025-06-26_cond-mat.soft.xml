      <title>Static friction of liquid marbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid marbles, droplets coated with a granular layer, are highly mobile as particles prevent capillary adhesion with the substrate. Yet, they exhibit static friction due to their granular shell, which resists rolling until it yields. This friction depends on the shell geometry and increases exponentially with grain density, indicating a logistic dependence of interparticle compressive forces on surface coverage, confirmed by yielding measurements in granular rafts. These results reveal the shell's dual role, and establish liquid marbles as a model system for probing granular raft mechanics.</description>

      <title>Strong thermoelectric response of nanoconfined weak electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dissolved, weak electrolytes only partially dissociate into ions in a temperature-dependent process. We show herein that such incomplete dissociation yields an enormous thermoelectric response in an electrolyte-filled nanochannel along which a temperature gradient is applied. For this purpose, an extended version of the Nernst-Planck equations is developed that takes into account the temperature-dependent dissociation-association equilibrium. The results indicate that in this way, Seebeck coefficients can be achieved that outperform all previously reported values.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of Chiral Active Brownian Particles at Low Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral active matter is a variant of active matter systems in which the motion of the constituent particles violates mirror symmetry. In this letter, we simulate two-dimensional chiral Active Brownian Particles, the simplest chiral model in which each particle undergoes circular motion, and show that the system crystallizes at low densities well below the melting point of the equilibrium counterpart. Crystallization is only possible if the orbital radius is long enough to align the circulating particles, but short enough for neighboring particles to avoid collisions. Of course, the system must be driven sufficiently far from equilibrium, since chirality cannot affect thermodynamic properties in classical equilibrium systems. The fluid-crystal phase diagram shows a re-entrant melting transition as a function of the radius of the circles. We show that at least one of the two transitions follows the same two-step melting scenario as in equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Shape-determined kinetic pathways in two-dimensional solid-solid phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-solid phase transitions are ubiquitous in nature, but the kinetic pathway of anisotropic particle systems remains elusive, where the coupling between translational and rotational motions plays a critical role in various kinetic processes. Here we investigate this problem by molecular dynamics simulation for two-dimensional ball-stick polygon systems, where pentagon, hexagon, and octagon systems all undergo an isostructural solid-solid phase transition. During heating, the translational motion exhibits merely a homogeneous expansion, whereas the time evolution of body-orientation is shape-determined. The local defects of body-orientation self-organize into a vague stripe for pentagon, a random pattern for hexagon, while a distinct stripe for octagon. The underlying kinetic pathway of octagon satisfies the quasi-equilibrium assumption, while that of hexagon and pentagon is dominated by translational motion and by rotational motion, respectively. This diversity is originated from different kinetic coupling modes determined by the anisotropy of molecules, and can affect the phase transition rates. The reverse process in terms of cooling follows the same mechanism, but the kinetic pathways are more diverse attributed to the possible kinetic traps. Our findings not only promote the theoretical understanding of microscopic kinetics of solid-solid phase transitions but also provide direct guidance for the rational design of materials utilizing desired kinetic features.</description>

      <title>On the temperature of an active nematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a novel hydrodynamic framework for active matter coupled to an environment to study the local temperature of an active nematic, assuming proximity to thermal equilibrium. We show that, due to the mechanosensitivity of fuel consumption, linearized temperature correlations in a homogeneous active nematic steady state remain unaffected by activity. However, we demonstrate that local shearing and twisting cause a confined active nematic undergoing a spontaneous flow transition to develop a distinctive inhomogeneous temperature profile, serving as a thermal signature of activity.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport characteristics of impinging ferrofluid droplets in the presence of a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena and hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While the impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates are well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly those influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields, remains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid droplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid, enabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic forces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force within the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior and, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the contact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to enhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force effectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These critical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of the induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of thermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions of magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within the multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of Weber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat transfer characteristics.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Periodic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium propagation provides an exact method to compute the gradient of a cost function from the response to external forcing. These algorithms, in conjunction with local updates to the system parameters, may enable mechanical and electronic systems to autonomously acquire complex functionality. We extend these methods to damped dynamical systems operating in the linear regime by introducing an effective action, whose extremum corresponds to the periodic steady state. The condition of applicability is that the response function is symmetric, which is fulfilled by damped Newtonian dynamics and RLC networks. We demonstrate the viability of our method in those systems and explore novel functionality such as classifying temporal sound signals. Our work opens the door to intelligent materials that process dynamical signals, enabling temporal computations, passive and active sensors, and materials that act as frequency-dependent filters.</description>

      <title>Depinning and activated motion of chiral self-propelled robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study experimentally, numerically and analytically, the dynamics of a chiral active particle (cm-sized robots), pulled at a constant translational velocity. We show that the system can be mapped to a Brownian particle driven across a periodic potential landscape, and thus exhibits a rotational depinning transition in the noiseless limit, giving rise to a creep regime in the presence of rotational diffusion. We show that a simple model of chiral, self-aligning, active particles accurately describes such dynamics. The steady-state distribution and escape times from local potential barriers, corresponding to long-lived orientations of the particles, can be computed exactly within the model and is in excellent agreement with both experiments and particle-based simulations, with no fitting parameters. Our work thus consolidates such self-propelled robots as a model system for the study of chiral active matter, and highlights the interesting dynamics arising from the interplay between external and internal driving forces in the presence of a self-aligning torque.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Morphological Evolution of Neuronal Dendrites by First-Passage Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A high degree of structural complexity arises in dynamic neuronal dendrites due to extensive branching patterns and diverse spine morphologies, which enable the nervous system to adjust function, construct complex input pathways and thereby enhance the computational power of the system. Owing to the determinant role of dendrite morphology in the functionality of the nervous system, recognition of pathological changes due to neurodegenerative disorders is of crucial importance. We show that the statistical analysis of a temporary signal generated by cargos that have diffusively passed through the complex dendritic structure yields vital information about dendrite morphology. As a feasible scenario, we propose engineering mRNA-carrying multilamellar liposomes to diffusively reach the soma and release mRNAs, which are translated into a specific protein upon encountering ribosomes. The concentration of this protein over a large population of neurons can be externally measured, as a detectable temporary signal. Using a stochastic coarse-grained approach for first-passage through dendrites, we connect the key morphological properties affected by neurodegenerative diseases -- including the density and size of spines, the extent of the tree, and the segmental increase of dendrite diameter towards soma -- to the characteristics of the evolving signal. Thus, we establish a direct link between the dendrite morphology and the statistical characteristics of the detectable signal. Our approach provides a fast noninvasive measurement technique to indirectly extract vital information about the morphological evolution of dendrites in the course of neurodegenerative disease progression.</description>

      <title>Two apparently different interfacial stress formulations constructed from the diffuse interface free energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. Confusingly, these two apparently different formulations both have been widely used for the same purpose without much attention in the difference. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress and the former represents the stress due to the non-equilibrium irreversible process in the fluid. The formulations are analyzed not only for the one-component fluid but also for the multi-component fluid. In the prediction of the incompressible flow of one-component fluids, the two formulations turn out to give the identical velocity field, but not the pressure field even in this case.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the embedded states of a fluorescent probe within a lipid bilayer using molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physicochemical properties of lipid bilayers (membranes) are closely associated with various cellular functions and are often evaluated using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. For instance, by employing fluorescent probes that exhibit spectra reflective of the surrounding membrane environment, one can estimate the membrane polarity. Thus, elucidating how such probes are embedded within the membranes would be beneficial for enabling a deeper interpretation of the spectra. Here, we apply molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with an enhanced sampling method to investigate the embedded state of 6-propionyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (Prodan) within a membrane composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), as well as its variation upon the addition of ethanol as a cosolvent to the aqueous phase. In the absence of ethanol, it is found that the bulky moieties of Prodan (propionyl and dimethylamine groups) prefer to be oriented toward the membrane center owing to the voids existing near the center. The structural change in the membrane induced by the addition of ethanol causes a reduction in the void population near the center, resulting in a diminished orientation preference of Prodan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We proposed a new extended version of Enskog theory for the description of the self-diffusion coefficient of a colloidal hard-sphere fluid adsorbed in a matrix of disordered hard-sphere obstacles. In a considered approach instead of contact values of the fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution functions, we introduced by input the new functions that include the dependence on the fraction of the volume free from matrix particles and from fluid particles trapped by matrix particles. It is shown that the introduction of this free volume fraction by the Fermi-like distribution leads to the best agreement between theoretical predictions and computer simulation results [Chang R., Jagannathan K., Yethiraj A., Phys. Rev. E, 2004, 69, 051101].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlation functions in concentrated ionic systems are studied within the mesoscopic theory at the level of the Gaussian approximation. The previously neglected fluctuation contribution to the inverse charge-charge correlation function is taken into account to verify the accuracy of the previous results. We calculate the correlation lengths and the amplitudes and show that the fluctuation contribution does not lead to significant changes of the results. We also derive necessary conditions for the presence of both, the oscillatory and the monotonic decays of the charge-charge correlations that must be satisfied by the noncoulombic contributions to the inverse charge-charge correlation function. At the level of the Gaussian approximation, these conditions are not satisfied. Extension of the theory beyond the Gaussian approximation is necessary to verify whether the asymptotic decay of the charge-charge correlations is monotonous or oscillatory, as suggested by the surface force apparatus or by the SAXS experiments, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applications of 3D-RISM-KH molecular solvation theory range from solvation energy of small molecules to phase behavior of polymers and biomolecules. It predicts the molecular mechanisms of chemical and biomolecular systems. Replica RISM-KH-VM molecular solvation theory predicts and explains the structure, thermodynamics, and electrochemistry of electrolyte solutions sorbed in a nanoporous material. It was tested on nanoporous carbon supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte and nanoporous electrosorption cells. The mechanisms in these systems are steered by the electric double layer potential drop across the Stern layer at the nanopores surface and the Gouy-Chapman layer averaged over the nanoporous material, the osmotic term due to the ionic concentrations difference in the two nanoporous electrodes and in the electrolyte solution outside, and the solvation chemical potentials of sorbed ions averaged over the nanoporous material. The latter strongly depends on chemical specificity of ions, solvent, surface functional groups, and steric effects for solvated ions confined in nanopores.</description>

      <title>Liquid-gas state regularities as a manifestation of global isomorphism with the Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid-gas equilibrium is considered using the global isomorphism with the Ising-like (lattice gas) model. Such an approach assumes the existence of the order parameter in terms of which the symmetry of binodal is restored not only in the vicinity of the critical point (critical isomorphism) but also globally in the whole coexistence region. We show how the empirical law of the rectilinear density diameter of the liquid-gas binodal allows us to derive a rather simple form of the isomorphism transformation between the fluid and lattice gas model of Ising-type. The relations for critical parameters which follow from such isomorphism are tested on a variety of fluid systems, both real and model ones. Moreover, we consider the phase equilibrium in polymer solutions and the Flory $\theta$-point as the extreme state of such equilibrium within our approach. The most crucial testing in 2D case is using the Onsager exact solution of the Ising model, and we represent the results of our approach to the calculation of critical point parameters of monolayers for noble gases and the surface tension.</description>

Abstract: The density functional approach for classical associating fluids is used to explore the wetting phase diagrams for model systems consisting of water and graphite-like solid surfaces chemically modified by a small amount of grafted chain molecules. The water-like fluid model is adopted from the work of Clark et al. [Mol. Phys., 104, 3561 (2006)]. It very well describes the bulk water vapor-liquid coexistence. Each chain molecule consists of tangentially bonded hard sphere segments. We focus on the investigation of the growth of water film on such complex substrates and exploration of the wetting behavior. For grafted monomers, the prewetting phase diagrams are similar to the diagrams for water on a non-modified solid surface. However, for grafted trimers and pentamers, a physically much richer behavior is observed and analyzed. Trends of the behavior of the wetting temperature and the prewetting critical temperature on the grafting density and water-segments attraction are discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>Statistical theory of charged particle systems including triple bound states -- and the Collaboration Lviv-Rostock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Honoring the hundredth anniversary of the birthday of Ihor R. Yuknovskii we analyze new developments in the statistical thermodynamics of Coulomb systems. The basic idea of this work is to demonstrate that the exponential potential used in the first papers of Yukhnovskii is an appropriate reference system for a description of classical and quantum charged particle systems. We briefly discuss the collaboration between the groups of Ihor R. Yuknovskii in Lviv and G\"unter Kelbg in Rostock and analyze several approaches based on pair correlation functions and cluster expansion in the classical as well as in the quantum case. Finally, we discuss the progress in the statistical description of bound states of three particles as in helium plasmas and in MgCl$_2$-solutions in the classical case and present new results regarding the influence of three-particle bound states. In particular, we give new expressions for the cluster integrals and the mass action functions of helium atoms and ionic triple associates as well as for the equation of state (EoS).</description>

      <title>Excluded volume effect of surfactant ligands on the shape of nascent nanocrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the excluded volume of surfactant ligands on the shape of incipient quantum dots (QDs) to which they are attached. We consider a model in which ligands are represented by hard-sphere particles that are bound to the surface of a nanoparticle (NC) that is cast in the shape of a prism. It is found in Monte Carlo simulations that the ensemble of relevant NC conformations consists of a small number of specific states that take on the form of nanoplates and nanorods. The shape of these states can be well described by the derived theoretical models. At increasing ligand density, the free energy of different states is seen to be approximately the same, suggesting that excluded volume interactions among ligands acts to narrow down the conformational space accessible to an NC without creating a statistical preference for any particular configuration.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Networks Enable High Fidelity Shear Wave Viscoelastography across Multiple organs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tissue viscoelasticity has been recognized as a crucial biomechanical indicator for disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Conventional shear wave elastography techniques depend on dispersion analysis and face fundamental limitations in clinical scenarios. Particularly, limited wave propagation data with low signal-to-noise ratios, along with challenges in discriminating between dual dispersion sources stemming from viscoelasticity and finite tissue dimensions, pose great difficulties for extracting dispersion relation. In this study, we introduce SWVE-Net, a framework for shear wave viscoelasticity imaging based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN). SWVE-Net circumvents dispersion analysis by directly incorporating the viscoelasticity wave motion equation into the loss functions of the PINN. Finite element simulations reveal that SWVE-Net quantifies viscosity parameters within a wide range (0.15-1.5 Pa*s), even for samples just a few millimeters in size, where substantial wave reflections and dispersion occur. Ex vivo experiments demonstrate its applicability across various organs, including brain, liver, kidney, and spleen, each with distinct viscoelasticity. In in vivo human trials on breast and skeletal muscle tissues, SWVE-Net reliably assesses viscoelastic properties with standard deviation-to-mean ratios below 15%, highlighting robustness under real-world constraints. SWVE-Net overcomes the core limitations of conventional elastography and enables reliable viscoelastic characterization where traditional methods fall short. It holds promise for applications such as grading hepatic lipid accumulation, detecting myocardial infarction boundaries, and distinguishing malignant from benign tumors.</description>
