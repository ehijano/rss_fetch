      <title>Two and three-state quantum heat engines with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum heat engines have undergone extensive studies over the last two decades. Simultaneously, the studies of the applications of stochastic resetting in various fields are on the rise. We explore the effect of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level quantum heat engine. The extracted work is shown to increase with the resetting rate. However, the effective efficiency that includes the work expended in resetting is shown to exhibit a steady decay with the increase in resetting rate. The efficient power is observed to increase beyond that obtained in the absence of resetting, and is shown to be higher for a three-level engine.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics Framework to Address the Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the center of fluctuations, i.e., the nonequilibrium eigenphase, undergoes transformation, there emerge critical parameters that demonstrate insensitivity to fluctuation perturbations and even independence from the molecular physical properties of the system, while exhibiting pronounced efficacy in governing phase transition dynamics.In the context of polymer glass transitions, Flory's conjecture (or C1 in the WLF equation) represents such a longstanding yet unresolved critical parameter. To address this issue, we replace entropy variation with a sequence of microstates and provide an analytically tractable statistical description of non-ergodicity. Our theory rigorously demonstrates that reaching the critical parameter is a necessary condition for non-equilibrium transitions to occur. Due to correlations between the eigenphase's entropy and energy in non-equilibrium systems, any system with a given intrinsic structure inherently possesses a critical parameter that represents the limiting deviation from equilibrium at any temperature. Flory's conjecture exemplifies this, with our new theoretical critical void ratio at the glass transition boundary calculated to be 2.6%, which closely matches experimental observations of 2.5%-2.6% over the past 50 years.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy can make a moving active fluid membrane rough or crumpled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic theory of anisotropic and inversion-asymmetric moving active permeable fluid membranes. These are described by an anisotropic Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation. Depending upon the anisotropy parameters, the membrane can be large-scale anisotropic and logarithmically rough with translational quasi long range order and orientational long range order, together with the relaxational dynamics being logarithmically faster than ordinary diffusion. For other choices of the anisotropy parameters, the membrane is either effectively isotropic and algebraically rough with translational short, but orientational long range order, or crumpled.</description>

      <title>Loewner Evolution for Critical Invasion Percolation Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the Schramm--Loewner Evolution (SLE) to model branching structures while preserving conformal invariance and other stochastic properties remains a formidable research challenge. Unlike simple paths, branching structures, or trees, must be associated with discontinuous driving functions. Moreover, the driving function of a particular tree is not unique and depends on the order in which the branches are explored during the SLE process. This study investigates trees formed by nontrapping invasion percolation (NTIP) within the SLE framework. Three strategies for exploring a tree are employed: the invasion percolation process itself, Depth--First Search (DFS), and Breadth--First Search (BFS). We analyze the distributions of displacements of the Loewner driving functions and compute their spectral densities. Additionally, we investigate the inverse problem of deriving new traces from the driving functions, achieving a reasonably accurate reconstruction of the tree-like structures using the BFS and NTIP methods. Our results suggest the lack of conformal invariance in the exploration paths of the trees, as evidenced by the non-Brownian nature of the driving functions for the BFS and NTIP methods, and the inconsistency of the diffusion constants for the DFS method.</description>

      <title>Mixed-wet percolation on a dual square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a percolation model that is inspired by recent works on immiscible two-phase flow in a mixed-wet porous medium made of a mixture of grains with two different wettability properties. The percolation model is constructed on a dual lattice where the sites on the primal lattice represent the grains of the porous medium, and the bonds on the dual lattice represent the pores in between the grains. The bonds on the dual lattice are occupied based on the two adjacent sites on the primal lattice, which represent the pores where the capillary forces average to zero. The spanning cluster of the bonds, therefore, represents the flow network through which the two immiscible fluids can flow without facing any capillary barrier. It turns out to be a percolation transition of the perimeters of a site percolation problem. We study the geometrical properties at the criticality of the perimeter system numerically. A scaling theory is developed for these properties, and their scaling relations with the respective density parameters are studied. We also verified their finite-size scaling relations. Though the site clusters and their perimeters look very different compared to ordinary percolation, the singular behaviour of the associated geometrical properties remains unchanged. The critical exponents are found to be those of the ordinary percolation.</description>

      <title>Dynamical scaling study of three-dimensional XY spin glass toward the spin-chirality decoupling picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Thermodynamic Properties of Classical Oscillators Under Statistical and Superstatistical Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the thermodynamic properties of classical oscillators under different statistical distributions, focusing on the behavior of uniform distribution, two-level distribution, gamma distribution, log-normal distribution, and F-distribution as the nonequilibrium parameter q varies. By calculating Helmholtz free energy and entropy, we reveal the unique patterns and characteristics exhibited by each distribution during the process of moving away from equilibrium. The results show that uniform and two-level distributions exhibit consistent trends of decreasing free energy and increasing entropy under nonequilibrium statistics, reflecting an increase in system disorder. In contrast, the gamma, log-normal, and F-distributions display complex dual-equilibrium point phenomena, where the system can briefly return to equilibrium at specific q values. However, as q further increases, the system rapidly moves away from equilibrium, exhibiting pronounced nonequilibrium characteristics. These findings not only deepen our understanding of nonequilibrium statistical physics but also provide new theoretical perspectives and methods for studying the nonequilibrium behavior of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction-free ergodicity breaking in spherical model driven by temporally hyperuniform noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temporal hyperuniformity of driving forces in the spherical model. The spherical model with $p$-body random interactions is a prototypical model to investigate the ergodicity breaking of glass transitions, where the spin-spin interactions are key ingredients to cause the ergodicity breaking. However, for the model driven by temporally hyperuniform noise, the strong anticorrelation of the noise can solely cause an ergodicity breaking even without spin-spin interactions. Near the transition point, the static susceptibility and relaxation time show power-law divergence with a common critical exponent, which varies depending on the strength of hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections from the subleading magnetic scaling field for the Ising and Potts models in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In finite-size scaling analyses of critical phenomena, proper consideration of correction terms, which can come from different sources, plays an important role. For the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in two dimensions, although the subleading magnetic scaling field, with exactly known exponent, is theoretically expected to give rise in finite-size-scaling analyses, numerical observation remains elusive probably due to the mixing of various corrections. We simulate the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal lattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model but has suppressed corrections from other sources, and provides strong numerical evidence for the attribution of the subleading magnetic field in finite-size corrections. Interestingly, it is also observed that the corrections in small- and large-cluster-size regions have opposite magnitudes, and, for the special $n=2$ case, they compensate with each other in observables like the second moment of the cluster-size distribution. Our finding reveals that the effect of the subleading magnetic field should be taken into account in finite-size-scaling analyses, which was unfortunately ignored in many previous studies.</description>

      <title>Crack propagation by activated avalanches during creep and fatigue from elastic interface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of cracks combines materials science, fracture mechanics, and statistical physics. The importance of fluctuations in the crack velocity is fundamental since it signals that the crack overcomes local barriers such as tough spots by avalanches. In ductile materials the omnipresent plasticity close to the crack tip influences the growth by history effects, which we here study in polymethylmetacrylate by various fatigue and creep protocols. We show how the crack tip local history may be encompassed in a time- and protocol dependent lengthscale, that allows to apply a statistical fracture description to the time-dependent crack growth rate, resolving the well-known paradox why fatigue cracks grow faster if the stress during a cycle is let to relax more from the peak value. The results open up novel directions for understanding fracture by statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleation in the supercooled Yukawa system is relevant for addressing current challenges in understanding a range of crystallizing systems including white dwarf (WD) stars. We use both brute force and seeded molecular dynamics simulations to study homogeneous nucleation of crystals from supercooled Yukawa liquids. With our improved approach to seeded simulations, we obtain quantitative predictions of the crystal nucleation rate and cluster size distributions as a function of temperature and screening length. These quantitative results show trends towards fast nucleation with short-ranged potentials. They also indicate that for temperatures $T &gt; 0.9T_m$, where $T_m$ is the melt temperature, classical homogeneous nucleation is too slow to initiate crystallization but transient clusters of around 100 particles should be common. We apply these general results to a typical WD model and obtain a delay of approximately 0.6 Gyr in the onset of crystallization that may be observable.</description>

Abstract: We consider $L$-directional associative memories, composed of $L$ Hopfield networks, displaying imitative Hebbian intra-network interactions and anti-imitative Hebbian inter-network interactions, where couplings are built over a set of hidden binary patterns. We evaluate the model's performance in reconstructing the whole set of hidden binary patterns when provided with mixtures of noisy versions of these patterns. Our numerical results demonstrate the model's high effectiveness in the reconstruction task for structureless and structured datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known for some time that autocorrelations of words in human-written texts decay according to a power law. Recent works have also shown that the autocorrelations decay in texts generated by LLMs is qualitatively different from the literary texts. Solid state physics tie the autocorrelations decay laws to the states of matter. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, depending on the temperature parameter, LLMs can generate text that can be classified as solid, critical state or gas.</description>

      <title>Don't look back: Ordering and defect cloaking in non-reciprocal lattice XY models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analytical and numerical examination, on square and triangular lattices, of the non-reciprocal planar spin model introduced in Dadhichi et al., Phys. Rev. E 101, 052601 (2020). We show that in principle the effect of lattice anisotropy should persist at large scales, leading to a ''mass'' for the angle field of the spins, and behaviour not in the ''Malthusian Toner-Tu'' universality class. Numerically, however, we find power-law scaling of long-wavelength equal-time correlators in the polar-ordered phase of our lattice model. The mass, if present, is very small. Focussing on topological defects, we show numerically that defect interactions are highly anisotropic with respect to the mean ordering direction. In particular, the constituents of a $\pm 1$ pair are shielded from each other in a class of configurations, deferring their annihilation and allowing time for the nucleation of further defects. The result, we show numerically, is the destruction of the polarised phase via an aster apocalypse reminiscent of that found by Besse et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 268003 (2022), for the Malthusian Toner-Tu equation.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>

      <title>The Topology of Rayleigh-Levy Flights in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rayleigh-L\'evy flights are simplified cosmological tools which capture certain essential statistical properties of the cosmic density field, including hierarchical structures in higher-order correlations, making them a valuable reference for studying the highly non-linear regime of structure formation. Unlike standard Markovian processes, they exhibit long-range correlations at all orders. Following on recent work on one dimensional flights, this study explores the one-point statistics and Minkowski functionals (density PDF, perimeter, Euler characteristic) of Rayleigh-L\'evy flights in two dimensions. We derive the Euler characteristic in the mean field approximation and the density PDF and iso-field perimeter $W_{1}$ in beyond mean field calculations, and validate the results against simulations. The match is excellent throughout, even for fields with large variances, in particular when finite volume effects in the simulations are taken into account and when the calculation is extended beyond the mean field.</description>

      <title>Some Thermal Properties of Ideal Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the thermal properties of non-relativistic many-body systems at finite temperature and chemical potential. We compute the one-point function of various operators constructed out of the basic fields in ideal bosonic and fermionic many-body systems. The one-point function is non-zero only for operators with zero particle numbers. We investigate these operators in $\mathbb R^d$ and $\mathbb R^d_{+}$, i.e. a flat space with a planar boundary. Furthermore, we compute the Green's function and using the operator product expansion, we express it in terms of the thermal one-point function of the higher spin currents. On $\mathbb R^d_{+}$, the operator product expansion allows to express the bulk-bulk Green's function in terms of the thermal Green's function of the boundary operators.
  We also study the ideal system by placing it on curved spatial surfaces, specifically spherical surfaces. We compute the partition function and Green's function on spheres, squashed-sphere and hemispheres. Finally, we compute the large radius corrections to the partition function and Green's function by expanding in the large radius limit.</description>

      <title>Concentration via Metastable Mixing, with Applications to the Supercritical Exponential Random Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a folklore belief that metastable wells in low-temperature statistical mechanics models exhibit high-temperature behavior. We prove a rigorous version of this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM) through the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a new general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well from the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary distribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more traditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the supercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit metastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel concentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM conditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24]. This extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical (high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and we are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality to these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the count of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges. Finally, to supplement the mathematical content of the article, we also discuss the results of what appears to be the first simulation study of a metastable well in the supercritical ERGM.</description>

      <title>Slow-fast systems with stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the effects of instantaneous stochastic resetting on a planar slow-fast dynamical system of the form $\dot{x}=f(x)-y$ and $\dot{y}=\epsilon (x-y)$ with $0&lt;\epsilon \ll 1$. We assume that only the fast variable $x(t)$ resets to its initial state $x_0$ at a random sequence of times generated from a Poisson process of rate $r$. Fixing the slow variable, we determine the parameterized probability density $p(x,t|y)$, which is the solution to a modified Liouville equation. We then show how for $r\gg \epsilon$ the slow dynamics can be approximated by the averaged equation $dy/d\tau=\E[x|y]-y$ where $\tau=\epsilon t$, $\E[x|y]=\int x p^*(x|y)dx$ and $p^*(x|y)=\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}p(x,t|y)$. We illustrate the theory for $f(x)$ given by the cubic function of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We find that the slow variable typically converges to an $r$-dependent fixed point $y^*$ that is a solution of the equation $y^*=\E[x|y^*]$. Finally, we numerically explore deviations from averaging theory when $r=O(\epsilon)$.</description>

      <title>Propelling Ferrimagnetic Domain Walls by Dynamical Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-particle systems driven out of thermal equilibrium can show properties qualitatively different from any thermal state. Here, we study a ferrimagnet in a weak oscillating magnetic field. In this model, domain walls are not static, but are shown to move actively in a direction chosen by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Thus they act like self-propelling units. Their collective behaviour is reminiscent of other systems with actively moving units studied in the field of 'active matter', where, e.g., flocks of birds are investigated. The active motion of the domain walls emerges from 'dynamical frustration'. The antiferromagnetic xy-order rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, determined by the sign of the ferromagnetic component. This necessarily leads to frustration at a domain wall, which gets resolved by propelling the domain wall with a velocity proportional to the square root of the driving power across large parameter regimes. This motion and strong hydrodynamic interactions lead to a linear growth of the magnetic correlation length over time, much faster than in equilibrium. The dynamical frustration furthermore makes the system highly resilient to noise. The correlation length of the weakly driven one-dimensional system can be orders of magnitude larger than in the corresponding equilibrium system with the same noise level.</description>

      <title>Gyromorphs: a new class of functional disordered materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of functional correlated disordered materials, termed Gyromorphs, which uniquely combine liquid-like translational disorder with quasi-long-range rotational order, induced by a ring of $G$ delta peaks in their structure factor. We generate gyromorphs in $2d$ and $3d$ by spectral optimization methods, verifying that they display strong discrete rotational order but no long-range translational order, while maintaining rotational isotropy at short range for sufficiently large $G$. We show that they are distinct from quasicrystals, which we argue are akin to Fourier ''duals'' of gyromorphs. Using a coupled dipoles approximation, we show that these structures outperform quasicrystals, stealthy hyperuniformity, and Vogel spirals in the formation of low-index-contrast isotropic bandgaps in $2d$, for both scalar and vector waves, and open complete isotropic bandgaps in $3d$. Finally, we introduce ''polygyromorphs'' with several rotational symmetries at different length scales (i.e., multiple rings of delta peaks), enabling the formation of multiple bandgaps in a single structure, thereby paving the way for fine control over optical properties.</description>

Abstract: An infinite number of solvable Hamiltonians, including the transverse Ising chain, the XY chain with an external field, the cluster model with next-nearest-neighbor x-x interactions, or with next-nearest-neighbor z-z interactions, and other solvable models that can be mapped to the free fermion system are considered. All the conserved charges of these models written by the string-type products of the interactions are obtained. In the case of the transverse Ising chain, all the known charges are rederived, and in the case of the other models, new conserved charges are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic force and irreversible current are the foundational concepts of classical nonequilibrium thermodynamics. Entropy production rate is provided by their product in classical systems, ranging from mesoscopic to macroscopic systems. However, there is no complete quantum extension of such a structure that respects quantum mechanics. In this paper, we propose anti-Hermitian operators that represent currents and forces accompanied by a gradient structure in open quantum systems described by the quantum master equation. We prove that the entropy production rate is given by the product of the force and current operators, which extends the canonical expression of the entropy production rate in the classical systems. The framework constitutes a comprehensive analogy with the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of discrete classical systems. We also show that the structure leads to the extensions of some results in stochastic thermodynamics: the geometric housekeeping-excess decomposition of entropy production and thermodynamic trade-off relations such as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and the dissipation-time uncertainty relation. In discussing the trade-off relations, we will introduce a measure of fluctuation, which we term the quantum diffusivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tsallis entropy, which possesses non-extensive property, is derived from the first principle employing the non-extensive Hamiltonian or the $q$-deformed Hamiltonian with the canonical ensemble assumption in statistical mechanics. Here, the $q$-algebra and properties of $q$-deformed functions are extensively used throughout the derivation. Consequently, the thermodynamic quantities, e.g. internal energy and Helmholtz free energy, are derived and they inheritly exhibit the non-extensiveness. From this intriguing connection between Tasllis entropy and the $q$-deformed Hamiltonian, the parameter $q$ encapsulates the intrinsic degree of non-extensivity for the thermodynamic systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum spin system on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ with uniform nearest-neighbor interaction of the XY or XYZ type and arbitrary uniform magnetic field. By extending the method recently developed for quantum spin chains, we prove that the model possesses no local conserved quantities except for the trivial ones, such as the Hamiltonian. This result strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. We note that our result applies to the XX model without a magnetic field, which is one of the easiest solvable models in one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical study to determine nucleation rates for magnetisation reversal within the Ising model (lattice gas model) in the low-temperature regime, a domain less explored in previous research. To achieve this, we implemented the N-Fold way algorithm, a well-established method for low-temperature simulations, alongside a novel, highly efficient cluster identification algorithm. Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighbouring spins (spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique seems ineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights into nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and experimental understanding.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Gaussianity of heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous diffusion processes are prevalent in various fields, including the motion of proteins in living cells, the migratory movement of birds and mammals, and finance. These processes are often characterized by time-varying dynamics, where interactions with the environment evolve, and the system undergoes fluctuations in diffusivity. Moreover, in many complex systems anomalous diffusion is observed, where the mean square displacement (MSD) exhibits non-linear scaling with time. Among the models used to describe this phenomenon, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) is a widely applied stochastic process, particularly for systems exhibiting long-range temporal correlations. Although FBM is characterized by Gaussian increments, heterogeneous processes with FBM-like characteristics may deviate from Gaussianity. In this article, we study the non-Gaussian behavior of switching fractional Brownian motion (SFBM), a model in which the diffusivity of the FBM process varies while temporal correlations are maintained. To characterize non-Gaussianity, we evaluate the kurtosis, a common tool used to quantify deviations from the normal distribution. We derive exact expressions for the kurtosis of the considered heterogeneous anomalous diffusion process and investigate how it can identify non-Gaussian behavior. We also compare the kurtosis results with those obtained using the Hellinger distance, a classical measure of divergence between probability density functions. Through both analytical and numerical methods, we demonstrate the potential of kurtosis as a metric for detecting non-Gaussianity in heterogeneous anomalous diffusion processes.</description>

      <title>One-body dynamical correlation function of Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00282v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical correlated properties of one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases provide profound understanding of novel physics emergent from collective excitations, for instance, the breakdown of off-diagonal long-range order, and the establishment of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. However, due to the nonperturbative nature of 1D many-body systems, the exact evaluation of correlation functions is notoriously difficult. Here, by means of a form factor approach based on an algebraic Bethe ansatz and numerics, we present a thorough study on the one-body dynamical correlation function (1BDCF) of the Lieb-Liniger model at finite temperature. The influence of thermal fluctuation and interaction on the behavior of 1BDCF has been demonstrated and analyzed from various perspectives, including the spectral distribution, the line shape at fixed momentum, and the corresponding static correlations.</description>

      <title>Vulnerability of fault-tolerant topological quantum error correction to quantum deviations in code space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers face significant challenges from quantum deviations or coherent noise, particularly during gate operations, which pose a complex threat to the efficacy of quantum error correction (QEC) protocols. In this study, we scrutinize the performance of the topological toric code in 2 dimension (2D) under the dual influence of stochastic noise and quantum deviations, especially during the critical phases of initial state preparation and error detection facilitated by multi-qubit entanglement gates. By mapping the protocol for multi-round error detection--from the inception of an imperfectly prepared code state via imperfect stabilizer measurements--to a statistical mechanical model characterized by a 3-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory coupled with a 2-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, we establish a novel link between the error threshold and the model's phase transition point. We find two distinct error thresholds that demarcate varying efficacies in error correction. The empirical threshold that signifies the operational success of QEC aligns with the theoretical ideal of flawless state preparation operations. Contrarily, below another finite theoretical threshold, a phenomenon absent in purely stochastic error models emerges: unidentifiable measurement errors precipitate QEC failure in scenarios with large code distances. For codes of finite or modest distance $d$, it is revealed that maintaining the preparation error rate beneath a crossover scale, proportional to $1/\log d$, allows for the suppression of logical errors. Considering that fault-tolerant quantum computation is valuable only in systems with large scale and exceptionally low logical error rates, this investigation explicitly demonstrates the vulnerability of 2D toric codes to quantum deviations in code space.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity for non-local spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11677v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon recent research in spin systems with non-local interactions, this study investigates operator growth using the Krylov complexity in different non-local versions of the Ising model. We find that the non-locality results in a faster scrambling of the operator to all sites. While the saturation value of Krylov complexity of local integrable and local chaotic theories differ by a significant margin, this difference is much suppressed when non-local terms are introduced in both regimes. This results from the faster scrambling of information in the presence of non-locality. In addition, we investigate the behavior of level statistics and spectral form factor as probes of quantum chaos to study the integrability breaking due to non-local interactions. Our numerics indicate that in the non-local case, late time saturation of Krylov complexity distinguishes between different underlying theories, while the early time complexity growth distinguishes different degrees of non-locality.</description>

      <title>Multistep reversible excitation transfer in a multicomponent rigid solution: II. Modeling the dynamics of radiationless transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To determine the effect of nonradiative excitation energy transfer on the fluorescence of a rigid multicomponent solution, a new analytical method was developed by treating this transfer as a time-resolved Markov chain (TRMC). In the TRMC approach, we assume that the Markov chain under consideration is governed by bivariate joint probability mass-density functions. One of the random variables is discrete and represents the state number to which the process passes at a given step, while the other random variable is continuous and determines the moment in time at which this transition occurs. In general, the time distributions of this second variable can be arbitrary, continuous or discrete, and not just exponential, as required by the method known as continuous time Markov chains (CTMC). The correctness of the TRMC method is confirmed by the fact that the time courses of fluorescence intensities calculated by this method agree with those calculated using ordinary analytical methods. In the section on calculating the quantum yields of individual components, the suitability of a method known as discrete time Markov chains (DTMC) was found. However, we argue that the DTMC method does not refer to time and propose to rename it as time-unspecified Markov chain (TUMC). The results generated by TRMC, when integrated over time, become equivalent to those generated by TUMC. The fluorescence cases of binary and ternary solutions are discussed in detail</description>

      <title>Computable entanglement cost under positive partial transpose operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularisations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). By means of an analytical example, a previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. Building on a previous characterisation of the PPT entanglement cost in terms of a regularised formula, we construct instead a hierarchy of semi-definite programs that bypasses the issue of regularisation altogether, and converges to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}(D,\,\log(1/\varepsilon))$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of thermal active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter concerns many-body systems comprised of living or self-driven agents that collectively exhibit macroscopic phenomena distinct from conventional passive matter. Using Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory, we develop a novel hydrodynamic framework for thermal active matter that accounts for energy balance, local temperature variations, and the ensuing stochastic effects. By modelling active matter as a driven open system, we show that the source of active contributions to hydrodynamics, violations of fluctuation-dissipation theorems, and detailed balance is rooted in the breaking of time-translation symmetry due to the presence of fuel consumption and an external environmental bath. In addition, our framework allows for non-equilibrium steady states that produce entropy, with a well-defined notion of steady-state temperature. We use our framework of active hydrodynamics to develop effective field theory actions for active superfluids and active nematics that offer a first-principle derivation of various active transport coefficients and feature activity-induced phase transitions. We also show how to incorporate temperature, energy and noise in fluctuating hydrodynamics for active matter. Our work suggests a broader perspective on active matter that can leave an imprint across scales.</description>

      <title>Defects induce phase transition from dynamic to static rippling in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials display nanoscale dynamic ripples that significantly impact their properties. Defects within the crystal lattice are the elementary building blocks to tailor the material's morphology. While some studies have explored the link between defective structures and rippling dynamics in 2D materials, a comprehensive understanding of this relationship has yet to be achieved. Here, we address this using machine learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we find that above a critical concentration of defects, free-standing graphene sheets undergo a dynamic transition from freely propagating to static ripples. Our computational approach captures the dynamics with atomic resolution, and reveals that the transition is driven by elastic interactions between defects. The strength of these interactions is found to vary across defect types and we identify a unifying set of principles driving the dynamic-to-static transition in 2D materials. Our work not only rationalises puzzling experimental results for defective 2D materials, but also paves the way to design two-dimensional devices with tailored rippling dynamics. These insights could lay the foundations for a new class of disorder-based catalytic and interfacial materials.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Correlations in Dual-Unitary Quantum Circuits: Partial Spectral Form Factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the notion of quantum chaos is tied to random matrix spectral correlations, also eigenstate properties in chaotic systems are often assumed to be described by random matrix theory. Analytic insights into eigenstate correlations can be obtained by the recently introduced partial spectral form factor. Here, we study the partial spectral form factor in chaotic dual-unitary quantum circuits in the thermodynamic limit. We compute the latter for a finite subsystem in a brickwork circuit coupled to an infinite complement. For initial times, shorter than the subsystem's size, spatial locality and (dual) unitarity implies a constant partial spectral form factor, clearly deviating from the linear ramp of the random matrix prediction. In contrast, for larger times we prove, that the partial spectral form factor follows the random matrix result up to exponentially suppressed corrections. We supplement our exact analytical results by semi-analytic computations performed in the thermodynamic limit as well as with numerics for finite-size systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that for any $d$, any state for $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces that each form an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, with rare "inverse quantum many-body scar" eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterizing the transition, and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of certain special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Quantum Many-body Scars with Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are rare eigenstates hidden within the chaotic spectra of many-body systems, representing a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Identifying these scars, as well as other non-thermal states in complex quantum systems, remains a significant challenge. Besides exact scar states, the nature of other non-thermal states lacking simple analytical characterization remains an open question. In this study, we employ tools from quantum machine learning -- specifically, (enhanced) quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), to explore hidden non-thermal states in chaotic many-body systems. Our simulations demonstrate that QCNNs achieve over 99% single-shot measurement accuracy in identifying all known scars. Furthermore, we successfully identify new non-thermal states in models such as the xorX model, the PXP model, and the far-coupling Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. In the xorX model, some of these non-thermal states can be approximately described as spin-wave modes of specific quasiparticles. We further develop effective tight-binding Hamiltonians within the quasiparticle subspace to capture key features of these many-body eigenstates. Finally, we validate the performance of QCNNs on IBM quantum devices, achieving single-shot measurement accuracy exceeding 63% under real-world noise and errors, with the aid of error mitigation techniques. Our results underscore the potential of QCNNs to uncover hidden non-thermal states in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Tracking the variation of entanglement R\'enyi negativity: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (microagents), which self-propel through a rotating potential barrier in a static, viscous, fluid background. The microagent's motion begins at a specified origin and terminates at a designated destination. The potential barrier is modeled as a localized, repulsive Gaussian potential with finite support, whose peak location rotates at a given angular velocity about a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use the Advantage Actor-Critic approach to train microagents for their origin-to-destination navigation through the barrier. By employing this approach, we demonstrate that the rotating potential (as opposed to a static one) enables size-based sorting and separation of the microagents. In other words, microagents of different radii arrive at the destination at sufficiently well-separated average times, facilitating their sorting. The efficiency of particle sorting is quantified by introducing specific separation measures. We also demonstrate how training the microagents in a noisy background, as opposed to a noise-free one, can improve the precision of their size-based sorting. Our findings suggest promising avenues for future research on smart active particles equipped with deep reinforcement learning to navigate complex environments, particularly in microscale applications.</description>

Abstract: We compute observables of the critical 3d Ising model to high precision by applying the numerical conformal bootstrap to mixed correlators of the leading scalar operators $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$, and the stress tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$. We obtain new precise determinations of scaling dimensions $(\Delta_\sigma, \Delta_\epsilon) = (0.518148806(24), 1.41262528(29))$ as well as OPE coefficients involving $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $T_{\mu\nu}$. We also describe several improvements made along the way to algorithms and software tools for the numerical bootstrap.</description>

Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the motility behaviour of microorganisms, we introduce a highly tunable, robotic system self-actuating into the run-and-tumble (RT)-like motion. It comprises two disk-shaped, centimeter-scale programmable robots individually programmed to perform overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion and connected by a rigid rod. The rod is attached to pivot points located on off-centered, mirror-symmetric points on each robot, allowing for its free rotation at both ends. We show that the collective dynamics of this system execute RT-like motion with characteristic sharp tumble events and exponentially distributed run times, similar to those observed in microorganisms. We further quantify emerging dynamics in terms of tumbling frequency and tune it over a wide range of experimental parameters. We also develop a theoretical model that reproduces our experimental results and elucidates the underlying physical mechanisms governing the rich phase behavior of RT motion. Together, these results highlight the importance of our robotic platform in offering valuable insights into the mechanism of motility characteristics in microorganisms.</description>

      <title>Local Quenches from a Krylov Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate local quench dynamics in two-dimensional conformal field theories using Krylov space methods. We derive Lanczos coefficients, spread complexity, and Krylov entropies for local joining and splitting quenches in theories on an infinite line, a circle, a finite interval, and at finite temperature. We examine how these quantities depend on the central charge of the underlying conformal field theory and find that both spread complexity and Krylov entropy are proportional to it. Interestingly, Krylov entropies evolve logarithmically with time, mirroring standard entanglement entropies, making them useful for extracting the central charge. In the large central charge limit, using holography, we establish a connection between the rate of spread complexity and the proper momentum of the tip of the end-of-the world brane, which probes the bulk analogously to a point particle. Our results further demonstrate that spread complexity and Krylov entropies are powerful tools for probing non-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems.</description>
