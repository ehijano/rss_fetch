      <title>Critical Transit Infrastructure in Smart Cities and Urban Air Quality: A Multi-City Seasonal Comparison of Ridership and PM2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public transit is a critical component of urban mobility and equity, yet mobility and air-quality linkages are rarely operationalized in reproducible smart-city analytics workflows. This study develops a transparent, multi-source monitoring dataset that integrates agency-reported transit ridership with ambient fine particulate matter PM2.5 from the U.S. EPA Air Quality System (AQS) for four U.S. metropolitan areas - New York City, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, using two seasonal snapshots (March and October 2024). We harmonize heterogeneous ridership feeds (daily and stop-level) to monthly system totals and pair them with monthly mean PM2.5 , reporting both absolute and per-capita metrics to enable cross-city comparability. Results show pronounced structural differences in transit scale and intensity, with consistent seasonal shifts in both ridership and PM2.5 that vary by urban context. A set of lightweight regression specifications is used as a descriptive sensitivity analysis, indicating that apparent mobility-PM2.5 relationships are not uniform across cities or seasons and are strongly shaped by baseline city effects. Overall, the paper positions integrated mobility and environment monitoring as a practical smart-city capability, offering a scalable framework for tracking infrastructure utilization alongside exposure-relevant air-quality indicators to support sustainable communities and public-health-aware urban resilience.</description>

      <title>Resilient-to-Fragile Transition and Excess Volatility in Supply Chain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the disequilibrium dynamics of a stylised model of production networks in which firms use perishable and non-substitutable intermediate inputs, so that adverse idiosyncratic productivity shocks can trigger downstream shortages and output losses. To protect against such disruptions, firms hold precautionary inventories that act as buffer stocks. We show that, for a given dispersion of firm-level productivity shocks, there exists a critical level of inventories above which the economy remains in a stable stochastic steady state. Below this critical level, the system becomes fragile, i.e., it becomes prone to system-wide crises. As this resilience-fragility boundary is approached from above, aggregate output volatility rises sharply and diverges, even though shocks are purely idiosyncratic. Because inventories are costly, competitive pressures induce firms to economize on buffers. Although we do not explicitly model such costs, we argue that the resulting behaviour of individual firms drives the system close to criticality, generating persistent excess macroeconomic volatility -- in other words, ``small shocks, large cycles'' -- in line with other settings where efficiency and resilience are in tension with each other. In the language of phase transitions, the resilient-to-fragile transition is continuous (supercritical): the economy exhibits a well-defined stochastic equilibrium with finite volatility on one side of the boundary, while beyond it the probability of a collapse in finite time tends to one. We characterize this transition primarily through numerical simulations and derive an analytical description in a high-perishability, high-connectivity limit.</description>

      <title>Manipulation in Prediction Markets: An Agent-based Modeling Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction markets mobilize financial incentives to forecast binary event outcomes through the aggregation of dispersed beliefs and heterogeneous information. Their growing popularity and demonstrated predictive accuracy in political elections have raised speculation and concern regarding their susceptibility to manipulation and the potential consequences for democratic processes. Using agent-based simulations combined with an analytic characterization of price dynamics, we study how high-budget agents can introduce price distortions in prediction markets. We explore the persistence and stability of these distortions in the presence of herding or stubborn agents, and analyze how agent expertise affects market-price variance. Firstly we propose an agent-based model of a prediction market in which bettors with heterogeneous expertise, noisy private information, variable learning rates and budgets observe the evolution of public opinion on a binary election outcome to inform their betting strategies in the market. The model exhibits stability across a broad parameter space, with complex agent behaviors and price interactions producing self-regulatory price discovery. Second, using this simulation framework, we investigate the conditions under which a highly resourced minority, or ''whale'' agent, with a biased valuation can distort the market price, and for how long. We find that biased whales can temporarily shift prices, with the magnitude and duration of distortion increasing when non-whale bettors exhibit herding behavior and slow learning. Our theoretical analysis corroborates these results, showing that whales can shift prices proportionally to their share of market capital, with distortion duration depending on non-whale learning rates and herding intensity.</description>

      <title>Directionality and node heterogeneity reshape criticality in hypergraph percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed and heterogeneous hypergraphs capture directional higher-order interactions with intrinsically asymmetric functional dependencies among nodes. As a result, damage to certain nodes can suppress entire hyperedges, whereas failure of others only weakens interactions. Metabolic reaction networks offer an intuitive example of such asymmetric dependencies. Here we develop a message-passing and statistical mechanics framework for percolation in directed hypergraphs that explicitly incorporates directionality and node heterogeneity. Remarkably, we show that these hypergraph features have a fundamental effect on the critical properties of hypergraph percolation, reshaping criticality in a way that depends on network structure. Specifically, we derive anomalous critical exponents that depend on whether node or hyperedge percolation is considered in maximally correlated, heavy-tailed regimes. These theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic hypergraph models and on a real directed metabolic network, opening new perspectives for the characterization of the robustness and resilience of real-world directed, heterogeneous higher-order networks.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic match classification model for sports tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing match classification models in the tournament design literature have two major limitations: a contestant is considered indifferent only if uncertain future results do never affect its prize, and competitive matches are not distinguished with respect to the incentives of the contestants. We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities under the three main outcomes (win, draw, loss), which allows the classification of each match into six different categories. The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively. However, the robustly higher proportion of potentially collusive matches can threaten with serious scandals.</description>

      <title>Meeting the Needs of the Global Quantum Science Community: A Call to Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2025 marks one hundred years since the discovery of quantum mechanics. In the century since then, quantum science has blossomed into a global community composed of academics, engineers, developers, and entrepreneurs. The world is currently in the middle of the so-called second quantum revolution, with increased public awareness of quantum science and technology, and growing investment in both quantum hardware and software applications. However, representation remains low among historically marginalized groups: women, LGBTQ+, BIPOC, and people from the global south make up disproportionately few physicists. There are numerous efforts to improve diversity within quantum science, including through workforce development. But many of the changes enacted at the highest levels have failed to result in real change, as highlighted and discussed in the recent Women For Quantum Manifesto of Values. Here, we seek to echo and amplify the need for real change in the quantum ecosystem, emphasizing intersectionality and a feminist approach that centers the most vulnerable members of the quantum community: young students and researchers, especially those communities historically marginalized from quantum science.
  This report is our attempt to help quantum communities meet this need; we have conducted a survey of quantum scientists all over the world, and here we include both a preliminary report of our findings and policy suggestions we have built to address them. The primary results of our survey are that, 1) marginalized quantum scientists are experiencing hardships and challenges more than their more privileged peers across all metrics, 2) that this fact is hurting retention of diverse, talented quantum scientists in our field, and 3) quantum EDI is an investment in talent retention and resilience building, which are essential for a thriving, globally competitive quantum ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Empirical Growing Networks vs Minimal Models: Evidence and Challenges from Software Heritage and APS Citation Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale growing network linking software source-code versions from open-source communities. The network spans more than 40 years and includes about 6 billion nodes and edges. Our analysis relies on deterministic temporal and topological partitions of nodes and edges, which account for the multilayer and partially timestamped structure of the main graph. We derive a temporal graph that reveals a mesoscale structure and enables the study of edge dynamics--creation, inheritance, and aging--together with comparisons to minimal models using degree distributions and histograms of edge timestamp differences. The temporal graph also exposes regime shifts that correlate with changes in developer practices, as reflected in the average number of edges per new node. We estimate scaling exponents under the scale-free hypothesis and highlight the sensitivity of the estimation method used to both regime shifts and outliers, while showing that partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects. We extend the analysis to the APS citation network, which also exhibits a major regime shift, with an accelerated growth regime becoming dominant after 1985. Although both datasets are a priori good candidates for advanced quantitative analysis, our results illustrate how structural and dynamical transitions hamper our ability to draw firm conclusions about the existence and observability of a scale-free regime in these empirical networks. These findings underscore the need for refined tools and models to study transient growth regimes, to extend current frameworks toward minimal causal growth models, and to enable robust comparisons between empirical growing networks and minimal models.</description>

      <title>Active-Absorbing Phase Transitions in the Parallel Minority Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Parallel Minority Game (PMG) is a synchronous adaptive multi-agent model that exhibits active-absorbing transitions characteristic of non-equilibrium statistical systems. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of the PMG under two families of microscopic decision rules: (i) agents update their choices based on instantaneous population in their alternative choices, and (ii) threshold-based activation that activates agents movement only after overcrowding density crossing a threshold. We measure time-dependent and steady state limits of activity $A(t)$, overcrowding fraction $F(t)$ as functions of the control parameter $g=N/D$, where $N$ is the number of agents and $D$ is the total number of sites. Instantaneous rules display mean-field directed-percolation (MF-DP) scaling with $\beta\approx1.00$, $\delta\approx0.5$, and $\nu_{\parallel}\approx2.0$. Threshold rules, however, produce a distinct non-mean-field universality class with $\beta\approx0.75$ and a systematic failure of dynamical scaling. We show that thresholding acts as a relevant perturbation to the critical behavior of the model. The results highlight how minimal cognitive features at the agent level fundamentally alter large-scale critical behavior in socio-economic and active systems.</description>
