      <title>Computational modeling of the physical features that influence breast cancer invasion into adipose tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer invasion into adipose tissue strongly influences disease progression and metastasis. The degree of cancer cell invasion into adipose tissue depends on numerous biochemical and physical properties of cancer cells, adipocytes, and other key components of adipose tissue. We model breast cancer invasion into adipose tissue as a physical process by carrying out simulations of active, cohesive spherical particles (cancer cells) invading into confluent packings of deformable polyhedra (adipocytes). We quantify the degree of invasion by calculating the interfacial area $A_t$ between cancer cells and adipocytes. We determine the long-time value of $A_t$ versus the activity and strength of the cohesion between cancer cells, as well as mechanical properties of the adipocytes and extracellular matrix (ECM) in which the adipocytes are embedded. We show that the degree of invasion collapses onto a master curve by plotting it versus a dimensionless energy scale $E_c$, which grows linearly with mean-square fluctuations and persistence time of the cancer cell velocities, is inversely proportional to the pressure of the system, and has an offset that increases with the cancer cell cohesive energy. The condition, $E_c \gg 1$, indicates that cancer cells will invade the adipose tissue, whereas for $E_c \ll 1$, the cancer cells and adipocytes remain demixed. We also show that constraints on adipocyte positions by the ECM decrease $A_t$ relative to that obtained for unconstrained adipocytes. Finally, spatial heterogeneity in structural and mechanical properties of the adipocytes in the presence of ECM impedes invasion relative to adipose tissue with uniform properties.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Path integrals, Particular Kinds, and Strange Things": from Consciousness to Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path integral formulation introduced in [arXiv:2210.12761] "Path integrals, particular kinds, and strange things" by Friston and colleagues in 2023, offers an innovative lens for examining complex systems, particularly through its nuanced typology of particles. This comprehensive commentary focuses on strange particles, a distinct category whose concealed active states provide an intriguing model for understanding phenomena like consciousness and resilience. A key contribution of the formulation is its ability to express system dynamics in terms of densities over paths or trajectories, thereby circumventing the need for assumptions about stationary states. This is especially advantageous for analyzing non-stationary systems. The formulation introduces a nuanced typology of particles :active, inert, dissipative, conservative, ordinary, and strange. Each with unique properties that offer valuable insights into resilience, or specifically the notion of timescales and possibility for inner screens.</description>

      <title>Abiogenesis: a possible quantum interpretation of the telepoietic conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the research on the origin of life, topics that can be considered reasonably shared by the generality of researchers are initially identified. It is then shown that the application of these principles to the results obtained with the IdLE-IdLA mathematical model for the simulation of aggregative processes, leads to the conclusion that the primordial formation of self-replicating structures is difficult to reconcile with deterministic aggregative dynamics in the classical sense. Regardless of the extent to which the process itself is governed by chance or by aggregative codes written in the laws of chemistry, no conventional causality is likely. The model itself suggests only one possible way out, consistent with thermodynamics: the existence of information sets rushing into the system in a different way from the perceived time stream. The possibilities offered by quantum mechanics and its most recent interpretations are consequently investigated to try to interpret, at the level of particle physics, the suggestion of IdLE-IdLA model. The attempt leads to a mutual accreditation of macroscopic telepoiesis and a kind of quantum retrocausality. The result is a vision of the natural world in which the coexistence of causal and retrocausal dynamics is presented as a possible interpretative key of the whole complex of vital manifestations.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the efficiency of principal signal transmission modes in proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On the microscopic level, biological signal transmission relies on coordinated structural changes in allosteric proteins that involve sensor and effector modules. The timescales and microscopic details of signal transmission in proteins are often unclear, despite a plethora of structural information on signaling proteins. Based on linear-response theory, we develop a theoretical framework to define frequency-dependent force and displacement transmit functions through proteins and, more generally, viscoelastic media. Transmit functions quantify the fraction of a local time-dependent perturbation at one site, be it a deformation, a force, or a combination thereof, that survives at a second site. They are defined in terms of equilibrium fluctuations from simulations or experimental observations. We apply the framework to our all-atom molecular dynamics simulation data of a parallel, homodimeric coiled-coil (CC) motif that connects sensor and effector modules of a blue-light-regulated histidine kinase from bacterial signaling systems extensively studied in experiments. Our analysis reveals that signal transmission through the CC is possible via shift, splay, and twist deformation modes. Based on the results of mutation experiments, we infer that the most relevant mode for the biological function of the histidine kinase protein is the splay deformation.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics driven by surface curvature</title>

Abstract: Patterns on curved surfaces are ubiquitous, yet the influence of surface geometry on pattern dynamics remains elusive. We recently reported a new mechanism of pattern propagation in which a static pattern on a flat plane becomes a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. Here, we address whether surface curvature can drive more complex pattern dynamics beyond propagation. By employing a combination of weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, we show that oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics can emerge by controlling the surface shapes. These findings highlight a new role of surface topography in pattern formation and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of Turing pattern dynamics on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern dynamics on curved surfaces are ubiquitous. Although the effect of surface topography on pattern dynamics has gained much interest, there is a limited understanding of the roles of surface geometry and topology in pattern dynamics. Recently, we reported that a static pattern on a flat plane can become a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. By examining reaction-diffusion equations on axisymmetric surfaces, certain conditions for the onset of pattern propagation were determined. However, this analysis was limited by the assumption that the pattern propagates at a constant speed. Here, we investigate the pattern propagation driven by surface curvature using weakly nonlinear analysis, which enables a more comprehensive approach to the aforementioned problem. The analysis reveals consistent conditions of the pattern propagation similar to our previous results, and further predicts that rich dynamics other than pattern propagation, such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, can arise depending on the surface geometry. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between surfaces and pattern dynamics and a basis for controlling pattern dynamics on surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Salient Limitations of `On the Salient Limitations of the Methods of Assembly Theory and their Classification of Molecular Biosignatures'</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembly Theory (AT) is a theory that explains how to determine if a complex object is the product of evolution. Here we explain why attempts to compare AT to compression algorithms, ref 1, does not help identify if the object is the product of selection or not. Specifically, we show why aims to perform benchmark comparisons of different compression schemes to compare the performance of Molecular Assembly Indices against standard compression schemes in determining living vs. non-living samples fails to classify the data correctly. In their approach, Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, compress data from Marshall et al.2 describing the experimental basis for assembly theory and evaluate the difference in the resulting distributions of data. After several computational experiments Uthamacumaran et al., ref 1, conclude that other compression techniques obtain better results in the problem of detecting life and non-life that of assembly pathways. Here we explain why the approach presented by Uthamacumaran et al.1 appears to be lacking, and why it is not to reproduce their analysis with the information given.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Repulsion Between Chromosomes in Mammalian Oocyte Spindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During eukaryotic cell division, a microtubule-based structure called the spindle exerts forces on chromosomes, thereby organizing and segregating them Extensive work demonstrates that the forces acting parallel to the spindle axis, including those responsible for separating sister chromatids, are generated by microtubule polymerization and depolymerization, and molecular-motors. In contrast, little is known about the forces acting perpendicular to the spindle axis, which determine the configuration of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, and thus impact nuclear localization and rates of segregation errors. Here, we use quantitative live-cell microscopy to show that metaphase chromosomes are spatially anti-correlated in mouse oocyte spindles, indicating the existence of hitherto unknown long-range forces acting perpendicular to the spindle axis. We explain this observation by first demonstrating that the spindle's microtubule network behaves as a nematic liquid crystal, and then arguing that deformation of the nematic field around embedded chromosomes causes long-range repulsion between them. Our work highlights the surprising relevance of materials physics in understanding the structure, dynamics, and mechanics of cellular structures, and presents a novel and potentially generic mode of chromosome organization in large spindles.</description>

      <title>Modeling collective behaviors from optic flow and retinal cues</title>

Abstract: Animal collective behavior is often modeled with self-propelled particles, assuming each individual has ``omniscient'' knowledge of its neighbors. Yet, neighbors may be hidden from view and we do not know the effect of this information loss. To address this question, we propose a visual model of collective behavior where each particle moves according to bio-plausible visual cues, in particular the optic flow. This visual model successfully reproduces three classical collective behaviors: swarming, schooling, and milling. This model offers a potential solution for controlling artificial swarms visually.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for learning through structural plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of research indicates that structural plasticity mechanisms are crucial for learning and memory consolidation. Starting from a simple phenomenological model, we exploit a mean-field approach to develop a theoretical framework of learning through this kind of plasticity, capable of taking into account several features of the connectivity and pattern of activity of biological neural networks, including probability distributions of neuron firing rates, selectivity of the responses of single neurons to multiple stimuli, probabilistic connection rules and noisy stimuli. More importantly, it describes the effects of stabilization, pruning and reorganization of synaptic connections. This framework is used to compute the values of some relevant quantities used to characterize the learning and memory capabilities of the neuronal network in training and testing procedures as the number of training patterns and other model parameters vary. The results are then compared with those obtained through simulations with firing-rate-based neuronal network models.</description>

      <title>Topological defects in multi-layered swarming bacteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects, which are singular points in a director field, play a major role in shaping active systems. Here, we experimentally study topological defects and the flow patterns around them, that are formed during the highly rapid dynamics of swarming bacteria. The results are compared to the predictions of two-dimensional active nematics. We show that, even though some of the assumptions underlying the theory do not hold, the swarm dynamics is in agreement with two-dimensional nematic theory. In particular, we look into the multi-layered structure of the swarm, which is an important feature of real, natural colonies, and find a strong coupling between layers. Our results suggest that the defect-charge density is hyperuniform, i.e., that long range density-fluctuations are suppressed.</description>
