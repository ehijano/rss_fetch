      <title>Three-Dimensional Millimeter-Wave Imaging Using Active Incoherent Fourier Processing and Pulse Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel three-dimensional (3D) imaging approach that combines two-dimensional spatial Fourier-domain imaging techniques with traditional radar pulse compression to recover both cross-range and down-range scene information. The imaging system employs four transmitters, three of which emit spatially and temporally incoherent noise signals, while the fourth transmits a known linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulsed signal. The spatial incoherence of the noise signals enables sampling of the 2D spatial Fourier spectrum of the scene from which two-dimensional cross-range (azimuth and elevation) images can be formed via interferometric processing. Simultaneously, the LFM signal enables high-resolution downrange imaging through matched filtering. The received signals consist of a superposition of the noise sources and the known pulse allowing for joint recovery of all three dimensions. We describe the system architecture and waveform design, and demonstrate the imaging technique using both simulations with a linear array and experimental data from a 38 GHz active incoherent millimeter-wave imaging system with 23-element randomized array. Results show the reconstruction of targets in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>A RIS-Enabled Computational Radar Coincidence Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative imaging method using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) by combining radar coincidence imaging (RCI) and computational imaging techniques. In the proposed framework, RISs simultaneously redirect beams toward a desired region of interest (ROI). The interference of these beams forms spatially diverse speckle patterns that carry information about the entire ROI. As a result, this method can take advantage of the benefits of both random patterns and spotlight imaging. Since the speckle pattern is formed by directive beams (instead of random patterns typically used in computational imaging), this approach results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced clutter. In contrast to raster scanning, which requires the number of measurements to be at least equal to the number of unknowns, our proposed approach follows a computational imaging framework and can obtain high-quality images even when only a few measurements are taken. Using numerical simulation, we demonstrate this method's capabilities and contrast it against other conventional techniques. The proposed imaging approach can be applied to security screening, wireless user tracking, and activity recognition.</description>

      <title>mmFlux: Crowd Flow Analytics with Commodity mmWave MIMO Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift, dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework, underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.</description>

      <title>Discrete Beamforming Optimization for RISs with a Limited Phase Range and Amplitude Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the received power at a user equipment via reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) characterized by phase-dependent amplitude (PDA) and discrete phase shifts over a limited phase range. Given complex RIS coefficients, that is, discrete phase shifts and PDAs, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimal solution. To this end, we propose an optimal search algorithm that is proven to converge in linear time within at most NK steps, significantly outperforming the exhaustive search approach that would otherwise be needed for RISs with amplitude attenuation. Furthermore, we introduce a practical quantization framework for PDA-introduced RISs termed amplitude-introduced polar quantization (APQ), and extend it to a novel algorithm named extended amplitude-introduced polar quantization (EAPQ) that works with geometric projections. We derive closed-form expressions to assess how closely the performance of the proposed RIS configuration can approximate the ideal case with continuous phases and no attenuation. Our analysis reveals that increasing the number of discrete phases beyond K = 4 yields only marginal gains, regardless of attenuation levels, provided the RIS has a sufficiently wide phase range R. Furthermore, we also show and quantify that when the phase range R is limited, the performance is sensitive to attenuation for larger R, and sensitive to R when there is less attenuation. Finally, the proposed optimal algorithm provides a generic upper bound that could serve as a benchmark for discrete beamforming in RISs with amplitude constraints.</description>

      <title>Featureless Wireless Communications using Enhanced Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly autoencoders (AEs), have gained significant attention in wireless communication systems. This paper investigates using an AE to generate featureless signals with a low probability of detection and interception (LPD/LPI). Firstly, we introduce a novel loss function that adds a KL divergence term to the categorical cross entropy, enhancing the noise like characteristics of AE-generated signals while preserving block error rate (BLER). Secondly, to support long source message blocks for the AE's inputs, we replace one-hot inputs of source blocks with binary inputs pre-encoded by conventional error correction coding schemes. The AE's outputs are then decoded back to the source blocks using the same scheme. This design enables the AE to learn the coding structure, yielding superior BLER performance on coded blocks and the BLER of the source blocks is further decreased by the error correction decoder. Moreover, we also validate the AE based communication system in the over-the-air communication. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the featureless properties of AE signals and significantly reduce the BLER of message blocks, underscoring the promise of our AE-based approach for secure and reliable wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Power Amplifier Distortion for Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to physical layer security (PLS) by leveraging power amplifier (PA) nonlinear distortion through distortion-aware precoding. While some conventional PLS techniques inject artificial noise orthogonal to legitimate channels, we demonstrate that inherent PA nonlinearities typically considered undesirable can be exploited to enhance security. The zero 3rd order (Z3RO) precoder applies a negative polarity to several antennas to cancel the PA distortion at the user location, resulting in distortion being transmitted in non-user locations. Redirecting the distortion to non-user locations creates interference for potential eavesdroppers, lowering their signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR). Numerical simulations reveal that the Z3RO precoder achieves up to a $2.5\times$ improvement in secrecy rate compared to conventional maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding under a $10\%$ outage probability, SNR of $32$ dB and $-5$ dB input back-off (IBO) where the PAs enter the saturation regime.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted ISAC Systems for Industrial Revolution 6.0: Exploring the Near-field and Far-field Coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged as a key technology for realizing the vision of Industry 6.0, requiring the seamless integration of diverse connected devices. In particular, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) plays a critical role in supporting real-time control and automation within IIoT systems. In this paper, we explore reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted ISAC systems for IIoT in the coexistence of near-field and far-field regions. The system consists of a full-duplex access point (AP), a RIS and multiple IIoT devices, where the near-field devices simultaneously perform sensing and communication, while the far-field devices rely on a RIS-assisted communication. To enhance spectral efficiency for both sensing and communication functionalities, we consider the use of both traditional sensing-only (SO) and ISAC frequency bands. Moreover, uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is employed to facilitate the sequential decoding of superimposed communication and sensing signals from IIoT devices. To maximize sensing accuracy in terms of Cram${\Grave{\textrm{e}}}$r-Rao bound (CRB), we formulate a joint optimization of RIS phase shift, bandwidth splitting ratio and receive beamforming vector subject to the minimum data rate requirements of IIoT devices and resource budget constraints. The algorithmic solution is developed via the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based alternating optimization (AO) method with the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) technique. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional methods relying solely on either ISAC or SO band by achieving superior performance across RIS and device configurations, while ensuring robust ISAC performance under the near-field and far-field coexistence scenarios.</description>

      <title>Consistent and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Bearing-only Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of signal source localization using bearing-only measurements. Initially, we present easily verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment to ensure the asymptotic identifiability of the model and demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose a two-step estimator that shares the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of measurements. The primary challenge lies in obtaining a preliminary consistent estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear least-squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator. The key to this process is obtaining a consistent estimator of the variance of the sine of the noise by taking the reciprocal of the maximum eigenvalue of a specially constructed matrix from the data. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Signal Prediction for Loss Mitigation in Tactile Internet: A Leader-Follower Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile Internet (TI) requires achieving ultra-low latency and highly reliable packet delivery for haptic signals. In the presence of packet loss and delay, the signal prediction method provides a viable solution for recovering the missing signals. To this end, we introduce the Leader-Follower (LeFo) approach based on a cooperative Stackelberg game, which enables both users and robots to learn and predict actions. With accurate prediction, the teleoperation system can safely relax its strict delay requirements. Our method achieves high prediction accuracy, ranging from 80.62% to 95.03% for remote robot signals at the Human ($H$) side and from 70.44% to 89.77% for human operation signals at the remote Robot ($R$) side. We also establish an upper bound for maximum signal loss using Taylor Expansion, ensuring robustness.</description>

      <title>Flying Base Stations for Offshore Wind Farm Monitoring and Control: Holistic Performance Evaluation and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring reliable and low-latency communication in offshore wind farms is critical for efficient monitoring and control, yet remains challenging due to the harsh environment and lack of infrastructure. This paper investigates a flying base station (FBS) approach for wide-area monitoring and control in the UK Hornsea offshore wind farm project. By leveraging mobile, flexible FBS platforms in the remote and harsh offshore environment, the proposed system offers real-time connectivity for turbines without the need for deploying permanent infrastructure at the sea. We develop a detailed and practical end-to-end latency model accounting for five key factors: flight duration, connection establishment, turbine state information upload, computational delay, and control transmission, to provide a holistic perspective often missing in prior studies. Furthermore, we combine trajectory planning, beamforming, and resource allocation into a multi-objective optimization framework for the overall latency minimization, specifically designed for large-scale offshore wind farm deployments. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method in minimizing latency and enhancing efficiency in FBS-assisted offshore monitoring across various power levels, while consistently outperforming baseline designs.</description>

      <title>Interpretable EEG-to-Image Generation with Semantic Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes -- generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization in RIS-aided wireless networks. The use of active and nearly-passive RISs are compared and their trade-off in terms of SEE is analyzed. Considering both perfect and statistical channel state information, two SEE maximization algorithms are developed to optimize the transmit powers of the mobile users, the RIS reflection coefficients, and the base station receive filters. Numerical results quantify the trade-off between active and nearly-passive RISs in terms of SEE, with active RISs yielding worse SEE values as the static power consumed by each reflecting element increases.</description>

      <title>Robust Multimodal Learning Framework For Intake Gesture Detection Using Contactless Radar and Wearable IMU Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated food intake gesture detection plays a vital role in dietary monitoring, enabling objective and continuous tracking of eating behaviors to support better health outcomes. Wrist-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) have been widely used for this task with promising results. More recently, contactless radar sensors have also shown potential. This study explores whether combining wearable and contactless sensing modalities through multimodal learning can further improve detection performance. We also address a major challenge in multimodal learning: reduced robustness when one modality is missing. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal temporal convolutional network with cross-modal attention (MM-TCN-CMA), designed to integrate IMU and radar data, enhance gesture detection, and maintain performance under missing modality conditions. A new dataset comprising 52 meal sessions (3,050 eating gestures and 797 drinking gestures) from 52 participants is developed and made publicly available. Experimental results show that the proposed framework improves the segmental F1-score by 4.3% and 5.2% over unimodal Radar and IMU models, respectively. Under missing modality scenarios, the framework still achieves gains of 1.3% and 2.4% for missing radar and missing IMU inputs. This is the first study to demonstrate a robust multimodal learning framework that effectively fuses IMU and radar data for food intake gesture detection.</description>

While PCS improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping. This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe clipping distortion conditions.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decorrelation-Based Anomaly Detection for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a vital role across a wide range of real-world domains by identifying data instances that deviate from expected patterns, potentially signaling critical events such as system failures, fraudulent activities, or rare medical conditions. The demand for real-time AD has surged with the rise of the (Industrial) Internet of Things, where massive volumes of multivariate sensor data must be processed instantaneously. Real-time AD requires methods that not only handle high-dimensional streaming data but also operate in a single-pass manner, without the burden of storing historical instances, thereby ensuring minimal memory usage and fast decision-making. We propose DAD, a novel real-time decorrelation-based anomaly detection method for multivariate time series, based on an online decorrelation learning approach. Unlike traditional proximity-based or reconstruction-based detectors that process entire data or windowed instances, DAD dynamically learns and monitors the correlation structure of data sample by sample in a single pass, enabling efficient and effective detection. To support more realistic benchmarking practices, we also introduce a practical hyperparameter tuning strategy tailored for real-time anomaly detection scenarios. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAD achieves the most consistent and superior performance across diverse anomaly types compared to state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, its robustness to increasing dimensionality makes it particularly well-suited for real-time, high-dimensional data streams. Ultimately, DAD not only strikes an optimal balance between detection efficacy and computational efficiency but also sets a new standard for real-time, memory-constrained anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Generic Speech Enhancement with Self-Supervised Representation Space Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-channel speech enhancement is utilized in various tasks to mitigate the effect of interfering signals. Conventionally, to ensure the speech enhancement performs optimally, the speech enhancement has needed to be tuned for each task. Thus, generalizing speech enhancement models to unknown downstream tasks has been challenging. This study aims to construct a generic speech enhancement front-end that can improve the performance of back-ends to solve multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we propose a novel training criterion that minimizes the distance between the enhanced and the ground truth clean signal in the feature representation domain of self-supervised learning models. Since self-supervised learning feature representations effectively express high-level speech information useful for solving various downstream tasks, the proposal is expected to make speech enhancement models preserve such information. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposal improves the performance of multiple speech tasks while maintaining the perceptual quality of the enhanced signal.</description>

      <title>Smart Timing Synchronization for Small Data Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular Internet-of-things (C-IoT) user equipments (UEs) typically transmit periodic but small amounts of uplink data to the base station. To avoid undergoing a traditional random access procedure prior to every transmission, 5th generation (5G) and newer systems use configured grants for small data transmission (CG-SDT), which is equivalent to its long-term evolution (LTE) counterpart of preconfigured uplink resources (PURs)-based transmission. CG-SDT configures uplink resources to UEs in advance for transmission without a random access procedure. A prerequisite for CG-SDT is that the UEs must use a valid timing advance (TA). This is done by validating a previously held TA before CG-SDT. While this validation is trivial for stationary UEs, mobile UEs often encounter conditions where the previous TA is no longer valid and a new one is to be requested by falling back to legacy random access procedures. This limits the applicability of CG-SDT in mobile UEs. To this end, we propose UE-native smart timing synchronization techniques to counter this drawback and ensure a near-universal adoption of CG-SDT. We introduce new machine learning-aided solutions for validation and prediction of TA for UEs with any type of mobility. We perform comprehensive simulation evaluations across different types of communication environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in predicting the TA.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis of Distribution-Free Confidence Ellipsoids for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The least squares (LS) estimate is the archetypical solution of linear regression problems. The asymptotic Gaussianity of the scaled LS error is often used to construct approximate confidence ellipsoids around the LS estimate, however, for finite samples these ellipsoids do not come with strict guarantees, unless some strong assumptions are made on the noise distributions. The paper studies the distribution-free Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm which can construct non-asymptotically guaranteed confidence ellipsoids under mild assumptions, such as independent and symmetric noise terms. These ellipsoids have the same center and orientation as the classical asymptotic ellipsoids, only their radii are different, which radii can be computed by convex optimization. Here, we establish high probability non-asymptotic upper bounds for the sizes of SPS outer ellipsoids for linear regression problems and show that the volumes of these ellipsoids decrease at the optimal rate. Finally, the difference between our theoretical bounds and the empirical sizes of the regions are investigated experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML)-based feedback channel coding has garnered significant research interest in the past few years. However, there has been limited research exploring ML approaches in the so-called "two-way" setting where two users jointly encode messages and feedback for each other over a shared channel. In this work, we present a general architecture for ML-based two-way feedback coding, and show how several popular one-way schemes can be converted to the two-way setting through our framework. We compare such schemes against their one-way counterparts, revealing error-rate benefits of ML-based two-way coding in certain signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. We then analyze the tradeoffs between error performance and computational overhead for three state-of-the-art neural network coding models instantiated in the two-way paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the mathematical modeling and compensation of stochastic discrete time clock jitter in Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Two novel, computationally efficient de-jittering sample pilots-based algorithms for baseband signals are proposed: one consisting in solving a sequence of weighted least-squares problems and another that fully leverages the correlated jitter structure in a Kalman filter-type routine. Alongside, a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical analysis of the linearization errors committed is presented, and the work is complemented with extensive synthetic simulations and performance benchmarking with the scope of gauging and stress-testing the techniques in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>C3T: Cross-modal Transfer Through Time for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unlock the potential of diverse sensors, we investigate a method to transfer knowledge between time-series modalities using a multimodal \textit{temporal} representation space for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Specifically, we explore the setting where the modality used in testing has no labeled data during training, which we refer to as Unsupervised Modality Adaptation (UMA). We categorize existing UMA approaches as Student-Teacher or Contrastive Alignment methods. These methods typically compress continuous-time data samples into single latent vectors during alignment, inhibiting their ability to transfer temporal information through real-world temporal distortions. To address this, we introduce Cross-modal Transfer Through Time (C3T), which preserves temporal information during alignment to handle dynamic sensor data better. C3T achieves this by aligning a set of temporal latent vectors across sensing modalities. Our extensive experiments on various camera+IMU datasets demonstrate that C3T outperforms existing methods in UMA by at least 8% in accuracy and shows superior robustness to temporal distortions such as time-shift, misalignment, and dilation. Our findings suggest that C3T has significant potential for developing generalizable models for time-series sensor data, opening new avenues for various multimodal applications.</description>

      <title>Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.</description>

      <title>Token-Domain Multiple Access: Exploiting Semantic Orthogonality for Collision Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Token communications is an emerging generative semantic communication concept that reduces transmission rates by using context and transformer-based token processing, with tokens serving as universal semantic units. In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as ToDMA, where a large number of devices share a tokenizer and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, the source signal is tokenized into sequences, with each token modulated into a codeword. Codewords from multiple devices are transmitted simultaneously, resulting in overlap at the receiver. The receiver detects the transmitted tokens, assigns them to their respective sources, and mitigates token collisions by leveraging context and semantic orthogonality across the devices' messages. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed ToDMA framework outperforms context-unaware orthogonal and non-orthogonal communication methods in image transmission tasks, achieving lower latency and better image quality.</description>

      <title>Sensing Rate Optimization for Multi-Band Cooperative ISAC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been recognized as one of the key technologies for future wireless networks, which potentially need to operate in multiple frequency bands to satisfy ever-increasing demands for both communication and sensing services. Motivated by this, we consider the sum sensing rate (SR) optimization for a cooperative ISAC system with linear precoding, where each base station (BS) works in a different frequency band. With this aim, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the semi-definite rank relaxation that introduces covariance matrices as optimization variables, and we apply the inner approximation (IA) method to deal with the nonconvexity of the resulting problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm increases the SR by approximately 25 % and 40 % compared to the case of equal power distribution in a cooperative ISAC system with two and three BSs, respectively. Additionally, the algorithm converges in only a few iterations, while its most beneficial implementation scenario is in the low power regime</description>

      <title>Radiation Footprint Control in Cell-Free Cooperative ISAC: Optimal Joint BS Activation and Beamforming Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coordinated beamforming across distributed base stations (BSs) in cell-free wireless infrastructure can efficiently support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) users by enhancing resource sharing and suppressing interference in the spatial domain. However, intensive coordination among distributed BSs within the ISAC-enabled network poses risks of generating substantial interference to other coexisting networks sharing the same spectrum, while also incurring elevated costs from energy consumption and signaling exchange. To address these challenges, this paper develops an interference-suppressed and cost-efficient cell-free ISAC network, which opportunistically and cooperatively orchestrates distributed radio resources to accommodate the competing demands of sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) services. Specifically, we conceive a radiation footprint control mechanism that autonomously suppresses interference across the entire signal propagation space to safeguard other networks without exchanging channel knowledge signaling. Then, we propose joint BS activation and beamforming coordination to dynamically activate appropriate BSs and orchestrate their spatial beams for service provisioning. Building upon this framework, we formulate a cost-efficient utility maximization problem that considers individual S\&amp;C demands and location-dependent radiation footprint constraints. Since this results in a non-convex optimization problem, we develop a monotonic optimization embedded branch-and-bound (MO-BRB) algorithm to find the optimal solution. Additionally, we apply a low-complexity iterative method to obtain near-optimal solutions. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal Dynamic Metasurface Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are an emerging technology for next-generation wireless base stations, distinguished by hybrid analog/digital beamforming capabilities with low hardware complexity. However, the intrinsic coupling between meta-atoms is fixed by static waveguide or cavity structures in existing DMAs, which fundamentally constrains the achievable performance. Here, we introduce reconfigurable intrinsic coupling mechanisms between meta-atoms, yielding finer control over the DMA's analog signal processing capabilities. This novel hardware is coined "beyond-diagonal DMA" (BD-DMA), in line with established BD-RIS terminology. Considering realistic hardware constraints, we derive a physics-consistent system model revealing (correlated) "beyond-diagonal" programmability. We also present an equivalent formulation with (uncorrelated) "diagonal" programmability. Based on the latter, we propose a general and efficient mutual-coupling-aware optimization algorithm. Physics-consistent simulations validate the performance enhancement enabled by reconfigurable intrinsic coupling mechanisms in BD-DMAs. The BD-DMA benefits grow with the mutual coupling strength.</description>
