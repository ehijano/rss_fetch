      <title>Two atoms in a harmonic trap with spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of two harmonically trapped atoms in the presence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The two-body energy spectrum is numerically calculated by utilizing the exact diagonalization method. We analyze how the degeneracy of energy levels is lifted under the interplay between the interatomic interaction and spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The exact numerical results show an excellent agreement with that of perturbation theory in the weak-interaction limit, as well as that in the absence of spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling. The properties of correlations between the two atoms are also discussed with respect to the interaction strength. The findings in this work may provide valuable insights into few-body physics subjected to spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling, and the possible experimental detection of spectrum functions in many-body systems, such as radio-frequency spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Collisional dynamics of symmetric two-dimensional quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collisional dynamics of two symmetric droplets with equal intraspecies scattering lengths and particle number density for each component is studied by solving the corresponding extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two dimensions by including a logarithmic correction term in the usual contact interaction. We find the merging droplet after collision experiences a quadrupole oscillation in its shape and the oscillation period is found to be independent of the incidental momentum for small droplets. With increasing collision momentum the colliding droplets may separate into two, or even more, and finally into small pieces of droplets. For these dynamical phases, we manage to present boundaries determined by the remnant particle number in the central area and the damped oscillation of the quadrupole mode. A stability peak for the existence of droplets emerges at the critical particle number $N_c \simeq 48$ for the quasi-Gaussian and flat-top shapes of the droplets.</description>

      <title>Formation of Rydberg Crystals Induced by Quantum Melting in One-Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in frustrated systems can lead to the emergence of complex many-body phases. However, the role of quantum fluctuations in frustration-free lattices is less explored and could provide an interesting avenue for exploring new physics, and perhaps easier to realize compared to frustrated lattice systems. Using Rydberg atoms with tunable interactions as a platform, we leverage strong van der Waals interactions and obtain a constrained model in one dimension with non-local fluctuations given by dipolar interactions alongside local fluctuations. The combined effect of such processes leads to intrinsically quantum-ordered Rydberg crystals through the order-by-disorder mechanism. Finite-size analyses indicate that combined fluctuations drive the transition from disordered to ordered phases, contrary to the expected direction. We provide a theoretical description to understand the physics of order-by-disorder in one-dimensional systems, which are typically seen only in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Towards a zero magnetic field environment for ultracold atoms experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimization of the magnetic field plays a crucial role in ultracold gas research. For instance, the contact interaction dominates all the other energy scales in the zero magnetic field limit, giving rise to novel quantum phases of matter. However, lowering magnetic fields well below the mG level is often challenging in ultracold gas experiments. In this article, we apply Landau-Zener spectroscopy to characterize and reduce the magnetic field on an ultracold gas of sodium atoms to a few tens of {\mu}G. The lowest magnetic field achieved here opens to observing novel phases of matter with ultracold spinor Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Moir\'e Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work intends to extend the moir\'e physics to three dimensions. Three-dimensional moir\'e patterns can be realized in ultracold atomic gases by coupling two spin states in spin-dependent optical lattices with a relative twist, a structure currently unachievable in solid-state materials. We give the commensurate conditions under which the three-dimensional moir\'e pattern features a periodic structure, termed a three-dimensional moir\'e crystal. We emphasize a key distinction of three-dimensional moir\'e physics: in three dimensions, the twist operation generically does not commute with the rotational symmetry of the original lattice, unlike in two dimensions, where these two always commute. Consequently, the moir\'e crystal can exhibit a crystalline structure that differs from the original underlying lattice. We demonstrate that twisting a simple cubic lattice can generate various crystal structures. This capability of altering crystal structures by twisting offers a broad range of tunability for three-dimensional band structures.</description>

      <title>Canonical vs. Grand Canonical Ensemble for Bosonic Gases under Harmonic Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the general relation between canonical and grand canonical ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We begin our discussion by deriving, with an alternative approach, some standard results first obtained by Kac and coworkers in the late 1970s. Then, motivated by the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of trapped gases with a fixed number of atoms, which is well described by the canonical ensemble and by the recent groundbreaking experimental realization of BEC with photons in a dye-filled optical micro-cavity under genuine grand canonical conditions, we apply our formalism to a system of non-interacting Bose particles confined in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. We discuss in detail the mathematical origin of the inequivalence of ensembles observed in the condensed phase, giving place to the so-called grand canonical catastrophe of density fluctuations. We also provide explicit analytical expressions for the internal energy and specific heat and compare them with available experimental data. For these quantities, we show the equivalence of ensembles in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant compiling of classically hard IQP circuits on hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing computationally complex quantum circuits in the presence of noise and imperfections is a challenging task. While fault-tolerant quantum computing provides a route to reducing noise, it requires a large overhead for generic algorithms. Here, we develop and analyze a hardware-efficient, fault-tolerant approach to realizing complex sampling circuits. We co-design the circuits with the appropriate quantum error correcting codes for efficient implementation in a reconfigurable neutral atom array architecture, constituting what we call a fault-tolerant compilation of the sampling algorithm. Specifically, we consider a family of $[[2^D , D, 2]]$ quantum error detecting codes whose transversal and permutation gate set can realize arbitrary degree-$D$ instantaneous quantum polynomial (IQP) circuits. Using native operations of the code and the atom array hardware, we compile a fault-tolerant and fast-scrambling family of such IQP circuits in a hypercube geometry, realized recently in the experiments by Bluvstein et al. [Nature 626, 7997 (2024)]. We develop a theory of second-moment properties of degree-$D$ IQP circuits for analyzing hardness and verification of random sampling by mapping to a statistical mechanics model. We provide evidence that sampling from hypercube IQP circuits is classically hard to simulate and analyze the linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) in comparison to the average fidelity. To realize a fully scalable approach, we first show that Bell sampling from degree-$4$ IQP circuits is classically intractable and can be efficiently validated. We further devise new families of $[[O(d^D),D,d]]$ color codes of increasing distance $d$, permitting exponential error suppression for transversal IQP sampling. Our results highlight fault-tolerant compiling as a powerful tool in co-designing algorithms with specific error-correcting codes and realistic hardware.</description>

      <title>Transitionless Quantum Driving of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) make the fast preparation of many-body states possible, circumventing the limitations of adiabatic strategies. We propose a fast STA protocol for generating interacting states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by counter-diabatic driving, stirring the dynamics with an auxiliary control field. To this end, we exploit the equivalence between the time-dependent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an ensemble of quantum oscillators with driven mass and frequency. We specify the closed-form expression of the counterdiabatic control and demonstrate its efficiency in suppressing excitations.</description>

      <title>Novel Topological Insulators with Hybrid-order Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators (TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in various energy, these novel TIs exhibit a remarkable coexsitence of first-order gapless modes and higher-order Fermi-arc states, behaving as a hybrid between the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel $d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$, revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological invariants acossiated with additional crystallline symmetries is also demonstrated. We then discuss the conventional topological phase transitions from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meawhile, we present the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs. Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in optical lattices using ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Exact Universal Characterization of Chiral-Symmetric Higher-Order Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing a series of Bott indices formulated through polynomials of position operators, we establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing topological zero-energy corner states in systems with chiral symmetry. Our framework covers systems with arbitrary shape, including topological phases that are not characterizable by previously proposed invariants such as multipole moments or multipole chiral numbers. A key feature of our framework is its ability to capture the real-space pattern of zero-energy corner states. We provide a rigorous analytical proof of its higher-order correspondence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory, we examine several model systems with representative patterns of zero-energy corner states that previous frameworks fail to classify.</description>

      <title>Two-axis twisting using Floquet-engineered XYZ spin models with polar molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions. The precise tunability of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both microwave and dc electric fields makes the molecular system particularly suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics. Here, we used Floquet engineering to realize interesting quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold KRb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a dc electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics, setting the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in 2D layers. In the future, Floquet-engineered Hamiltonians could generate entangled states for molecule-based precision measurement or could take advantage of the rich molecular structure for quantum simulation of multi-level systems.</description>

      <title>Universality for Three Bosons with Large, Negative Effective Range: Aspects and Addenda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resummed-Range Effective Field Theory is the consistent non-relativistic Effective Field Theory of point interactions in systems with large two-body scattering length $a$ and an effective range $r_0$ large in magnitude but negative. Its leading order is non-perturbative, and its observables depend only on the dimensionless ratio $\xi:=2r_0/a$ once $|r_0|$ is chosen as base unit. This presentation highlights aspects for three identical spinless bosons and adds details to a previous discussion [1]. At leading order, no three-body interaction is needed. A ground state exists only in the range $0.366\ldots\ge\xi\ge-8.72\ldots$, and excited states display self-similarity and Discrete Scale Invariance, with small corrections for nonzero $r_0$.</description>
