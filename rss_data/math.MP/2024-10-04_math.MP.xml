      <title>An index for invertible phases of two-dimensional quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an index for invertible phases of two-dimensional fermionic and bosonic quantum spin systems without any additional symmetry. Conjecturally, it provides a microscopic definition of an invariant related to the chiral central charge of the boundary modes $c_- \bmod 24$ when the effective conformal field theory description is valid. Using this index, we prove that free fermionic systems with Chern number $\nu \bmod 48 \neq 0$ are in a non-trivial invertible phase.</description>

      <title>Band spectrum singularities for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a systematic framework to study the dispersion surfaces of Schr\"odinger operators $ -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R})$ is periodic with respect to a lattice $\Lambda \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and respects the symmetries of $\Lambda$. Our analysis relies on an abstract result, that expands on a seminal work of Fefferman--Weinstein \cite{feffer12}: if an operator depends analytically on a parameter, then so do its eigenvalues and eigenprojectors away from a discrete set. As an application, we describe the generic structure of some singularities in the band spectrum of Schr\"odinger operators invariant under the three-dimensional simple, body-centered and face-centered cubic lattices.</description>

      <title>Absolutely continuous spectrum for truncated topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if a topological insulator is truncated along a curve that separates the plane in two sufficiently large regions, then the edge system admits absolutely continuous spectrum. Our approach combines a recent version of the bulk-edge correspondence along curves that separates geometry and intrinsic conductance [DZ24], with a result about absolutely continuous spectrum for straight edges [BW22].</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler to Efficiently Sample Invariant Distribution of Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling invariant distributions from an Ito diffusion process presents a significant challenge in stochastic simulation. Traditional numerical solvers for stochastic differential equations require both a fine step size and a lengthy simulation period, resulting in both biased and correlated samples. Current deep learning-based method solves the stationary Fokker--Planck equation to determine the invariant probability density function in form of deep neural networks, but they generally do not directly address the problem of sampling from the computed density function. In this work, we introduce a framework that employs a weak generative sampler (WGS) to directly generate independent and identically distributed (iid) samples induced by a transformation map derived from the stationary Fokker--Planck equation. Our proposed loss function is based on the weak form of the Fokker--Planck equation, integrating normalizing flows to characterize the invariant distribution and facilitate sample generation from the base distribution. Our randomized test function circumvents the need for mini-max optimization in the traditional weak formulation. Distinct from conventional generative models, our method neither necessitates the computationally intensive calculation of the Jacobian determinant nor the invertibility of the transformation map. A crucial component of our framework is the adaptively chosen family of test functions in the form of Gaussian kernel functions with centres selected from the generated data samples. Experimental results on several benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which offers both low computational costs and excellent capability in exploring multiple metastable states.</description>

      <title>Curvature of an exotic 7-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the Gromoll-Meyer sphere, one of Milnor's exotic $7$-spheres. We focus on a Kaluza-Klein Ansatz, with a round $S^4$ as base space, unit $S^3$ as fibre, and $k=1,2$ $SU(2)$ instantons as gauge fields, where all quantities admit an elegant description in quaternionic language. The metric's moduli space coincides with the $k=1,2$ instantons' moduli space quotiented by the isometry of the base, plus an additional $\mathbb{R}^+$ factor corresponding to the radius of the base, $r$. We identify a "center" of the $k=2$ instanton moduli space with enhanced symmetry. This $k=2$ solution is used together with the maximally symmetric $k=1$ solution to obtain a metric of maximal isometry, $SO(3)\times O(2)$, and to compute its Ricci tensor explicitly. This allows us to put a bound on $r$ to ensure positive Ricci curvature, which implies various energy conditions for an $8$-dimensional static space-time. The construction opens for a concrete examination of the properties of the sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions for equivariant wave maps on a $2+1$ dimensional wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional QCD at finite density and its 't Hooft-Veneziano limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An exact solution of one-dimensional lattice gauge theory at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential is reviewed for the gauge groups $G=Z(N),U(N),SU(N)$ for all values of $N$ and the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Calculated are the partition function, free energy, the Polyakov loop expectation values, baryon density, quark condensate, meson and baryon correlation functions. Detailed analysis of the exact solutions is done for $N=2,3$ with one and two fermion flavors. In the large $N_f$ limit we uncover the Roberge-Weiss phase transition and discuss its remnants at finite $N_f$. In the case of $N_f$ degenerate flavors we also calculate 1) the large $N$ limit, 2) the large $N_f$ limit and 3) the 't Hooft-Veneziano limit of all models. The critical behavior of the models in these limits is studied and the phase structure is described in details. A comparison of all limits with $U(3)$ and $SU(3)$ QCD is also performed. In order to achieve these results we explore several representations of the partition function of one-dimensional QCD obtained and described in the text.</description>

      <title>Towards new relativistic doubly $\kappa$-deformed D=4 quantum phase spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose new noncommutative (NC) models of quantum phase spaces, containing a pair of $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e algebras, with two independent $\kappa$ and $\tilde{\kappa}$-deformations in space-time and fourmomenta sectors. The first quantum phase space can be obtained by contractions $M,R\to \infty$ of recently introduced doubly $\kappa$-deformed $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$-Yang models, with the parameters $M,R$ describing inverse space-time and fourmomenta curvatures and constant four-vectors $a_\mu, b_\mu$ determining one of nine types of $(\kappa,\tilde{\kappa})$ deformations. The second model is provided by the non-linear doubly $\kappa$-deformed TSR algebra spanned by 14 coset $\hat{o}(1,5)/\hat {o}(2)$ generators. The basic algebraic difference between the two models is the following: the first one, described by $\hat{o}(1,5)$ Lie algebra can be supplemented by the Hopf algebra structure, while the second model contains the quantum phase space commutators $[\hat{x}_\mu,\hat{q}_\nu]$ describing the quantum-deformed Heisenberg algebra relations with the standard numerical $i\hbar\eta_{\mu\nu}$ term.</description>

      <title>Qudit-based quantum error-correcting codes from irreducible representations of SU(d)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qudits naturally correspond to multi-level quantum systems, which offer an efficient route towards quantum information processing, but their reliability is contingent upon quantum error correction capabilities. In this paper, we present a general procedure for constructing error-correcting qudit codes through the irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ for any odd integer $d \geq 3.$ Using the Weyl character formula and inner product of characters, we deduce the relevant branching rules, through which we identify the physical Hilbert spaces that contain valid code spaces. We then discuss how two forms of permutation invariance and the Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry of $\mathfrak{su}(d)$ can be exploited to simplify the construction of error-correcting codes. Finally, we use our procedure to construct an infinite class of error-correcting codes encoding a logical qudit into $(d-1)^2$ physical qudits.</description>

      <title>Chaitin Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of Hamiltonians whose phase diagram is guaranteed to have a single phase transition, yet the location of this phase transition is uncomputable. The Hamiltonians $H(\phi)$ describe qudits on a two-dimensional square lattice with translationally invariant, nearest-neighbour interactions tuned by a continuous parameter $\phi\in(0,1]$. For all $\phi\in(0,1]$, $H(\phi)$ is in one of two phases, one a gapless phase, the other a gapped phase. The phase transition occurs when $\phi$ equals the Chaitin's constant $\Omega$, a well-defined real number that encodes the Halting problem, and hence is uncomputable for Turing machines and undecidable for any consistent recursive axiomatization of mathematics. Our result implies that no general algorithm exists to determine the phase diagrams even under the promise that the phase diagram is exceedingly simple, and illustrates how uncomputable numbers may manifest in physical systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct an action of the fundamental groupoid of the Swiss-cheese operad (the parenthesized permutation and braid operad) on $C_1$-cofinite module categories of a vertex operator algebra. Based on this result, we show that when a boundary conformal field theory has locally $C_1$-cofinite chiral symmetry, all operator product expansions converge absolutely on open regions in the configuration spaces of the upper half-plane and define real analytic functions (the correlation functions), independent of orders and parentheses of OPEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma is a medium containing free electrons and cations, where each particle group behaves as a conducting fluid with a single velocity and temperature in the presence of electromagnetic fields. The difference in roles electrons and ions play define the two-fluid description of plasma. This paper examines ion-acoustic waves generated by the particles in both hot and cold plasma using a collisionless "Euler-Poisson" (EP) system. Employing phase-space asymptotic analysis, we establish that for specific wave speeds, EP acquires homoclinic orbits at the steady-state equilibrium and consequently, traveling waves. Combining python and Wolfram Mathematica, we captured visualizations of such behavior in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques proposed in [Sason, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 59, 7118 (2013)] and [Becker, Datta and Jabbour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 69, 4128 (2023)], and building on results from the latter, we construct a globally optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under energy constraints imposed by arbitrary Hamiltonians, satisfying the Gibbs hypothesis. In particular, this provides a precise expression for the modulus of continuity of the von Neumann entropy over the set of states with bounded energy for infinite-dimensional quantum systems. Thus, it completely solves the problem of finding an optimal continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in this setting, which was previously known only for pairs of states which were sufficiently close to each other. This continuity bound follows from a globally optimal semicontinuity bound for the von Neumann entropy under general energy constraints, which is our main technical result.</description>

Abstract: We axiomatize path integral quantization of symplectic manifolds. We prove that this path integral formulation of quantization is equivalent to an abstract operator formulation, ie. abstract coherent state (or Berezin) quantization. We use the corresponding path integral of Poisson manifolds to quantize all complete Riemann surfaces of constant non$\unicode{x2013}$positive curvature and some Poisson structures on the sphere.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an infinite group action on partition functions of WK type, meaning of the type of the partition function $Z^{\rm WK}$ in the famous result of Witten and Kontsevich expressing the partition function of $\psi$-class integrals on the compactified moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ as a $\tau$-function for the Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy. Specifically, the group which acts is the group $\mathcal{G}$ of formal power series of one variable $\varphi(V)=V+O(V^2)$, with group law given by composition, acting in a suitable way on the infinite tuple of variables of the partition functions. In particular, any $\varphi \in \mathcal{G}$ sends the Witten--Kontsevich (WK) partition function $Z^{\rm WK}$ to a new partition function $Z^\varphi$, which we call the WK mapping partition function associated to $\varphi$. We show that the genus zero part of $\log Z^\varphi$ is independent of $\varphi$ and give an explicit recursive description for its higher genus parts (loop equation), and as applications of this obtain relationships of the $\psi$-class integrals to Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and generalized Br\'ezin--Gross--Witten correlators. In a different direction, we use $Z^\varphi$ to construct a new integrable hierarchy, which we call the WK mapping hierarchy associated to $\varphi$. We show that this hierarchy is a bihamiltonian perturbation of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy possessing a $\tau$-structure, and prove that it is a universal object for all such perturbations. Similarly, for any $\varphi\in\mathcal{G}$, we define the Hodge mapping partition function associated to $\varphi$, prove that it is integrable, and study its role in hamiltonian perturbations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy possessing a $\tau$-structure. Finally, we establish a generalized Hodge--WK correspondence relating different Hodge mapping partition functions.</description>

      <title>Interaction and collision of skyrmions in chiral antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions in an antiferromagnet can travel as solitary waves in stark contrast to the situation in ferromagnets. Traveling skyrmion solutions have been found numerically in chiral antiferromagnets. We study head-on collision events between two skyrmions. We find that the result of the collision depends on the initial velocity of the skyrmions. For small velocities, the skyrmions shrink as they approach, then bounce back and eventually acquire almost their initial speed. For larger velocities, the skyrmions approach each other and shrink until they become singular points at some finite separation and are eventually annihilated. Considering skyrmion energetics, we can determine the regimes of the different dynamical behaviors. Using a collective co-ordinate approach, we reproduce the dynamics of the collisions including the variation of the size of the skyrmions and collapse above a critical velocity.</description>

      <title>Reversibility of whole-plane SLE for $\kappa &gt; 8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ is a random fractal curve between two points on the Riemann sphere. Zhan established for $\kappa \leq 4$ that whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ is reversible, meaning invariant in law under conformal automorphisms swapping its endpoints. Miller and Sheffield extended this to $\kappa \leq 8$. We prove whole-plane SLE$_\kappa$ is reversible for $\kappa &gt; 8$, resolving the final case and answering a conjecture of Viklund and Wang. Our argument depends on a novel mating-of-trees theorem of independent interest, where Liouville quantum gravity on the disk is decorated by an independent radial space-filling SLE curve.</description>

      <title>On B type family of Dubrovin-Frobenius manifolds and their integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to D.Zuo and an unpulished work of M.Bertola, there is a two--index series of Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold structures associated to a B type Coxeter group. We study the relations between these structures for the different values of these indices. We show that part of the data of such Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold indexed by $(k,l)$ can be recovered by the $(k+r,l+r)$ Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold. Continuing the program of arXiv:2007.11974 we associate an infinite system of commuting PDEs to these Dubrovin--Frobenius manifolds and show that these PDEs extend the dispersionless BKP hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Solution of the Probabilistic Lambert Problem: Connections with Optimal Mass Transport, Schr\"odinger Bridge and Reaction-Diffusion PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07961v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambert problem originated in orbital mechanics. It concerns with determining the initial velocity for a boundary value problem involving the dynamical constraint due to gravitational potential with additional time horizon and endpoint position constraints. Its solution has application in transferring a spacecraft from a given initial to a given terminal position within prescribed flight time via velocity control. We consider a probabilistic variant of the Lambert problem where the knowledge of the endpoint constraints in position vectors are replaced by the knowledge of their respective joint probability density functions. We show that the Lambert problem with endpoint joint probability density constraints is a generalized optimal mass transport (OMT) problem, thereby connecting this classical astrodynamics problem with a burgeoning area of research in modern stochastic control and stochastic machine learning. This newfound connection allows us to rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of solution for the probabilistic Lambert problem. The same connection also helps to numerically solve the probabilistic Lambert problem via diffusion regularization, i.e., by leveraging further connection of the OMT with the Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SBP). This also shows that the probabilistic Lambert problem with additive dynamic process noise is a generalized SBP, and can be solved numerically using the so-called Schr\"odinger factors, as we do in this work. Our analysis leads to solving a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs where the gravitational potential appears as the reaction rate.</description>

      <title>Comb Channel Lightcone Bootstrap II: Triple-Twist Anomalous Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We advance the multipoint lightcone bootstrap and compute anomalous dimensions of triple-twist operators at large spin. In contrast to the well-studied double-twist operators, triple-twist primaries are highly degenerate so that their anomalous dimension is encoded in a matrix. At large spin, the degeneracy becomes infinite and the matrix becomes an integral operator. We compute this integral operator by studying a particular non-planar crossing equation for six-point functions of scalar operators in a lightcone limit. The bootstrap analysis is based on new formulas for six-point lightcone blocks in the comb-channel. For a consistency check of our results, we compare them to perturbative computations in the epsilon expansion of $\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$ theory. In both cases, we find perfect agreement between perturbative results and bootstrap predictions. As a byproduct of our studies, we complement previous results on triple-twist anomalous dimensions in scalar $\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$ theory at first and second order in epsilon, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation. We use the representation of solution in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions, which is new. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief identity. Finally small and large $x$ asymptotics is obtained using elementary asymptotic methods. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. Our formulas are useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of multisoliton solutions of the gravitational Hartree equation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of multisoliton solutions of the three-dimensional gravitational Hartree equation whose trajectories follow many body dynamics of hyperbolic, parabolic or hyperbolic-parabolic types. The existence of such dynamics was recently proved by Polimeni-Terracini. We also prove the orbital stability of multisolitons whose minimal distance between centers grows linearly in time, with the hyperbolic type as a special case. This work generalizes and improves the result of Krieger-Martel-Rapha\"el on two-soliton solutions, and resolves a question posed in their paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Frenkel's integral representation of the quantum relative entropy provides a natural framework to derive continuity bounds for quantum information measures. Our main general result is a dimension-independent semi-continuity relation for the quantum relative entropy with respect to the first argument. Using it, we obtain a number of results: (1) a tight continuity relation for the conditional entropy in the case where the two states have equal marginals on the conditioning system, resolving a conjecture by Wilde in this special case; (2) a stronger version of the Fannes-Audenaert inequality on quantum entropy; (3) better estimates on the quantum capacity of approximately degradable channels; (4) an improved continuity relation for the entanglement cost; (5) general upper bounds on asymptotic transformation rates in infinite-dimensional entanglement theory; and (6) a proof of a conjecture due to Christandl, Ferrara, and Lancien on the continuity of 'filtered' relative entropy distances.</description>
