      <title>Modeling pedestrian fundamental diagram based on Directional Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding pedestrian dynamics is crucial for appropriately designing pedestrian spaces. The pedestrian fundamental diagram (FD), which describes the relationship between pedestrian flow and density within a given space, characterizes these dynamics. Pedestrian FDs are significantly influenced by the flow type, such as uni-directional, bi-directional, and crossing flows. However, to the authors' knowledge, generalized pedestrian FDs that are applicable to various flow types have not been proposed. This may be due to the difficulty of using statistical methods to characterize the flow types. The flow types significantly depend on the angles of pedestrian movement; however, these angles cannot be processed by standard statistics due to their periodicity. In this study, we propose a comprehensive model for pedestrian FDs that can describe the pedestrian dynamics for various flow types by applying Directional Statistics. First, we develop a novel statistic describing the pedestrian flow type solely from pedestrian trajectory data using Directional Statistics. Then, we formulate a comprehensive pedestrian FD model that can be applied to various flow types by incorporating the proposed statistics into a traditional pedestrian FD model. The proposed model was validated using actual pedestrian trajectory data. The results confirmed that the model effectively represents the essential nature of pedestrian dynamics, such as the capacity reduction due to conflict of crossing flows and the capacity improvement due to the lane formation in bi-directional flows.</description>

      <title>The role of the Allee effect in common-pool resource and its sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The management of common-pool resources is a complex challenge due to the risk of overexploitation and the tragedy of the commons. A novel framework has been introduced to address this issue, focusing on the coevolutionary relationship between human behavior and common-pool resources within a human-environment system. However, the impact of the Allee effect on the coevolution and its resource sustainability is still unexplored. The Allee effect, a biological phenomenon characterized by a correlation between resource availability and growth rate, is a fundamental attribute of numerous natural resources. In this paper, we introduce two coevolutionary models of resource and strategy under replicator dynamics and knowledge feedback by applying the Allee effect to the common-pool resources within human-environment system. These models encapsulate various facets of resource dynamics and the players' behavior, such as resource growth function, the extraction rates, and the strategy update rules. We find that the Allee effect can induce bi-stability and critical transition, leading to either sustainable or unsustainable outcomes depending on the initial condition and parameter configuration. We demonstrate that knowledge feedback enhances the resilience and sustainability of the coevolving system, and these results advances the understanding of human-environment system and management of common-pool resources.</description>
