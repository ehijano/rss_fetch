      <title>The $\overline\partial$-Robin Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the family of operators $\{\mathcal{R}_a\}_{a\in [0,+\infty)}$ associated to the Robin-type problems in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ $$
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u = f &amp; \text{in } \Omega, \\
  2 \bar \nu \partial_{\bar z} u + au = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} $$ and their dependency on the boundary parameter $a$ as it moves along $[0,+\infty)$. In this regard, we study the convergence of such operators in a resolvent sense. We also describe the eigenvalues of such operators and show some of their properties, both for all fixed $a$ and as functions of the parameter $a$. As shall be seen in more detail in a forthcoming paper, the eigenvalues of these operators characterize the positive eigenvalues of quantum dot Dirac operators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the $2D$ temperature-dependent tropical climate model with the sharp decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic stability of a tropical climate model posed on $\bR^2$, with temperature-dependent diffusion in the barotropic mode $u$ and linear damping in the first baroclinic mode $v$. We consider two distinct cases for the barotropic component: one with linear damping and one without. For both cases, we prove the small data global existence of smooth solutions. Furthermore, we establish sharp temporal decay estimates for solutions in arbitrary Sobolev norms $H^m (\bR^2)$, $m \ge 0$.</description>

      <title>Formation of vacuum state and delta-shock in the solution of two-dimensional Riemann problem for zero pressure gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the two-dimensional pressureless Euler equations with three constant Riemann initial data. Our primary focus is on the wave interactions involving contact discontinuities and delta shocks. A distinguishing feature of the solution is the emergence of a delta shock wave which is characterized by a Dirac delta function appearing in both the density and internal energy variables. By exploiting generalized characteristic analysis, nine topologically distinct solution patterns are derived. Some of these configurations exhibit features similar to Mach-reflection and in certain cases, vacuum regions may also develop. To validate the theoretical results, numerical simulations are carried out using a semidiscrete central upwind scheme. The comparison between analytical and numerical results demonstrates excellent agreement, providing</description>

      <title>Compensation effects for anisotropic energies of two-dimensional unit vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the highly anisotropic energy of two-dimensional unit vector fields given by \begin{align*} E_\epsilon(u)= \int_{\Omega} (\mathrm{div}\,u)^2 + \epsilon(\mathrm{curl}\,u)^2\, dx\,, \quad u\colon\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb S^1\, \end{align*}
  in the limit $\epsilon\to 0$. This energy clearly loses control on the full gradient of $u$ as $\epsilon\to 0$, but, adapting tools from hyperbolic conservations laws, we show that it still controls derivatives of order 1/2. In particular, any bounded energy sequence $E_\epsilon(u_\epsilon)\leq C$ is compact in $W^{s,3}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$ for $s&lt;1/2$. Moreover, this order 1/2 of differentiability is optimal, in the sense that any map $u\in W^{1/2,4}(\Omega;\mathbb S^1)$ is a limit of a bounded energy sequence. We also establish compactness of boundary traces in $L^1(\partial\Omega)$, and characterize the $\Gamma$-limit in the simpler case of maps of a single variable and in the case of a thin-film model.</description>

      <title>Stable self-similar singularity formation for infinite energy solutions of the incompressible porous medium equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a special class of infinite energy solutions to the inviscid incompressible porous medium equations (IPM), introduced in Castro-C\'ordoba-Gancedo-Orive [9]. The (IPM) equations then reduce to a one-dimensional nonlocal nonlinear equation, for which an explicit self-similar blow-up solution is found in [9]. We show the stability of this explicit blow-up solution by smooth enough perturbations, and identity a sharp regularity threshold below which it is unstable. The heart of our proof is a change of variables that transforms the study of finite time blow-up solutions, to the study of global-in-time solutions to the Proudman-Johnson equation, which is a reduced equation that appears for special classes of solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equations, and of the inviscid primitive equations (or hydrostatic Euler equations). Our main result is in fact the asymptotic stability with decay estimates for a family of steady states of this reduced equation. It thus also implies the corresponding stability of steady states for the associated classes of solutions to the Euler equations and inviscid primitive equations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of mass-critical Schr\"odinger equation in $ \mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long-time behavior for the mass-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the line
  \[
  i\partial_t u + \partial_x^2 u = |u|^4 u,
  u(0, x) = u_0 \in L_x^2(\Bbb R).
  \] The global well-posedness and scattering for this equation was solved in Dodson [Amer. J. Math. (2016)]. Inspired by the pioneering work of Killip-Visan-Zhang [Amer. J. Math. (2021)], we show that solution can be approximated by a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian system. This system is the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on the rescaled torus $\Bbb R/(L_n\Bbb Z)$ with Fourier truncated nonlinear term. To prove this, we introduce the Fourier truncated mass-critical NLS on $\mathbb{R}$. First, we establish the uniformly global space-time bound for this truncated model on $\mathbb{R}$. Second, we show that the truncated NLS on rescaled torus can be approximated by the truncated equation on $\Bbb R$. Then, using the Gromov theorem, we can show the non-squeezing property for the truncated NLS on torus. The last step to show the non-squeezing property for original NLS is to connect the solution with truncated nonlinearity and a single equation in $\mathbb{R}$, which can be done by performing the nonlinear profile decomposition.
  Our second result is to study the homogenization of the mass-critical inhomogeneous NLS, where we add a $L^\infty$ function $h(nx)$ in front of the nonlinear term. Based on the method of Ntekoume [Comm. PDE, (2020)], we give the sufficient condition on $h$ such that the scattering holds for this inhomogeneous model and show that the solution to inhomogeneous converges to the homogeneous model when $n\to\infty$. As a corollary, we can transfer the non-squeezing property from homogeneous model to inhomogeneous.</description>

      <title>On a global estimate and a Stampacchia-type maximum principle for Lane-Emden systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a global boundedness result for Lane-Emden systems involving general second-order elliptic operators in divergence form and arbitrary positive exponents whose product equals one. Furthermore, we observe that, for this class of systems -- and for certain operators in divergence form, including the case when both operators are the Laplacian -- it is not possible to recover the classical Stampacchia maximum principle as a particular case corresponding to single equations.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the Majda-Biello system in the resonant case on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the following Majda-Biello system in the case $\alpha=4$, which has the most significant resonance effect, on the real line. \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_{t} + u_{xxx} = - v v_x,
  v_{t} + \alpha v_{xxx} = - (uv)_{x},
  (u,v)|_{t=0} = (u_0,v_0) \in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}) \times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}), \end{array} \right. \quad x \in \mathbb{R}, \, t \in \mathbb{R}. \] For Sobolev regularity $s\in[\frac34, 1)$, we establish the global well-posedness by refining the I-method. Previously, the critical index for the local well-posedness was known to be $\frac34$, while the global well-posedness was only obtained for $s\geq 1$. Our global well-posedness result bridges the gap and matches the threshold in the local theory. The main novelty of our approach is to introduce a pair of distinct $I$-operators, tailored to the resonant structure of the Majda-Biello system with $\alpha=4$. This dual-operator framework allows for pointwise control of the multipliers in the modified energies constructed via the multilinear correction technique. These modified energies are almost conserved and provide effective control over the Sobolev norm of the solution globally in time. This new approach has potential applications to other coupled dispersive systems exhibiting strong resonant interactions.</description>

      <title>Segregated solutions for a class of systems with Lotka-Volterra interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence of positive solutions to the system
  $$ -\Delta w_1 - \varepsilon w_1 = \mu_{1} w_1^{p} + \beta w_1 w_2\ \text{in } \Omega,\
  -\Delta w_2 - \varepsilon w_2 = \mu_{2} w_2^{p} + \beta w_1 w_2 \ \text{in } \Omega,\
  w_1 = w_2 = 0 \ \text{on } \partial \Omega,
  $$
  where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{N}$, $N \ge 4$, $ p ={N+2\over N-2}$ and $ \varepsilon $ is positive and sufficiently small. The interaction coefficient $ \beta = \beta(\varepsilon) \to 0 $ as $ \varepsilon \to 0 $.
  We construct a family of segregated solutions to this system, where each component blows-up at a different critical point of the Robin function as $\varepsilon \to 0. The system lacks a variational formulation due to its specific coupling form,
  which leads to essentially different behaviors in the subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and requires an
  appropriate functional settings to carry out the construction.</description>

      <title>Carleman estimate with piecewise weight and applications to inverse problems for first-order transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a first-order transport equation $\ppp_tu(x,t) + (H(x)\cdot\nabla u(x,t)) + p(x)u(x,t) = F(x,t)$ for $x \in \OOO \subset \R^d$, where $\OOO$ is a bounded domain and $0&lt;t&lt;T$. We prove a Carleman estimate for more generous condition on the principal coefficients $H(x)$ than in the existing works. The key is the construction of a piecewise smooth weight function in $x$ according to a suitable decomposition of $\OOO$. Our assumptions on $H$ generalize the conditions in the existing articles, and require that a directed graph created by the corresponding stream field has no closed loops. Then, we apply our Carleman estimate to two inverse problems of determinination of an initial value and one of a spatial factor of a source term, so that we establish Lipschitz stability estimates for the inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative convergence for displacement monotone Mean Field Games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish quantitative convergence results for both open and closed-loop Nash equilibria of N-player stochastic differential games in the setting of Mean Field Games of Controls (MFGC), a class of models where interactions among agents occur through both states and controls. Our analysis covers a general class of non-separable Hamiltonians satisfying a displacement monotonicity condition, along with mild regularity and growth conditions at infinity. A major novelty of our work is the rigorous treatment of a nontrivial fixed-point problem on a space of measures, which arises naturally in the MFGC formulation. Unlike prior works that either restrict to separable Hamiltonians - rendering the fixed-point map trivial - or assume convergence or regularity properties of the fixed point map, we develop a detailed structural analysis of this equation and its N-player analogue. This leads to new regularity results for the fixed-point maps and, in turn, to quantitative convergence of open-loop equilibria. We further derive sharp a priori estimates for the N-player Nash system, enabling us to control the discrepancy between open and closed-loop strategies, and thus to conclude the convergence of closed-loop equilibria. Our framework also accommodates common noise in a natural way.</description>

      <title>Convexity and the degenerate special Lagrangian equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2015 Rubinstein--Solomon introduced the degenerate special Lagrangian equation (DSL) that governs geodesics in the space of positive Lagrangians, showed that subsolutions in the top branch of DSL are convex in space, and raised the question of whether they should be convex in space-time and whether subsolutions in the second branch possess any convexity properties. In 2019, Darvas--Rubinstein gave a partial answer to the first problem by showing subsolutions in the top branch must be bi-convex. We settle both questions. The key new ingredient is a space-time coordinate transformation that preserves the space-time Lagrangian angle and allows for a partial $C^2$ estimate. This also shows that the top two branches of the DSL subequation have a $\star$-product structure in the sense of Ross--Witt-Nystr\"om.</description>

      <title>Existence results for the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model with variable exponent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model where the diffusion coefficient involves a state-dependent variable exponent function $p(\cdot)$. This new theoretically flexible framework generalizes the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. The existence, uniqueness, higher moment and martingale properties of solutions are analyzed. The validity and efficiency of the model is illustrated with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Weak stability by noise for approximations of doubly nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly nonlinear stochastic evolution equations are considered. Upon assuming the additive noise to be rough enough, we prove the existence of probabilistically weak solutions of Friedrichs type and study their uniqueness in law. This entails stability for approximations of stochastic doubly nonlinear equations in a weak probabilistic sense. Such effect is a genuinely stochastic, as doubly nonlinear equations are not even expected to exhibit uniqueness in the deterministic case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct initial data suitable for the Kerr stability conjecture, that is, solutions to the constraint equations on a spacelike hypersurface with boundary entering the black hole horizon that are arbitrarily decaying perturbations of a Kerr initial data set. This results from a more general perturbative construction on any asymptotically flat initial data set with the topology of $\mathbb{R}^3\setminus\{r&lt;1\}$ enjoying some analyticity near and at the boundary. In particular, we design a suitable mixed boundary condition for the elliptic operator of the conformal method in order to exclude the Killing initial data sets (KIDS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A prevalent feature of three-dimensional turbulence is the presence of anomalous dissipation, or that the mean rate of energy dissipation is bounded below by a positive number in the inviscid limit. This is thought to be due to the nonlinear convection term in the Navier Stokes equations stretching vortex tubules and thereby increasing the amount of small scale oscillations within the flow. In this paper, we construct an example of a linear Stokes flow within a sphere that exhibits anomalous dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the speed of convergence in $L^\infty$ norm of the vanishing viscosity process for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with uniformly or strictly convex Hamiltonian terms with superquadratic behavior. Our analysis boosts previous findings on the rate of convergence for this procedure in $L^p$ norms, showing rates in sup-norm of order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^\beta)$, $\beta\in(1/2,1)$, or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon|\log\epsilon|)$ with respect to the vanishing viscosity parameter $\epsilon$, depending on the regularity of the initial datum of the problem and convexity properties of the Hamiltonian. Our proofs are based on integral methods and avoid the use of techniques based on stochastic control or the maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity of the heat flow on ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ spaces: sharpness and rigidities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of the present paper is to provide sharp hypercontractivity bounds of the heat flow $({\sf H}_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ metric measure spaces. The best constant in this estimate involves the asymptotic volume ratio, and its optimality is obtained by means of the sharp $L^2$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality on ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ spaces and a blow-down rescaling argument. Equality holds in this sharp estimate for a prescribed time $t_0&gt;0$ and a non-zero extremizer $f$ if and only if the ${\sf RCD}(0,N)$ space has an $N$-Euclidean cone structure and $f$ is a Gaussian whose dilation factor is reciprocal to $t_0$, up to a multiplicative constant. Applications include an extension of Li's rigidity result, almost rigidities, as well as topological rigidities of non-collapsed ${\sf RCD}(0, N)$ spaces. Our results are new even on complete Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with an overdetermined problem for the $k$-Hessian equation ($1\leq k&lt;\frac n2$) in the exterior domain and prove the corresponding ball characterizations. Since that Weinberger type approach seems to fail to solve the problem, we give a new perspective to solve exterior overdetermined problem by combining two integral identities and geometric inequalities inspired by Brandolini-Nitsch-Salani's results \cite{BNS}. Meanwhile, we establish general monotone formulas to derive geometric inequalities related to $k$-admissible solution $u$ in $\mathbb R^n\setminus\Omega$, where $\Omega$ is smooth, $k$-convex and star-shaped domain, which constructed by Ma-Zhang\cite{MZ} and Xiao\cite{xiao}.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and propagation of chaos for multi-agent models with strategies and diffusive effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A multi-agent model for individuals endowed with strategies and subject to diffusive effects is proposed. The microscopic state of each agent is described by a spatial position and a probability measure, interpreted as a mixed strategy, over a compact metric space. The evolution is governed by a non-local interaction mechanism and by stochastic effects acting on the spatial component of the state. The well-posedness of the multi-agent system and that of a certain McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equation are proved. Eventually, a propagation of chaos result is obtained, which guarantees that the former model converges to the latter as the number of agents goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>ACMP: Allen-Cahn Message Passing with Attractive and Repulsive Forces for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05437v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural message passing is a basic feature extraction unit for graph-structured data considering neighboring node features in network propagation from one layer to the next. We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ACMP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing posterior functionals in general high-dimensional statistical models with possibly non-log-concave likelihood functions is considered. Based on the proof strategy of Nickl and Wang (2022), but using only local likelihood conditions and without relying on M-estimation theory, nonasymptotic statistical and computational guarantees are provided for a gradient based MCMC algorithm. Given a suitable initialiser, these guarantees scale polynomially in key algorithmic quantities. The abstract results are applied to several concrete statistical models, including density estimation, nonparametric regression with generalised linear models and a canonical statistical non-linear inverse problem from PDEs.</description>

      <title>First order operators on shrinking graph-like spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the convergence of first order operators on a thickened graph (a graph-like space) towards a similar operator on the underlying metric graph. On the graph-like space, the first order operator is of the form exterior derivative (the gradient) on functions and its adjoint (the negative divergence) on closed 1-forms (irrotational vector fields). Under the assumption that each cross section of the tubular edge neighbourhood is convex, that each vertex neighbourhood is simply connected and under suitable uniformity assumptions (which hold in particular, if the spaces are compact) we establish generalised norm resolvent convergence of the first order operator on the graph-like space towards the one on the metric graph. The square of the first order operator is of Laplace type; on the metric graph, the function (0-form) component is the usual standard (Kirchhoff) Laplacian. A key ingredient in the proof is a uniform Gaffney estimate: such an estimate follows from an equality relating here the divergence operator with all (weak) partial derivatives and a curvature term, together with a (localised) Sobolev trace estimate.</description>

      <title>On the non-convexity issue in the radial Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical approach to the Calder\'on problem is to estimate the unknown conductivity by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. It is generally believed that it leads to a nonconvex optimization problem which is riddled with bad local minimums. This has motivated the development of reconstruction methods based on convex optimization, one recent contribution being the nonlinear convex semidefinite programming approach of Harrach (2023). In this work, we investigate the computational viability of this convex approach in a simple setting where the conductivities are piecewise constant and radial. We implement this convex reconstruction method and compare it extensively to the least squares approach. Our experiments suggest that this convex programming approach only allows to accurately estimate the unknown for problems with a very small size. Moreover, surprisingly, it is consistently outperformed by Newton-type least squares solvers, which are also faster and require less measurements. We revisit the issue of nonconvexity in this piecewise constant radial setting and prove that, contrary to previous claims, there are no local minimums in the case of two scalar unknowns with no measurement noise. We also provide a partial proof of this result in the general setting which holds under a numerically verifiable assumption.</description>

      <title>Solving nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs equations with PINN-based policy iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.</description>
