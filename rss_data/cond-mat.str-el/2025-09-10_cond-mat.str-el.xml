      <title>Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.</description>

      <title>On the magnetization of electronic ground states in frustrated superstable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric frustration lies at the heart of many unconventional quantum phases in strongly interacting electron systems. Here, we analytically determine the ground state magnetization of the half-filled Hubbard model on frustrated geometries where superstable states -- eigenstates which are robust against frustration -- are manifest. Our results apply to a broad class of lattices, including those where altermagnetic and superconducting states are known to emerge. Furthermore, they provide evidence for phase transitions involving a geometric rearrangement of magnetic correlations in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism revealed by polarized neutrons in MnF$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Weak phonon coupling to nematic quantum critical mode in $BaFe2(As1-xPx)2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the softening of the in-plane transverse acoustic phonon driven by electronic nematicity in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ using inelastic X-ray scattering, with a focus on the optimally doped sample ($x = 0.31$) sample, a system exhibiting signatures of a putative nematic quantum critical point and minimal disorder among iron pnictides. We observe only a modest softening of the phonon frequency and no evidence of critical damping, suggesting that the nematic quantum critical fluctuations couple only weakly to the lattice from our quantum critical model. Given the close proximity of the structural and magnetic transition temperatures in the underdoped sample, which implies that spin-nematic fluctuations couple strongly to the lattice. We conjecture that the quantum critical nematic fluctuations are predominantly orbital in origin.</description>

      <title>Kondo echo dynamics of terahertz-pumped heavy fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the nonequilibrium temporal dynamics of correlated electron systems for realistic system parameters and the consequent, often exponentially long time scales. It is based on an entirely integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory, the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of the emergent gauge field in composite-fermion metals: A large-scale microscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of $S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$, and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the $q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in $S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which also obtains its coefficient accurately.</description>

      <title>Single-ion anisotropy driven chiral magnetic order in a spin-1 antiferromagnetic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality in magnetic systems gives rise to a wide range of exotic phenomena, yet its influence in $S=1$ chains remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental study of a chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) $S=1$ chain, [Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{4}$]SO$_{4} \cdot$ H$_{2}$O (pym = pyrimidine), where the Ni(II) octahedral orientation exhibits a four-fold chiral periodicity. Muon spin rotation measurements indicate the onset of long-range magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 1.82(2)\,\mathrm{K}$. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the easy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order interactions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal dispersive spin-wave excitations well described by linear spin-wave theory, with Hamiltonian parameters $J_{0} = 6.81(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (intrachain exchange), $J'_{1\rm a} = -0.091(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (interchain exchange), and $D = -3.02(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (easy-axis single-ion anisotropy). These parameters are further validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetisation. Additionally, the INS data reveal multiple dispersionless bands, suggesting the presence of further excitations beyond the scope of our linear spin-wave theory.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Topological $X$-Gates via Braiding of Majorana Zero Modes in an Interacting Quantum Dot System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum dot platforms have opened new pathways for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and simulating topological quantum computation. Here we propose an experimentally feasible setup for implementing topological $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates in an interacting $Y$-shaped quantum-dot array. The proposed novel architecture enables both braiding and charge readout through simple fusion operations controlled by gate-tunable potentials. Using many-body time-dependent simulations based on exact diagonalization, we analyze the braiding and fusion dynamics of MZMs in the presence of nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions and pairing disorder. We compute diabatic errors, braiding fidelity, and the time- and space-resolved electron and hole components of the local density of states to monitor the braiding process. Our results show that even weak interactions or pairing disorder induce oscillations in the braiding fidelity, thereby setting an upper bound on the braiding speed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparing fusion outcomes before and after braiding provides a direct and experimentally accessible signature of the non-Abelian nature of MZMs in quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases in Twisted Homobilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides - specifically twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ - have recently emerged as a versatile platform for strongly correlated and topological phases of matter. These two-dimensional systems host tunable flat Chern bands in which Coulomb interactions can dominate over kinetic energy, giving rise to a variety of interaction-driven phenomena. A series of groundbreaking experiments have revealed a rich landscape of quantum phases, including integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, quantum spin Hall states, anomalous Hall metals, zero-field composite Fermi liquids, and unconventional superconductors, along with more conventional topologically trivial correlated states including antiferromagnets. This review surveys recent experimental discoveries and theoretical progress in understanding these phases, with a focus on the key underlying mechanisms - band topology, electron interactions, symmetry breaking, and charge fractionalization. We emphasize the unique physics of twisted TMD homobilayers in comparison to other related systems, discuss open questions, and outline promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements under pulsed magnetic fields over 40 T using a compact sample fixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. Pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noises originating from field pulses. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE of various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, largely extending limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate materials properties in pulsed fields.</description>

      <title>Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can change by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, by generalizing the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects, this study shows that various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators, can induce electronic modes. The emergent modes can change the band structure, provided that a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a moment. The origins and dispersion relations of the emergent modes are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The theoretical results are validated by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the changes in the band structure driven by spin and charge perturbations and paves the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, utilizing the unconventional characteristics of strongly correlated insulators.</description>

      <title>Polarizability of a Wigner crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the imaginary part of the polarizability of a Wigner crystal using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. The oscillations of the localized electrons about their equilibrium positions are treated in the harmonic approximation and the electric dipole-moment -- dipole-moment correlator is computed by a normal mode expansion. The amplitudes and phases of the different normal modes are assumed to be statistically independent. In the first case, polarizability is computed in the high temperature limit, $k_B T&gt;&gt;\hbar \Omega_W$ (here, $\Omega_W$ is the Wigner frequency, analogous to the Debye frequency of the phonon case). In the second case, a general expression (valid both at high and low temperature limits) is obtained using a phenomenological damping model. The connection between our general expression and that of the Lorentz oscillator model is discussed. It turns out that the Wigner crystal would be transparent for applied frequencies greater than the Wigner frequency. A standard ellipsometry set-up can test the predictions of the theory.</description>

      <title>Spin susceptibility in a pseudogap state with fluctuating spiral magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a N\'eel or spiral magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility $\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping, $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature $T_{\rm nem} &lt; T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime below $T^*$.</description>

      <title>Cavity-induced Eliashberg effect: superconductivity vs charge density wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium, we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order. In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast, the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends on the targeted phases.</description>

      <title>UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT) with an exact diagonalization (ED) impurity solver faces exponential scaling limitations from the Hilbert space dimension. We introduce subbath CDMFT (SB-CDMFT), an alternative to the conventional CDMFT-ED method in which the discrete bath is subdivided into separate subbaths, each coupled to the cluster with distinct hybridization functions. In this approach, only one subbath at a time is actively involved in ED, dramatically reducing the computational cost by replacing a single large impurity problem with multiple smaller separate ones. Our method successfully reproduces key physical properties including particle-hole symmetry and Mott physics, while allowing for an extended bath representation at a fraction of the typical computational cost.</description>

      <title>Two-legged approximation for building non-empirical hybrids and analyzing correlation at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm dense matter is a highly energetic phase characterized by strong correlations, thermal effects, and quantum effects of electrons. Thermal density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the exchange-correlation free energy. In this work, a finite-temperature extension of the two-legged adiabatic connection construction is demonstrated for the uniform electron gas and asymmetric Hubbard dimer at warm dense matter conditions. This provides the structure of a temperature- and density-dependent weighting scheme for a hybrid exchange-correlation approximation. The construction also provides evidence that nonlinear thermal effects on the balance between exchange and correlation, as well as that between kinetic, entropic, and potential components of the correlation, persist and can even be emphasized by strong electron-electron interaction. These findings point additionally to a complicated interplay between temperature, density, and interaction strength in the strong correlation character of these model systems.</description>

      <title>Fourier Neural Operators for Time-Periodic Quantum Systems: Learning Floquet Hamiltonians, Observable Dynamics, and Operator Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</description>

      <title>Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Structural Phase Transition in CeMnSi under Pressure and Comparative Structural Properties of $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction experiments under pressure up to $\sim$10 GPa were performed on tetragonal CeFeSi-type $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd). A structural phase transition was observed in CeMnSi at a critical pressure of $P_{\rm s}$ $\sim$ 5.7 GPa. In contrast, LaMnSi, PrMnSi, and NdMnSi do not exhibit any structural transitions within the same pressure range. The lattice parameter ratio $c/a$ of CeMnSi decreases rapidly as pressure approaches $P_{\rm s}$, whereas the $c/a$ ratios of the other $R$MnSi increase monotonically with pressure. CeMnSi also shows a relatively small bulk modulus: $B_0$ $\sim$ 41.4(4) GPa in the 0--2 GPa range and $B_0$ $\sim$ 32.8(2) GPa in the 4--5 GPa range, suggesting valence instability under pressure. The structural transition in CeMnSi is attributed to the pressure-induced decrease in $c/a$ and its low bulk modulus. Above $P_{\rm s}$, the X-ray diffraction pattern indicates a transition to a monoclinic structure with space group No. 11, $P2_1/m$. These findings highlight the unique pressure response of CeMnSi and provide insight into the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom in Ce-based intermetallic systems.</description>

      <title>Examining density wave correlations in high pressure $\rm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ through variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, a nickelate compound with a reported superconducting transition temperature of $\rm 80~K$, has attracted significant attention in recent years.Density-wave phenomena arising from strong electron correlations are widely regarded as key to unraveling the superconductivity mechanism, but the ordering and stability of these density waves remain a subject of contention in existing theoretical studies. In this work, we employ the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to thoroughly examine the nature of density waves as functions of Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions in bilayer two-orbital model proposed for the high pressure phase of $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$. We analyse the spin and charge correlation functions in a wide range of parameter space, and delineate a schematic phase diagram that separates different density-wave ground states. Our results provide useful insights into the understanding of electron correlations in $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, and highlight the potential of VMC to elucidate its superconducting mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our high-throughput computational screening of the Materials Project database has identified 140 candidate materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic behavior in the $Pnma$ space group. Through systematic density functional theory calculations comparing various magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that 91 of these compounds preferentially stabilize in altermagnetic ground states, with 20 adopting the perovskite structure. Using NaCoF$_3$ as a prototypical example, we perform a comprehensive investigation of its electronic structure, magnetic ordering, and orbital configurations. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions occupy the 4c Wyckoff position and support three distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, among which the $G$-AFM configuration emerges as the ground state. Detailed symmetry analysis uncovers that the inter-sublattice coupling in the $G$-AFM phase is mediated by the combined time-reversal and rotation operation $\hat{T}\{R_{2x}|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. This unique symmetry protection gives rise to several remarkable physical phenomena: (i) anisotropic optical conductivity, (ii) prominent anomalous transport effects including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Nernst effect (ANE), and thermal Hall effect (ATHE), and (iii) strong magneto-optical responses manifested through both Kerr and Faraday effects.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</description>

      <title>Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic driving of quantum dots is analyzed as a basis for developing dynamic switching devices. We study transport through periodically modulated energy levels which are coupled to leads via tunneling coefficients. Utilizing Floquet theory a full analytic solution is found in terms of continued fractions, enabling us to efficiently calculate and analyze the transmission through the quantum dot in relevant parameter regimes. By considering levels at higher energy outside the spectrum of the transmitted particles a resonant switching effects is identified, where a very small oscillating control signal on a weakly connected quantum dot can induce perfect transmission. We also find closed form expressions using Bessel functions in the limit of small tunnel couplings. The results predict and explain resonant tunneling in nano-electronic devices as well as in corresponding setups using magnonic systems, photonic waveguides, or ultra-cold gases in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Unusual magnetic order in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solid-state compounds, the valence of europium can sometimes be mixed -- which is especially favored in structures with several positions for the europium atoms. In this work, we study the Eu-based intermetallic noncentrosymmetric system Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ which has 65 atoms per unit cell and 4 distinct crystallographic positions for europium and 17 positions for mercury. Our detailed analysis of magnetism of large single crystals suggests that europium in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ might be present in two valence states, resulting in a fragile magnetic ground state. Due to the cage-like structure with a large distance between the Eu atoms, those atoms are weakly ferromagnetically coupled and Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ orders at low temperatures, below $T_{1} = 5.5$ K, with a subsequent spin re-orientation at $T_{2} = 4.3$ K. There is no sign of magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the magnetic ordering of europium sub-lattices results in a magnetization pole reversal with a weak ferrimagnetic ground state. Additional magnetic phases can be induced by application of a modest external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Valley Order in Moir\'e Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials with opposite non-zero miniband Chern numbers in time-reversal-partner valleys are two-dimensional topological insulators at band filling $\nu=2$. We explore the possibility that in this class of moir'e materials intervalley coherence can sometimes be present in interaction induced insulators at band filling $\nu=1$ , using Landau levels with opposite signs of the magnetic field as a convenient generic model. In the absence of intravalley interactions the mean-field ground state at filling factor $\nu=1$ is a gapless intervalley coherent state that maps under a particle-hole transformation of one valley to a strong-field superconducting vortex-lattice state that has been studied previously. When the ratio $\lambda$ of intravalley to intervalley interactions is increased, gapped states appear, one with broken time-reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall effect but no valley polarization and one with broken parity symmetry and zero Hall conductivity. We discuss the possibility that the latter state could be related to the fractional quantum spin Hall effect recently observed at an odd filling factor in a moir'e topological insulator and comment on related systems in which correlations between electrons in bands with opposite Chern numbers might play a key role.</description>

      <title>Temperature and magnetic field dependent $g$-factors in electron spin resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that phonons coupled to electrons play an important role in both the fundamental phenomenology of electron spin resonance as well as the interpretation of such measurements. By including spin-dependent electron-phonon interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that the g-factor acquires emergent temperature dependencies that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, we predict that at low temperatures, the $g$-factor will exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the magnetic field, indicating a dynamic property that has not been previously considered in electron-phonon systems. We further predict the influence of phonons to be negligible at very low and very high temperatures, with the former requiring experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry for fractional excitations: Unified framework and dip width scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory (UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Symmetry TFTs for Continuous Spacetime Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.</description>

      <title>Linking thermodynamic correlation signatures and superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands. We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h) asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands. Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead, its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum critical points in fermionic systems with spin-charge separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04073v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are intriguing transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm which are usually identified by the appearance of a continuous phase transition between locally ordered phases. Here, we reveal the presence of deconfined quantum critical points with unexplored properties. Contrary to previously known examples, we show that the phenomenon of spin-charge separation peculiar to interacting low dimensional fermions can allow for the appearance of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. We first infer this point by performing a field theory analysis of generic one-dimensional fermionic systems in the low energy limit. Subsequently, we derive a microscopic model where phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can take place. Here, by performing a numerical analysis we explicitly derive, among others, the gaps, local order parameters and correlation functions behavior, supporting the presence of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. Our results thus provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states</title>

Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.</description>

      <title>Metallic $p$-wave magnet with commensurate spin helix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}&gt;600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $&gt;3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.</description>

      <title>Systematic Mapping of Altermagnetic Magnons by Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Circular Dichroism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the $g$-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Mott transition in a two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) as impurity solvers. Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J &gt; 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.</description>

      <title>EuAuSb: An odd-parity helical variation on altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EuAuSb is a triangular-lattice Dirac semimetal in which a topological Hall effect has been observed to develop in association with a magnetically-ordered phase. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements have identified an incommensurate helical order in which individual ferromagnetic Eu$^{2+}$ layers rotate in-plane by $\sim$120$^{\circ}$ from one layer to the next. An in-plane magnetic field distorts the incommensurate order, eventually leading to a first order transition to a state that is approximately commensurate and that is continuously polarized as the bulk magnetization approaches saturation. From an analysis of the magnetic diffraction intensities versus field, we find evidence for a dip in the ordered in-plane moment at the same field where the topological Hall effect is a maximum, and we propose that this is due to field-induced quantum spin fluctuations. Our electronic structure calculations yield exchange constants compatible with the helical order and show that the bands near the Fermi level lose their spin degeneracy via a mechanism similar to that in the collinear altermagnets. We find that, unlike the even symmetry seen in the altermagnets, the spin-splitting in EuAuSb has odd-wave symmetry similar to that recently found in a number of coplanar magnetic materials.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dimer magnet, with antiferromagnetic intradimer and interdimer Heisenberg exchange between spin-1/2 moments, is known to host an up/down - down/up singlet ground state when the intradimer exchange is dominant. Rare-earth-based quantum dimer systems with strong spin-orbit coupling offer the opportunity for tuning their magnetic properties by using magnetic anisotropy as a control knob. Here, we present bulk characterization and neutron scattering measurements of the quantum dimer magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$. We find that the Yb$^{3+}$ ions can be described by an effective spin-1/2 model at low temperatures and the system does not show signs of magnetic order down to 50 mK. The magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron spectroscopy data can be well-described by an isolated dimer model with highly anisotropic exchange that stabilizes a singlet ground state with a wavefunction up/up - down/down or up/up + down/down. Our results show that strong spin-orbit coupling can induce novel entangled states of matter in quantum dimer magnets.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Edge modes of topological Mott insulators and deconfined quantum critical points</title>

Abstract: Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations.We also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Boundary operator product expansion coefficients of the three-dimensional Ising universality class</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in conformal field theory and critical phenomena have focused on the characterization of boundary or defects in a conformally invariant system. In this Letter we study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional Ising universality class in the presence of a surface, realizing the ordinary, the special, and the normal universality classes. By combining high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, with a finite-size scaling analysis informed by conformal field theory, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients of experimental relevance. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Transport Mediated by Fractionalized Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport in systems composed of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. For example, $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$ either intrinsically doped or in proximity to graphene. Our analysis reveals distinct temperature-dependent transport behaviors due to the QSL gap and the Majorana excitation spectrum, which are greatly enhanced when the velocities of itinerant-electrons and QSL excitations become comparable. These transport characteristics could potentially be employed to reveal the fractionalized excitations of the spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computation of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>
